FP00003985_Rev4,19,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY Tracking evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread often requires the use of data deposited in public databases such as GenBank, the Influenza Research Database (IRD), or the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR). GenBank provides an abundance of available viral sequence data for phylogeography. Sequences and their metadata can be downloaded and imported into software applications that generate phylogeographic trees and models for surveillance. IRD and ViPR are NIH/NIAID funded programs that import data from GenBank but contain additional data sources, visualization, and search tools for their users. Tracking evolutionary changes and spread also requires the geospatial assignment of taxa, which is often obtained from GenBank metadata. Unfortunately, geospatial metadata such as host location is often uncertain in GenBank entries, with only 36% containing a precise location such as a county, town, or region within a state. For example, information such as China or USA was indicated instead of Beijing or Bedford, NH. While town or county might be included in the corresponding journal article, this valuable information is not available for immediate use unless it is extracted and then linked back to the appropriate sequence. The goal of our work is to enable health agencies and other researchers to automatically generate phylogeographic models that incorporate enhanced geospatial data for better estimates of virus spread. This proposal focuses on developing and applying information extraction and statistical phylogeography approaches to enhance models that track evolutionary changes in viral genomes and their spread. We propose a framework that uses natural language processing (NLP) for the automatic extraction of relevant geospatial data from the literature, and assigns a confidence between such geospatial mentions and the GenBank record. We will then use these locations and the estimates as observation error in the creation of phylogeographic models of zoonotic virus spread. We hypothesize that a combined NLP-phylogeography infrastructure that produces models that include observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa will be closer to a gold standard than phylogeographic models that do not include them. Our research will extend phylogeography and zoonotic surveillance by: creating a NLP infrastructure that will improve the level of detail of geospatial data for phylogeography of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1), develop phylogeographic models using the estimates from Aim 1 as observation error (Aim 2), and evaluating our approach by comparing the models it produces to models that do not account for observation error in the geospatial assignment of taxa (Aim 3). We will allow users to generate enhanced models and view results on a web portal accessible via a LinkOut feature from GenBank, IRD, and ViPR. The addition of more precise geospatial information in building such models could enable health agencies to better target areas that represent the greatest public health risk. ",

FP00007554_Rev3,5,,,,,1,,,"Identification of Autoantibody Biomarkers against Post-Translationally Modified Proteins for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer A. Overview Our overarching goal is to identify biomarkers that can facilitate accurate and early diagnosis in the context of mammography.  Glycosylated  proteins  with  truncated  O-glycans  are  enriched  in  cancer  patients  relative  to healthy controls.  Since altered post-translational modifications are highly immunogenic, we hypothesize that these aberrantly glycosylated proteins can elicit tumor associated autoantibodies against glycoproteins (TAAb-AGP) that can serve as markers for the early detection of breast in conjunction with current imaging modalities. We  propose  the  development  of  a  high-throughput  strategy  to  generate  and  display  synthetic  O-linked glycoprotein  structures  that  mimic  tumor-specific  structural  changes  on  our  innovative  contra  capture  array platform, encompassing known TAAbs, cancer-relevant glycoproteins, and single-pass transmembrane proteins. We will identify TAAb-AGP biomarkers using these glycoprotein arrays by comparing sero-reactivity between cancer patients and control sera.  Our specific aims included: Aim 1: Development of a multiplexed platform to produce O-glycosylation proteins  The contra capture platform  will  be  used  to  generate  post  translational  modification  (PTM)  protein  microarrays,  which  is  an improvement of  HD  NAPPA  that  was  previously  utilized.  The  apparatus  will  be  developed  to  accommodate ~2000  displayed  proteins  including  optimization  of  printing  in  PDMS  wells.  To  perform  post  translation modification on arrays, an in-solution glycosylation protocol will be optimized to be used for on array for both Tn and STn O-glycosylation PTMs.  Aim 2: Proteome scale glycoprotein array development and production  To have a complete collection of breast  cancer  antigens  on  the  protein  microarrays,  we  will  utilize  reported  tumor  associated  autoantibodies (TAAbs), cancer-relevant O-glycoproteins, as well as the most complete mucin collection. These antigens will be cloned into NAPPA expression vectors to ensure fresh protein expression on the arrays for both native and PTMs.  Aim 3: Identification of anti-glycoprotein antibody (TAAb-AGP) biomarkers in breast cancer  Arrays will be used to screen native, Tn-modified, and STn modified antigens to assess novel TAAb-AGP for the early detection of breast cancer. There will be ~2000 antigens displayed on the arrays and analyzed for differences in native  and  O-glycosylated  antigens.  Those  antigens  which  display  strong  differences  between  native  and modified antigens will then be validated using RAPID-ELISA.   B. Accomplishments During the funding period, we have developed the contra capture array platform for the study of TAAb-AGP. We have optimized the process and established quality control measures to improve the data quality. We have expanded the content of the arrays to display 1632 unique genes comprising O-glycoproteome, mucins, breast cancer autoantigens and membrane or secreted proteins highly expressed in breast cancer. We have profiled TAAb-AGP in breast cancer using serum samples acquired from women with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3 or 4 from Provista 001 and 002 multicenter clinical studies, whose case and control statuses were later determined by biopsy after mammogram screening. Serum screening are performed against native, Tn, STn and core3 glycosylated proteins and detected using anti-hIgG and anti-hIgM antibodies labeled with different Alexa fluor. IgM secondary antibodies were selected due to their reported relevance to anti-glycan antibodies.  We  have  completed  screening  IgG  and  IgM  TAAb-AGP  in  40  cases  with  breast  cancer  and  40 controls with benign breast disease. In addition, through the EDRN ovarian set-aside project, we have performed validation studies for AAb detection of 977 samples to the following proteins: TP53, CTAG1a, CTAG2, as well as CA4, ICAM3, KSR1, NIDT11, NXF3, POMC, PVR-B, STYXL1, TRIM39, and UHMK1. C. Work in progress For each of the 3 types of O-glycosylation form, we have selected ~160 candidates with high specificity, greater than 15% sensitivity at 95% specificity, or high sensitivity, greater than 40% sensitivity at 80% specificity. Arrays displaying target antigens of candidate antibodies will be produced for each form.  We will repeat the evaluation of the TAAb-AGP biomarkers using targeted arrays with selected proteins using the 80 discovery samples. We will confirm the performance of candidate antibodies in independent set of 180 serum samples (40 cases and 130 group matched benign disease controls) with same clinical characteristics as the discovery set. We expect the completion of the confirmation using the Provista samples by the end of the 5-year funding period.       D. Proposed plan For the extended funding period, we propose to complete the confirmation and the blind validation, which we proposed  in  our  original  proposal  but  was  delayed  due  to  the  pandemic.  We  also  propose  to  map immunodominant epitopes for the target antigens of the top validated TAAb-AGP markers.  D.1. Evaluation of biomarker performance in Her2+ and TNBC breast cancer subtypes We recognize that the majority (>60%) of breast cancer cases in both of our sample sets will be ER+, and that potentially  useful  biomarkers  for  Her2+  and  TNBC  cancers  may  be  missed.  We  will  also  evaluate  the performance of the top ~160 candidates with sera from 60 invasive Her2+ breast cancer patients, 60 invasive TNBC breast cancer patients, and 60 benign breast disease controls, all matched for age and gender. We will select candidate biomarkers (n  30) with the high sensitivity and high specificity for each subtype. D.2. Evaluation of biomarker performance in serous ovarian cancer.  Our data demonstrates that the TAAb-AGP biomarkers are present in serum samples from women with breast cancer, but the specificity for breast cancer, in comparison to other tumor types is not known.  Ovarian cancer, in particular, is known to have tumor-specific altered glycosylation (i.e., MUC16, CA125).  In addition to tumor subtype analysis, we will also evaluate the performance of the top ~160 candidates with sera from 60 newly diagnosed serous ovarian cancer patients, and 60 healthy age-matched controls from the set-aside project.  D.2. TAAb-AGP Validation D.2.2. Patients and samples Candidate antibody biomarkers will be validated using cases and age- and gender-matched controls from the EDRN breast cancer reference set. This set contains samples from women collected at diagnosis with incident invasive cancer, carcinoma in situ, benign pathology with atypia, benign disease with no atypia, and women with no  evidence  of  breast  disease  by  screening  mammography.  These  samples  will  be  run  blinded  to  the investigators. We originally planned for 50 cases and 50 controls. We propose to increase the sample numbers to 100 cases and 100 controls.  D.2.3. Adopting Multiple In-Solution Protein Array (MISPA) for the study of TAAb-AGP We originally planned the use of RAPID-ELISA (Rapid Antigenic Protein In Situ Display) for the validation of our candidate antibody markers. However, the signal to noise ratio we observed during our preliminary testing was  not  ideal  for  the  study  of  TAAb-AGP.  Therefore,  we  will  use  our  recently  developed  innovative  highly multiplexed and quantitative Multiple In-Solution Protein Array (MISPA), which integrates immunoassays with the unprecedented power of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, for the validation. As shown in Fig.1, antigens covalently barcoded with unique DNA sequences are immunoprecipitated by antibodies in patient serum, followed by quantitative assessment of the DNA barcode using NGS to assess antibody concentrations. In brief, in vitro produced FLAG/HaloTagged proteins using human (HeLa cell) lysates are isolated with anti-FLAG antibody-coated magnetic beads and each is attached to a unique 12-nt DNA barcode oligo covalently using  HaloTag  ligand  conjugated  to  a  universal  DNA  linker.  The  barcoded  proteins  will  be  pooled  and glycosylated  to  generate  the  candidate  antigen  library,  which  is  then  incubated  individually  with  the  serum samples in 96 well plates. Antibody-antigen complexes are isolated with magnetic beads (e.g., protein A/G) and PCR-amplified with the universal primers for linker sequences. The amplified barcodes are subjected to another few cycles of PCR to add the Illumina sequencing adaptors along with a unique sample index sequence. After NGS  on  the  pooled  amplicon  samples,  the  unique  barcode  counts  for  each  protein  are  normalized  by  the corresponding  counts  in  the  input  candidate  antigen  library.  MISPA  allows  for  molecular  interactions  in  an aqueous phase, a substantial advantage over conventional assays that display proteins fixed on a solid surface and  outperforms  many  fluorescent-based  detection  systems  with  a  4  log  dynamic  range  (limited  only  by sequencing depth) and increased signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio due to the intrinsically digital nature of NGS, allowing robust detection of even weak antibody responses that are likely missed by other assays. In addition to the multiplexing capability for testing tens of candidate antigens in parallel, individual reactions can also be uniquely indexed and pooled, which allows measuring antibody response in hundreds of patient samples with a single NGS  run.  Further,  as  all  the  steps  are  performed  in  aqueous  solutions,  the  entire  process  can  be  readily automated. D.2.4. Study plan We  will  select  candidate  biomarkers  with  high  sensitivity  or  high  specificity  for  the  mixed  breast  cancer population and its subtypes. We will avoid those showing high reactivity in ovarian cancers, benign disease, or healthy controls. We will validate up to 30 candidate antibody biomarkers each for native and the 3 types of  O-glycosylated  antigens  for  MISPA  validation. Antibodies  against  candidate  antigens,  with appropriate glycosylation, in parallel with 2 control proteins:  1)  HaloTag-FLAG  fusion  alone  (without human genes); 2) Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused  with  HaloTag-FLAG  tags,  will  be  assayed. Serum samples will be incubated with the barcoded O-glycosylated antigen pool in solution. Antibody-antigen  complexes  will  be  isolated  with  anti-IgM-Ab-, or protein G-coated beads, attached with the dual  indexes  (for  patient  barcodes)  and  Illumina adaptors via PCR, pooled, and subjected to NGS and  barcode  deconvolution.  Serially  diluted commercial anti-GFP antibody will be included in each experiment to generate a standard curve to calculate antibody concentrations in each sample. All assays will be done in triplicate, and the antibody concentration for each antibody will be calculated by comparing the input-normalized barcode counts (i.e., assay read counts/input library read counts) to the standard curve for the anti-GFP antibody.  Fig.1. MISPA pipeline D.2.5. Statistical analysis plan  We will analyze the 30 candidate markers that were selected from our previous discovery (pre-screening and confirmation)  samples  using  the  independent  validation  samples.  We  will  determine  individual  marker sensitivities,  specificities,  positive  predictive  values,  and  negative  predictive  values  for  discriminating  with invasive breast cancer from benign breast disease using the same cutoff values from the discovery samples. We will also determine a panel of markers using machine learning methods such as lasso or random forest in the discovery  and  blinded  validation  approach.  The  receiver  operating  characteristics  curve  analysis  will  be performed  for  the  panel  to  assess  its  classification  performances.  Additional  exploratory  analyses  of  the validation  data  using  penalized  logistic  regression  will  examine  the  effect  of  tumor  subtype,  age,  BI-RADS categories, breast density, and other demographic and clinical characteristics on the invasive breast cancer. Based  on  the  statistical  significance  of  these  independent  variables,  adjusted  odds  ratios  for  cases  versus controls will also be calculated. D.2.6. Power Analysis  With  100  breast  cancer  patients  and  100  benign  disease  controls,  if  there  are  16  markers  with  either  80% specificity at 40% sensitivity or 30% sensitivity at 95% specificity among the 30 candidate markers selected from the discovery samples, the power is 87% to identify true markers at the corrected 0.05 significance level. These calculations  were  made  using  a  Monte  Carlo  power  analysis  for  binary  marker  data  using  the  marker specifications indicated above. ",

FP00008520_Rev2,7,,,,,1,,,"IntroductionSince the initial descriptions of psychosis and schizophrenia, speech/language impairments are in the core symptomatology that describes the phenomenology associated with this mental suffering (some grouped in a set of symptoms described as formal thought disorder -FTD - accessed through speech/language). In recent years, different natural language processing tools (NLP) have efficiently measured aspects of FTD, helping the prediction of negative and cognitive symptomatology linked to psychosis, and the early identification of schizophrenia (even during the first episode), or conversion to psychosis (at the prodromal phase). There is major potential in learning which aspects of the FTD phenomenology, including the characteristic cognitive impairment, are associated with those NLP measurements in different clinical contexts, such as during the prodromal phase.HypothesesAccording to the literature in schizophrenia, we hypothesize that negative symptomatology, as well as cognitive performance will be associated with NLP markers, and predictive of remission of the attenuated symptoms. In addition, we expect that the rate and rhythm of speech will be associated with negative and positive symptoms. Furthermore, acoustic features correlated with pause in speech will be related to negative features such as avolition; whereas the increased rate of speech will be correlated with incoherence. ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to understand the phenomenological and cognitive associations of NLP metrics (structural, semantic and acoustic levels) from a short oral narrative protocol in the context of clinical high risk for psychosis - CHR, and to verify the validity of these speech/language markers for prediction of remission of attenuated psychotic symptomatology.",

FP00010891_Rev4,14,,,,,1,,,"Controlling Resistance in Hormone Refractory Breast Cancer Draft Summary   One of our most important problems in oncology is the fact that our drugs select for mutant cells that are resistant to those drugs, resulting in recurrence of cancers that are no longer responsive to those drugs. Eventually, we run out of effective drugs, and the patient succumbs to their resistant cancer. Pest managers have largely the same problem with selection for resistance to pesticides. However, they have learned that resistance generally has a fitness cost, and chemosensitive pests can be used to out-compete resistant pests. Adaptive therapy is the translation of this idea to oncology  keep chemosensitive cancer cells alive to out-compete and control populations of chemoresistant cells. Variations of that strategy have been successful in three pre-clinical models and one pilot clinical trial. However, without computational modeling and mouse experiments, we do not know which variations on adaptive therapy protocols would be optimal. Our preliminary modeling results suggest that adjusting the dose of the chemotherapy is more effective than using drug holidays to control resistance. We will test this prediction in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer using our hormone refractory MCF7 cells, that we derived through treatment with standard breast cancer drugs (Fulvestrant and Palbociclib). We will fit mathematical models of clonal competition to our experimental results, to estimate the parameters of clonal competition and predict improved protocols for controlling resistance in breast cancer. We received a grant from the state of Arizona to run a pilot trial of adaptive therapy in hormone refractory breast cancer at the Mayo Clinic. However, the Mayo Clinic IRB is concerned that previous preclinical experiments were done on hormone responsive breast cancer (MCF7 cells). If we can show that adaptive therapy works in mice on the hormone refractory MCF7 cells, then we will be able to run our pilot clinical trial for patients with late stage, hormone refractory breast cancer. This study would launch the careers of two junior scientists at ASU studying adaptive therapy, and translate both modeling and mouse experimental methods from the Moffitt PSOC to the ASU CSBC center, and enable us to test adaptive therapy in breast cancer patients for the first time.

To improve safety, an understanding of the weaknesses in the current operations is important. A key capability is automated monitoring of  the  operating  environment  through  various  data/sensor  modalities  for  negative  risk  and corresponding alerts to prevent adverse safety events. Predictive models for safety events can be developed that leverage the advances in machine learning, sensors, and information technology, for  inexpensive,  robust  solutions.  The  project  can  also  include  automated  diagnoses  and recommendations to react to anomalies and prevent safety events.  A project to achieve these objectives can be framed as a system of components that increase the scope of data and operations monitored. An advantage is that a component to monitor, alert, and prevent safety events can be developed for each sector of operations over several phases to increase the scope of the solution. Each component would consist of hardware, software, sensors, data, and algorithms that consume the data, monitor, and generate safety alerts for preventive action, along with  diagnoses  and  recommendations  for  corrective  action.  Relevant  visualizations  to  help interpret the alert can also be provided.  This project will add video data collection to the ongoing project.  Budget $10,000  Budgeted funds will cover costs associated with supporting the salary and fringe benefits for one undergraduate student. The student will contribute effort to the project at a level of 0.71 summer person-months. The student will assist with translation of the research algorithms to FedEx.  Other project funds will contribute to the purchase of materials and lab supplies (i.e., cameras, servers for data storage) necessary to conduct the projects video data collection. Funds will also cover costs associated with renting equipment in an ASU lab facility space. In addition, funds will facilitate travel to a domestic machine learning conference to enable collaboration and learning with colleagues in the machine learning community. Indirect costs have been applied to applicable expenses.  ",

FP00011681_Rev2,17,,,,,1,,,"Title:   Eliminating COVID-19 disparities in Arizona in partnership with underserved/vulnerable communities  Abstract Arizona has one of the highest COVID-19 positivity test rates (approximately 19%) in the U.S. Positivity rates are disproportionally higher among Arizonas Latinx, American Indian and African American communities. The proposed community driven and culturally congruent intervention aims to increase access to testing by identifying and decreasing barriers to testing in vulnerable and underserved communities across Arizona. The intervention aims at reducing disparities in COVID-19 diagnostics, education, wraparound services and referrals to a primary care provider, with the ultimate goal of improving the health of underserved communities. The proposed approach empowers local communities, meets community members where they are, is data driven, and creates the infrastructure for continued community-driven delivery of care. Following a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) orientation, the project will: (a) identify and prioritize testing deserts, (b) coordinate testing at different levels of the social ecosystem, (c) engage and train local Community Health Workers (CHWs) deliver saliva-based COVID-19 testing to vulnerable and underserved community members, (d) deliver test results within 72 hours, (e) provide wrap-around services and provider referrals for those testing positive, and (f) sustain the intervention during a follow-up period. Equality Health Foundation serves as the lead community partner and convener of a growing COVID-19 Coalition of Communities of Color Partners (CCCCP) from across Arizona. The ASU Biodesign Clinical Testing Laboratory (ABCTL) will provide the saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic. The saliva tests main benefits are: a) minimal to no PPE requirements compared to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs; b) convenience and economy of specimen collection; c) ease of repeat sampling; d) administration by minimally trained CHWs and e) greater sensitivity and consistency of saliva tests than NP swabs. The project aims to administer 29,000 saliva tests, 10,000-12,000 at identified testing deserts during the launching period, doubling the numbers during the follow-up period in Year 1, and adding 5,000 tests in Year 2.  A longitudinal evaluation will assess the interventions impact by comparing randomly selected participants in the R.A.P.I.D. intervention during the launching period (N=500) with a matched comparison group (N=500) randomly selected from standard testing sites.

Majority Latinx and American Indian communities along this border have higher infection rates and less access to testing and vaccination. This proposed supplement aims to increase access to testing and related services for these underserved transnational communities. The expansion of our current community-driven and culturally congruent project will advance knowledge about barriers to care and effective strategies to increase testing and vaccination in the border region. This application extends the work of ASUs health disparities U54 center grant (RFA-MD-17-005; 5U54MD002316) and its RADx-UP supplement (3U54MD002316-14S1) by reducing disparities in COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccination, education, wraparound services and health care, with the goal of improving the health of vulnerable and underserved communities. The aims of this emergency competitive revision closely match and enhance the aims of the current U54 award and its RADx-UP supplement. The focus on populations along the AZ-Mexico border will add to existing knowledge about assets and vulnerabilities of diverse transnational communities disproportionally affected by the pandemic. The approach empowers local communities, is data driven, and creates the infrastructure capacity for community-driven delivery of care. Following a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) orientation, the revised supplement expands our existing R.A.P.I.D. program by improving access and decreasing hesitancy to COVID-19 testing and vaccination among underserved and vulnerable populations in the border region. Equality Health Foundation (EHF) will continue to serve as the lead community partner for the proposed revised supplement and the ASU Biodesign Clinical Testing Laboratory (ABCTL) will provide and analyze the saliva-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. Local partners coordinated by EHF under the One Community Initiative against COVID-19 will implement the vaccination program. Over two years, the revised supplement aims to reach 7,000 additional community members living and working along the AZ-Mexico border. CDCC surveys from border communities will be added to the ongoing longitudinal study we are conducting to assess the interventions impact and also by comparing randomly selected participants (N=200) with a matched comparison group (N=200) randomly selected from regular testing sites. We will also conduct ongoing COVID-19 variants sequence validation among those tested and inform appropriate health authorities if significant variants emerge.

FP00011681_Rev5,19,,,,,1,,,"Leveraging Biocultural Mechanisms to Increase the Impact of Multi-level  Preventable Disease Interventions with Southwest Populations  Project Summary/Abstract The proposed U54 Specialized Center will advance knowledge on how to prevent cardiometabolic disease and substance abuse disorders among the health disparities populations of the Southwest. The Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center (SIRC) has accumulated invaluable expertise in this area for the past 10 years as ASUs Exploratory Center of Excellence (NIMHD/NIH P20MD002316). The stark unmet health needs of the Southwest communities, the strong transdisciplinary team of researchers assembled for this application, and the existing solid community partnerships make this application highly significant.  The Specialized Center will leverage SIRCs accumulated knowledge on cultural and social determinants of health and health disparities and will integrate biological, sociocultural and other contextual factors into efficacious, culturally grounded and impactful health interventions. We will focus on understanding the protective and risk effects of interpersonal family and household factors, the community environment, and individual health behaviors on specific biological health outcomes. The Specialized Center will extend SIRCs integrated, multilevel, social determinants approach to include biocultural mechanisms within an Ecodevelopmental Theory framework. The proposed center will significantly enhance SIRCs research impact through a research focus on preventing cardio metabolic disease and substance abuse disorders through culturally appropriate and efficacious interventions. The proposed research is innovative because it will investigate how protective and risk factors that are common to various chronic diseases and disorders manifest themselves among racial/ethnic minority populations of the Southwest, with an emphasis on the sociocultural and biological determinants of health disparities. The two proposed main research projects will target potentially modifiable youth behaviors associated with cardiometabolic disease and with substance abuse disorders (i.e., physical activity, and quality of diet, access to healthy foods, family functioning, acculturation, substance use, and illegal drug availability).  The resulting findings will inform the design and testing of efficacious interventions that can strengthen protective factors and counteract risk factors operating within the multiple ecological domains of a young persons life.  The center will conduct the two related main research projects to increase the impact of efficacious interventions by advancing knowledge on how cultural processes influence biological vulnerabilities (i.e., biocultural mechanisms). Early career faculty and postdocs will increase their capacity to conduct health dipartites research through a comprehensive investigator development and pilots research incubator initiative. The center will implement the research projects and future pilots in close and equitable partnership with communities of the Southwest.  In partnership with the SIRC Community Advisory Board, the center will broadly disseminate and translate the knowledge generated by the studies and pilots to policy, practice, and lay stakeholders through an innovative dissemination plan.

FP00012016_Rev1,22,,,,,1,,,"Almost 43 million (about 1 in 8) adults in the U.S. have a physical disability that impairs mobility. People with mobility impairments (PMI) may be at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe disease due to health conditions underlying their disability and barriers to accessing health care. PMI experience multiple personal and ecologic (social, environmental) barriers to diagnostic services which have profound implications on including PMI in surveillance estimates, diminishing the ability to address underlying health disparities, allocate resources, and inform policy related to unmet needs of this population. This study proposes to investigate ecologic factors influencing access to and acceptability of diagnostic services. To date, no theoretically-guided strategy or measure exists to comprehensively capture these factors and guide diagnostic services to improve health equity in PMI. Evidence-based products to provide best practice and policy tools, information, and guidelines are woefully inadequate or nonexistent. Herein, we propose to leverage deep existing partnerships, adapt seminal theoretical work, and borrow methodological expertise from the parent grant (1R21HD095380-01). Building on our extensive combined experience working with our partners, we propose a study to first develop a measure to understand the perception of diagnostic services (testing, return of results, and vaccination preparedness) from the perspective of PMI. We will use a cohort design and follow a panel of 500 PMI to monitor how these perceptions change over time in response to a rapidly changing pandemic situation. The panel will complete surveys about facilitators and barriers that are associated with individual- (disability severity, sociodemographics, and social determinants of health) meso- (family/housemate experiences) and macro-level (rural/urban area, social determinants of health) constructs. We will monitor how these facilitators and barriers change over time in anticipation of and in response to receiving diagnostic services. We will investigate additional exo-level ecologic facilitators and barriers that likely influence access to and experiences with diagnostic services using interviews with 80 health care providers linked to a subsample of the panel of survey participants. This panel subsample of survey participants will also assess facilitators and barriers in their lived micro-, and meso-level environments via a Photovoice data collection protocol. We will work with our CAB and partners to create a knowledge translation (KT) plan to deploy measurement tools, educational information, and best-practice guidelines via our website, blog, social media and other partners. This study and its resulting products will accelerate future research, policy and practice improving accessibility and acceptability of COVID-19 diagnostic services. We anticipate discovery and innovation from this project to yield products that are scalable for other communities, languages, or future epidemic scenarios.",
FP00012040,23,,,,,1,,,"Children born preterm are at risk for many types of developmental disorders but especially disorders of speech and language. Typically, speech and language disorders cannot be assessed and treated until children are old enough to showsymptoms, age 2 to 3 years. Despite treatment, many children born preterm continue to struggle. The known risk in preterm children for these disorders can be leveraged to investigate whether a comprehensive course of proactive intervention improves speech and language outcomes. The Babble Boot Camp (BBC) is a program of activities and routines designed to support the acquisition of prespeech (birth to 12 months) and early speech and language (12 to 24 months). It is currently undergoing clinical trial in infants with classic galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism that,like preterm birth, puts children at risk for speech and language disorders. Initial results are consistent with beneficial effects. The next step is to evaluate the BBC in a larger population of children at risk, those born preterm. This study is a randomized control clinical trial with three randomized treatment and two nonrandomized untreatedcontrol groups. Infants born at 32-36 weeks gestation enter the study soon after birth and are randomized into three treatment groups: Extremely Early Intervention (begins soon after birth with language enrichment and fostering earliest signals of communication), Very Early Intervention (begins at corrected age 7 months with babble), and Early Intervention (begins at corrected age 15 months with focus on word production). Prior to entering the Babble Boot Camp, the children in the Very Early and Early groups will receive an alternate treatment focusing on motor skills. Typicalinfants make up one untreated control group; the second one consists of toddlers and preschoolers born preterm who are too old for the BBC and who will provide once-yearly assessment data. Treatment is implemented by pediatric speechlanguagepathologists via parent training. Parents learn activities and routines that support typical development, for instance talking to their child frequently right from birth, stimulating and reinforcing vocalizations and babble, shaping first words, and building vocabulary and sentence complexity. Children in all treatment groups and the typical control group are closely monitored from birth to 24 months with longitudinal measures of prespeech, speech, language, and linguistic environment. Measures of quality of life and child development including cognition are also collected to capture any indirect treatment effects. After the intervention ends at child age 2 years, follow-up testing of all outcome domains is performed once yearly. Using multilevel growth curve models, treatment effects will be evaluated longitudinally and follow-up testing of all outcome domains is performed once yearly. Using multilevel growth curve models, treatment effects will be evaluated longitudinally and through group comparisons, while also measuring the impact of gestational age and familial factors. Expected results willshow that proactive services improve speech and language outcomes, providing objective evidence to change clinical management from deficit-based to proactive services and to consider infants with other risk types. Indirect benefits for cognition and quality of life are possible. This study has potential to enhance health and reduce disease burdens of speech and language disorders. It fits a high NIH funding priority by developing and implementing treatment for intellectual and developmental disorders with the potential of improving quality of life and cognitive and behavioral  manifestations.",

The Babble Boot Camp (BBC) is a program of activities and routines designed to support the acquisition of prespeech (birth to 12 months) and early speech and language (12 to 24 months). It is currently undergoing clinical trial in infants with classic galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism that, like preterm birth, puts children at risk for speech and language disorders. Initial results are consistent with beneficial effects. The next step is to evaluate the BBC in a larger population of children at risk, those born preterm.This study is a randomized control clinical trial with three randomized treatment and two nonrandomized untreated control groups. Infants born at/before 36 weeks gestation enter the study soon after birth and are randomized into three treatment groups: Extremely Early Intervention (begins soon after birth with language enrichment and fostering earliest signals of communication), Very Early Intervention (begins at corrected age 7 months with babble), and Early Intervention (begins at corrected age 15 months with focus on word production). Prior to entering the Babble Boot Camp, the children in the Very Early and Early groups will receive an alternate treatment focusing on motor skills. Typical infants make up one untreated control group; the second one consists of toddlers and preschoolers born preterm who are too old for the BBC and who will provide once-yearly assessment data. Treatment is implemented by pediatric speech-language pathologists via parent training. Parents learn activities and routines that support typical development, for instance talking to their child frequently right from birth, stimulating and reinforcing vocalizations and babble, shaping first words, and building vocabulary and sentence complexity. Children in all treatment groups and the typical control group are closely monitored from birth to 24 months with longitudinal measures of prespeech, speech, language, and linguistic environment. Measures of quality of life and child development including cognition are also collected to capture any indirect treatment effects. After the intervention ends at child age 2 years, follow-up testing of all outcome domains occurs once yearly until age 4. Using multilevel growth curve models, treatment effects will be evaluated longitudinally and through group comparisons, while also measuring the impact of gestational age and familial factors. Expected results will show that proactive services improve speech and language outcomes, providing objective evidence to change clinical management from deficit-based to proactive services and to consider infants with other risk types. Indirect benefits for cognition and quality of life are possible. This study has potential to enhance health and reduce disease burdens of speech and language disorders. It fits a high NIH funding priority by developing and implementing treatment for intellectual and developmental disorders with the potential of improving quality of life and cognitive and behavioral manifestations.",
FP00012725_Rev1,25,,,,,1,,,"The primary goal of our ongoing R01 is to test whether varenicline is a candidate for switching from prescription-only (Rx) to over-the-counter (OTC), and whether a dose lower than that currently approved is as effective in an OTC environment. Secondary goals include understanding the mechanisms explaining how and when OTC varenicline might improve cessation outcomes, using ecological momentary assessments (EMA) to understand within-person associations in mood, craving, sleep disturbance, and nausea with medication adherence and smoking. Our ongoing R01 is exactly on target with recruitment milestones set at the beginning of the project (Figure 1). As of our most recent annual report (pre-COVID19), we had met our 50% randomization goal of 202 subjects. We will add an additional 27 participants to account for participants who dropped out or who have missing data due to interruption by the COVID19 pandemic. We strongly believe that conclusions from this study could pave the way for significantly increasing smokers access to the most effective cessation medication, and thus have a major impact on tobacco caused morbidity and mortality.Smoking and COVID19. To date, research related to COVID19 and smoking has primarily focused on whether smoking status (including smoking cessation) affects COVID19 infection and severity. While many observational studies suggest that smokers are at increased risk of severe COVID19 infection and poorer outcomes than non-smokers 1-5, there is also evidence that smokers may be a reduced risk of COVID19 infection, perhaps due to the protective effect of nicotine.6 Despite these conflicting results, reviews and opinion pieces have cited smoking cessation as an essential piece of the pandemic response,4,7,8 and both the American Lung Association and the World Health Organization have identified smoking as a risk factor for COVID19-relaed disease and death.9,10 Smoking cessation during a pandemic. As scientists work out the true relationships between smoking and COVID19-related outcomes, smokers are left to negotiate a confusing public information space. Before the COVID19 pandemic, most smokers reported a desire to quit, yet rarely used formal treatment from physicians or cessation programs.11  Instead, most smokers attempted to go cold turkey and most failed numerous times before quitting.12,13 In fact, on any quit attempt, only about 6% of smokers achieve long-term success.14 These facts motivated submission of the parent study. If varenicline can be used safely, our study results could support the argument that the medication should switch to OTC status  which would in turn make it more readily accessible to far more smokers who want to quit, particularly those who will not or cannot go to a healthcare provider. Moreover, because the patent on varenicline will end in 2020, the results of this study was ideally timed to encourage companies to develop generic versions and to pursue the OTC option to increase access and sales. We know very little about how changes to smokers social and physical environment instigated by the COVID19 pandemic have affected smokers intention to quit, access to cessation aids, and actual smoking cessation behavior, and concerns have been raised about whether the COVID19 pandemic will result in increased smoking prevalence.15 In the only published study on this topic to-date, researchers found that Google searches for smoking cessation, nicotine gum, and quit smoking remained unchanged worldwide between January and April 2020.16 In the USA, news outlets report conflicting stories concerning smoking behavior during the pandemic, with some noting that concerns about COVID19 infection have motivated smokers to seek treatment,17 while others note an increase in cigarette sales and a decrease in smoking cessation app downloads.18 Anecdotally, some smokers report that they are facing increased stress, decreasing interest in quitting,19,20 while others note that stay-at-home orders have reduced exposure to friends who smoke, facilitating cessation and preventing relapse.19",

Analysis of genomics data The Bioinformatics team at Mayo has developed workflows to process and visualize genomics results for Low Coverage Whole Genome Sequencing (LC-WGS). LC-WGS assay is mainly used to study Aneuploidy and Copy Number Variants (CNV) events in normal or tumor samples. To be useful, LC-WGS sequencing data have first to be properly processed. The changes of sequencing coverage that informed of the presence of CNV events have to be converted into segments spanning the amplified or deleted regions of the genome. The ASU student will work in close collaboration with Bioinformaticians at Mayo to improve the segmentation algorithm currently used. He will also compare CNVs reported by Oncoscan (a clinical platform used to call CNVs) with results of LC-WGS. Since our preliminary results highlight the potential of LC-WGS to improve CNV calling, we also plan to perform specific studies aiming at associating CNV patterns with tumor grade. This association studies might require the use of machine learning or AI technics.  Analysis of clinical data Dr. Kocher has developed a repository of truly de-identified clinical data that can serve as a base for several studies using machine learning or AI technics to identify patterns associated to disease or disease progressions.

FP00014783_Rev2,30,,,,,1,,,"Accomplishments to Date During our work to date, we have led the development of three main bodies of work regarding waste in the U.S. medical care system:   Non-Clinical Prevention Opportunities and Waste in the U.S. Health Care System: The NAMs widely-cited estimate that the medical care system wastes some $765 billion each year may actually underestimate just how inefficient our medical system is. Excluded from this amount are all non-clinical missed prevention opportunities, including community-based medicine, public medical, and social services. By excluding these prevention opportunities from the discussion, we limit our ability to leverage non-clinical prevention as an approach to reducing medical care waste.  Status: published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine   Scoping Out Colonoscopies: A Different Kind of Waste: Colorectal cancer screening serves as a microcosm of inefficient and inaccessible medical care in the United States. We quantify waste associated with site of service, price, and screening modality. We describe how reallocating wasted resources could yield substantial dividends through expanded access to cancer screening and treatment services.  Status: under review at the Journal of the National Cancer Institute   Excess Medical Care Spending: Categorization, Estimates, and Opportunity Costs: While there is widespread agreement over what waste is, there is no consensus on its magnitude or categories. Systematically reducing wasteful spending will require shared understanding of the magnitude and components of this issue as well as the enormous opportunity costs incurred. This manuscript is the first such attempt to do so, yielding a novel categorization of medical care waste and estimates of the opportunity cost associated with each of the six categories. Status: preliminary findings presented via poster at 2019 AcademyHealth Annual Research Meeting, presented to NAM for consideration as a 2020 Population Health Improvement Roundtable workshop topic (decision TBD), and ready for submission to Health Affairs.  In addition to the submissions above, we have also provided support for analyses developed by other team members by way of regular weekly team calls, manuscript review, and conceptual input. Most notably we have made substantial contributions to manuscripts focused on vaccines, administrative waste, PrEP and combination drugs.  Proposed Next Steps Moving forward, we propose work organized around two overarching aims.   AIM 1: We are specifically proposing to focus on waste related to delivery of services in inappropriate settings, an example of waste given that the same service may cost substantially more depending on where it is performed and by whom. The specific topics are flexible based on mutual interest, we propose to tackle this issue through thorough analyses of (a) specific topic areas or (b) broader, system-level overview, as mutually agreeable:  (A) Specific Topic Areas: o  Site of service waste can occur when a procedure is performed in a higher-cost setting than is clinically necessary. For example, chemotherapy in a hospital versus a freestanding clinic, laboratory testing in a hospital versus a reference lab, or infusion therapy at a clinic versus at home. If mutually agreeable, we propose to examine one or more of these areas, call attention to and, where feasible, quantify associated medical care waste while also proposing solutions to address underlying causes. o  Site of service waste can occur when over-qualified providers are used for relatively simple procedures. For example, an anesthesiologist vs nurse anesthetist, an obstetrician versus a midwife, or an ophthalmologist vs optometrist. If mutually agreeable, we propose to examine one or more of these areas, call attention to and, where feasible, quantify associated medical care waste while also proposing solutions to address underlying causes. o  Viewed in silos, solving issues of waste related to site of service inefficiency may seem daunting. So we propose to demonstrate through careful examination of system-wide impacts of this issue that this a problem large enough to take seriously and that there are viable policy prescriptions that might help solve multiple specific issues, including reference payments, pricing parity, or provider payment reforms, among other options. In this body of work, we will also examine the opportunity costs of site of service-related waste as a call to action. (B)  Broad, system-wide overview:  Deliverables: At least one viewpoint/editorial pieces for submission to mutually agreeable venues germane to the pieces topic and communication message.  AIM 2: To leverage the teams expertise and capitalize on timely opportunities to advance the discussion surrounding waste in the U.S. medical care system, we propose to continue production of topical briefs pertaining to important examples of waste. These briefs will be developed to be responsive to the timely priorities or policy debates surrounding inefficiencies in health care. Topic areas are flexible based on mutual interest and potential for impact. Three illustrative sets of activities are outlined below. Our main intention with this aim is to remain flexible and responsive as specific high-value opportunities arise related to waste in the U.S. medical care system.  First, we have had positive preliminary discussions with the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicines Roundtable on Population Health Improvement. We therefore intend to be prepared for potential collaboration(s) with the Roundtable to plan national convenings on waste-related topics, contribute topical briefs to the Roundtable, or otherwise support their high-impact efforts. In this way we could remain flexible and adaptive to opportunities that arise in order to advance the national discussion regarding medical care system waste (Aim 2). As referenced above, the work performed on the crosswalk of waste analyses has yielded a manuscript nearly ready for submission to a mutually agreed publication venue, beginning first with Health Affairs. We stand ready to offer the Roundtable support in incorporating this line of analysis into their work. Second, we could devote time to quantifying relevant and high-impact examples of medical care waste-related opportunity costs. These estimates could then be disseminated quickly in response to various opportunities. Advance planning to identify a set of alternatives similar to the teams prior Health Dividend work could allow for more opportunistic message dissemination. Third, other time-sensitive examples of upcoming events/opportunities to contribute to the national dialogue around waste include open enrollment season, implications of a government shutdown, or comparing comprehensive health reform plans announced by presidential candidates.  Deliverables: In addition to submission of the crosswalk manuscript, at least two viewpoint/editorial pieces for submission to mutually agreeable venues germane to the pieces topic and communication message.  Work Plan & Production of Deliverables: Given the goal of remaining responsive to timely opportunities, we propose to structure deliverables in two-stages or steps, roughly aligning with the four quarters of the project year:  Sep 2019  Nov 2019 (Q1) Dec 2019  Feb 2020 (Q2) Mar 2020  May 2020 (Q3) Jun 2020  Aug 2020 (Q4) In consultation with team and after review by Dr. Fielding, one topical brief/dissemination piece will be produced for submission to mutually agreeable venue. Given the short timeframe for this quarter, we would anticipate that this piece would surround a mutually agreeable topic related to site of service waste (Aim 1) ASU team proposes or otherwise generates two (2) outlines of potential topical briefs or other dissemination pieces. (Aim 2) In consultation with team and after review by Dr. Fielding, one of the topical briefs/ dissemination pieces outlined during Q2 will be produced for submission to mutually agreeable venue. (Aim 2)  In consultation with team and after review by Dr. Fielding, the second topical briefs/ dissemination pieces outlined during Q2 will be produced for submission to mutually agreeable venue. (Aim 2)    Resources Requested We are submitting a one-year proposal at roughly the same effort and funding levels during previous phases of work. The total amount requested is $[TBD]. We request funding to support Faculty Research Associate Matthew Speer who is committed to the mission and deliverables of the work outlined above. This position works directly with Dr. Mac McCullough to conduct scholarly research, findings synthesis, and resource project management tasks. Dr. McCullough will lead project activities and ensure the completion of this important work. Further detail is provided in the attached budget justification document (to be provided with final version of proposal).   The amount requested is inclusive of salary, fringe benefits, plus an 11% overhead fee for Arizona State University to support management and oversight of funds. A percentage of the funds will be paid to the ASU Foundation in consideration for their services in support of this project.   We share a mutual interest in seeing this proposed body of work effectively disseminated for real-world impact. We have outlined above what we believe to be an aggressive timeline and deliverable production schedule. While we are optimistic in our demonstrated ability to produce meaningful deliverables under initial phases of this work, we propose that funds be delivered in two tranches. The first 50% will be delivered at project outset to ensure sufficient resources to produce the initial dissemination piece and intellectual ideas that will support the second half of the project. The remaining 50% will be delivered at the projects midpoint subject to satisfactory progress towards the projects two aims (i.e., successful submission of at least 1 dissemination piece for publication and generation of 2 outlines of potential topical briefs for completion during the second half of the project).

FP00015769_Res1_Rev1,31,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  Sedentary behaviors (i.e., sitting/lying with low energy expenditure while awake) increase risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, particularly among those who do not engage in recommended levels of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Sedentary screen time (SST; i.e., television viewing and/or video streaming outside of work and educational pursuits) consumes more than half of available discretionary time and is the single most prevalent use of time for Americans outside of work and sleep. Efficacious strategies to reduce sedentary time in other contexts (i.e., workplace) have been developed by our team and others. SST poses far greater health risks than other sedentary pursuits, yet just two intervention studies have exclusively focused on reducing SST. Moreover, the amount and context in which SST is accrued has dramatically shifted since these studies were conducted. Adults (23-64 years of age) only spend half of their SST viewing a traditional television - the other half is spent on mobile streaming platforms (e.g., Netflix) that are likely to promote binge-watching. There is a need for innovative approaches to reduce SST among adults that are responsive to current and emerging technologies. We will leverage our existing theory-driven and empirically-based mHealth platform, which focuses on reducing total sedentary time in adults, to test StandUPTV, an app that will now specifically target SST. The core StandUPTV intervention will include passive and objective self-monitoring of SST and a behavioral target to reduce SST by 50%. Based on our preliminary data and prior research, we have identified three distinct behavioral components that we will add to StandUPTV: (1) electronically prohibiting SST after weekly 50% limit is reached; (2) adaptive text-messaging based on most recent SST bout; and (3) earning 30 min of additional SST with 10 min bout of MVPA. We will use a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to conduct a 16-week factorial experiment to identify which component(s) from the three components under consideration for inclusion in StandUPTV reduce SST by >60 min/day in adults (23-64 years of age) with overweight and obesity. We will also examine how light-intensity physical activity (LPA), MVPA, other factors (e.g., dietary intake), and markers of disease risk (e.g., body weight) change when SST is reduced. We will examine moderators (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity) and mediators of behavior change (i.e., social cognitive constructs). Innovative aspects of this proposal are the use of state-of-the-art mHealth design to design a highly-scalable intervention that is responsive to current trends in media use, the MOST framework to efficiently identify efficacious component(s), and leveraging reductions in SST as opportunities to increase LPA, MVPA, and related health behaviors. This study will directly lead to an optimized intervention  one that is most effective and efficient  to be tested in a longer-term RCT to determine the causal role of SST in lowering chronic disease risk. These findings will produce new targets for health promotion and impact US public health guidelines, which currently do not include explicit recommendations for lowering SST. ",

FP00015769_Res1_Rev3,33,,,,,1,,,"The proposed research supplement will leverage the parent grant, StandUPTV: Reducing Sedentary Screen Time in Adults (R01CA239612), to provide training and enhance the research potential of the candidate, Kristina Hasanaj, and diversifying the biomedical and behavioral medicine workforce in chronic disease and cancer prevention. StandUPTV is a mHealth study that aims to reduce sedentary screen time (SST) in adults with overweight and obesity through the development of an optimized intervention using multiphase optimization strategies (MOST).SST is one the most prevalent discretionary sedentary behaviors (i.e. television viewing and/or video streaming outside of work and educational pursuits).1 Approximately, 80% of American adults engage in SST, for 3.5+ hrs/day, which is over half (55%) of their available discretionary time.2 However, the health risks associated with SST are far greater than in work or other contexts of sedentary behavior.3,4 The amount and context in which SST is accrued has dramatically shifted in recent years, and innovative approaches are needed that are responsive to current and emerging technology in order to successfully reduce SST. Given the prevalence of SST and its deleterious impact on numerous health outcomes, StandUPTV is developing efficacious strategies that are urgently needed to maximize public health impact. The parent grant aims to reduce SST among 240 adults (23-64y) with overweight or obesity who engage in SST >3hrs/day. Existing theory-driven and empirically-based mHealth platforms,5 which currently focus on re-ducing total sedentary time in adults, are being leveraged to specifically target SST. The core intervention in-cludes passive and objective self-monitoring of SST and a behavioral target to reduce SST by 50%. A MOST design will be used to determine which component(s) optimally reduce SST intervention in a 16-week factorial experiment.6 The components are (a) SST electronic lockout or LOCKOUT (which prohibits SST after a week-ly 50% limit is reached); (b) Adaptive prompts or TEXT (adaptive messaging based on most recent SST bout); and (c) Earning SST through moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) or EARN (participants earn 30 minutes of SST per 10 min bout of MVPA).The specific aims of the parent grant are: Primary Aim (parent grant): Develop an optimized intervention for reducing SST by identifying which compo-nent(s) in StandUPTV reduce SST by >60 min/day at 16 weeks. The main effects for each component will be tested (LOCKOUT, TEXT, EARN), as well as all two- and three-way interactions (e.g., TEXT+EARN; LOCK-OUT+EARN+TEXT). Secondary aims (parent grant): To examine how reductions in SST, as a result of StandUPTV components, may impact related health behaviors and outcomes: (a) time displacements into more active behaviors (e.g., housework, walking), activity intensities (i.e., LPA, MVPA), and sleep using device-based measures (ac-tivPAL3c; GENEactiv); (b) dietary intake, snacking, and mood using self-report and ecological momentary as-sessment; and (c) weight and chronic disease biomarkers (e.g., glucose, insulin, and cholesterol); and (d) ex-amine potential intervention moderators (e.g., age strata (23-39y v. 40-64y), sex, race/ethnicity) and mediators (i.e., social cognitive constructs) in line with our conceptual model.The parent project uses a highly innovative and efficient experimental design to identify efficacious components for reducing SST in adults with overweight and obesity. The final product will be an optimized intervention more likely to succeed when tested as a large-scale RCT to determine the longer-term effect of reducing SST on chronic disease risk. Changes in behaviors and risk factors resulting from reductions in SST will be identified, which will lead to new knowledge on why SST is particularly harmful to our health. The findings from StandUPTV will produce new targets for health promotion and influence US public health guidelines, which now broadly reference sitting less7 but do not include specific recommendations for SST reduction. Ms. Hasanaj will be fully immersed in all aspects of the parent grant to provide training and enhance her re-search potential in the field of behavioral medicine and contribute towards diversifying the biomedical work-force. The proposed supplemental activities will support the parent grant by 1) examining the behaviors in the 24-hour day (i.e. sedentary behavior, physical activity, sleep) and the temporal changes resulting from reductions in sedentary SST; and by 2) examining if cardiometabolic health (i.e. weight, body fat%, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose) improvements resulting from reduced SST are mediated by changing behaviors (i.e. diet, activity, sleep). The candidates specific aims are:Aim 1: To examine associations among objectively-measured 24-hour behaviors (i.e. sedentary behavior, physical activity, sleep) and reductions in SST over the 16-week intervention. We hypothesize that behaviors in the 24-hour day are dynamically and temporally related to reductions in SST specific sedentary behaviors over 16-weeks. Aim 2: To examine whether cardiometabolic health (i.e. weight, body fat%, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose) markers are modulated by reductions in SST, and whether these changes are mediated by behavioral mecha-nisms (i.e. diet, activity, sleep) across the 16-week intervention. We hypothesize that reductions in SST will lead to cardiometabolic health improvement over 16 weeks, as a result of behavioral changes. In addition to the aims described above, because Ms. Hasanaj will be immersed in all study activities of the par-ent grant, she will also be exposed to a number of other unique elements of the trial that will enhance her train-ing and potential. StandUPTV will be using MOST methodology to conduct a trial using a 23 factorial screening experiment8 to identify efficacious components (and combinations of components) for reducing SST. This framework is well-accepted for efficiently and systematically developing behavioral interventions in lieu of the traditional RCT approach. Ms. Hasanaj will also receive training in measurement validation procedures for assessment of SST in free-living conditions. These training opportunities, along with the analytical approaches including isotemporal substitution and compositional data analysis that will be used to measure the effect of SST reductions and its impact on other behaviors, will provide experiences to further develop foundational skills and improve the research potential for Ms. Hasanaj.Aim 1 Research Plan: To examine the associations among objectively-measured 24-hour behaviors (i.e. sed-entary behavior, physical activity, sleep) and reductions in SST over the 16-week intervention will be examined. To accomplish this aim, Ms. Hasanaj will receive training in the assessment of 24-hour physical behaviors (sleep, sedentary behavior, and physical activity) and novel design and analytical techniques to examine these associations. Each of these are described below.Assessment of 24-hour physical behaviors: Sedentary screen time (SST) will be measured using the ac-tivPAL3c micro accelerometer (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland) for sedentary posture (i.e., any waking behavior in a seated or reclining posture at low energy expenditure) and the StandUPTV app for screen time. Collected data will be processed into events of sitting/lying, standing, or stepping using the PALbatch soft-ware and specialized R code which Dr. Buman and his team developed. Sleep intervals will be reported using an electronic daily log. All wake time measured by the activPAL as lying/seated will be categorized as seden-tary and then synced with StandUPTV-determined screen time to calculate a final outcome variable of SST (i.e., min/day of both sedentary behavior AND screen time). Binge watching will also be measured as an ex-ploratory outcome, operationally defined as a frequency of >60 min of continuous SST each week.9 Posture and activity intensity will also be assessed using the activPAL3c in min/day. Data will be classified as non-screen sedentary (i.e., sitting/lying without screen time), standing or stepping events. Stepping time will be split into periods of LPA (stepping at <100 steps/minute) and MVPA (stepping at =100 steps/minute).10 Periods of: (a) continuous sitting or standing behavior >6 hr (considered non-wear); (b) days with =10 hours of valid wear time during the wake period; and (c) participants with only one valid day of activPAL wear will be excluded. In seminal work conducted by Dr. Keadle, the activPAL has been shown to be the most valid monitor for detecting sitting time with R2 = .94 and mean bias of -2.8% against direct observation.11 The attachment procedures from several large-scale intervention studies will be followed.1214 Ms. Hasanaj will be exposed to these methods as an integral part of her training, and Drs. Buman and Keadle will work closely with Ms. Hasanaj to ensure she understands the methods as well as how these methods can be used to provide more accurate assessments of sedentary behavior, physical activity, and sedentary screen time.To assess activity type, participants will complete the Activities Completed Over Time in 24 Hours (ACT24), an internet-based previous-day recall that provides critical contextual (i.e., location and purpose) information about behaviors over a 24hr period. Respondents select from 213 individual activities from 13 broad categories (e.g., personal care, leisure and sports, household), record the duration and posture. ACT24 estimates total time (h/day) spent sleeping (in bed), sedentary (sitting or reclining), engaged in physical activity, and energy expendi-ture associated with these behaviors (MET-h/day).1518 This measure has been mapped to time-use categories, which will allow for the assessment of shifts in time-use overall and in response to the StandUPTV intervention (e.g., what sedentary or active behaviors are increased when SST is reduced?).12 ACT24 has been found to be accurate at estimating sedentary time (3% of activPAL), and correlated with light (r=0.34), and moderate-vigorous activity (r=.47) vs. an accelerometer.1 Data captured via the Fitbit Charge 3 will also be leveraged as process-level behavioral data. The primary purpose of the Fitbit is to be a self-monitoring tool, a critical aspect of the intervention. Because the Fitbit-determined posture is less definitive than the activPAL it is not suitable as a primary outcome measure. However, as an exploratory outcome, we will fit behavioral trajectories over the course of the entire 16-week intervention period.19 Assessments of sleep duration and quality will also be collected using the wrist-worn GENEactiv accel-erometer (Activinsights, Kimbolton, UK). Wear protocol will correspond with activPAL wear (i.e., 7 days at each timepoint), and participants will be asked to complete a validated sleep diary each night to separate sleep from wake periods in the actigraphy data.20 The GENEactiv has been well validated for sleep.2124 An open source and validated algorithm will be used to process device-based sleep measures, including sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wakefulness after sleep onset (GGIR package, R-software).24 Dr. Petrov, who is an expert in sleep assessment, will oversee the training of Ms. Hasanaj in these methods. Dr. Buman will assist in this regard, as he currently is overseeing the sleep outcomes in the parent trial.Novel design and analytical techniques: The StandUPTV parent grant presents a unique training opportunity as the trial is designed as a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) design, a highly efficient approach to test the efficacy of multiple behavioral components within the trials. Ms. Hasanaj will be an active participant in the con-duct of this study design, and will view Aim 1 within this framework. Operating within the MOST framework, generalized linear (multiple regression) models will be used to assess whether the application components change SST (min/day), after adjusting for relevant covariates. The general form of the multiple regression model for outcomes will be that of a 2 (LOCKOUT vs. no) x 2 (TEXT vs. no) x 2 (EARN vs. no) ANCOVA, with the baseline (pre-intervention) assessment of the outcome serving as a covariate. Main effects and interaction effects on change will be tested in the outcome from baseline to 8 (interim) and 16 (post) week time points to determine the effective intervention components over the course of the trial. We will also apply other novel ana-lytical techniques to address Aim 1 including isotemporal substitution models25,26 and compositional data analy-sis.26,27 These novel modeling techniques allow more thorough understanding of the impact on health outcomes when shifts from one behavior to another occur (holding time in other behaviors constant). Furthermore, we will use linear mixed effects models with subject-specific random effects similar to our previous work17,28 for measures assessed in a time-intensive manner via accelerometry or EMA (i.e., sleep) so we will be able to ex-amine within-subject relationships with SST over the course of the intervention.",
FP00015961_Rev1,34,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  SARS-CoV-2 is now a global pandemic with 3.2M cases and 234K deaths worldwide (as of May 5, 2020). In the United States, there are over 1.2M cases and 70K deaths. Locally, Arizona has over 9K cases and 400 deaths.  In response to this public health emergency, several studies have been published that describe patient characteristics in terms of signs, symptoms, and clinical endpoints. In addition, epidemiologists and infectious disease researchers have utilized next-generation sequencing technology to produce complete genomes of the virus for clinical and epidemiologic investigation. Genomic epidemiology has enabled scientists to understanding localized transmission while determining geographic sources of introductions from different states and countries. However, most of the sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 (as well as for other viruses) is performed outside of state or local health departments such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), universities, or private labs. It can then be difficult to link the pathogen, once sequenced, back to the data collected by the health department for case investigation. This can inhibit genomic epidemiology when there is no link between sequences of viral isolates and epidemiologic case data. There is limited research in how to link pathogen sequences to epidemiologic case data; especially for COVID-19. Thus, despite the abundance of clinical and epidemiologic data collected during this pandemic, more informatics research is needed to understand how to link viral genetic and epidemiological data and demonstrate the value of this for disease surveillance.  The goal of this supplement is to link epidemiologic data from COVID-19 positive patients in Arizona with viral genetics from sequenced isolates to better understand local transmission dynamics. We will accomplish this by utilizing Arizonas disease surveillance system and available sequences and metadata that are published in online nucleic acid databases. We will use different probabilistic matching strategies to link the two different sources (Aim 1) and then use Bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography to study local transmission dynamics (Aim 2).  Successful completion of these aims will help our understanding of local transmission dynamics. Epidemiologists can use these findings to make inferences about transmission and to identify genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 viruses.  An additional benefit of linking sequences to epidemiologic case data is that it allows scientists to identify the clinical characteristics associated with circulating viruses. While disease severity is dependent on individual immune response and environmental factors, linking viral genetics its proper epidemiologic case could support hypothesis generation for future reverse genetics and immunological studies in animal models.

FP00015961_Rev2,35,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary COVID-19 is expected to become one of the largest mass casualty events in the history of the United States (U.S.). Assessment of the true burden of disease in the population is needed for the prevention and mitigation of this and future viral disease outbreaks. Currently, testing of new cases (via swabs / saliva) and those previously exposed (via serum) has limited reach in the population. However, an alternative approach relying on the analysis of community wastewater can screen up to 70% of the U.S. population on a weekly basis at <0.01% of the cost of clinical screening of individuals. As a population-wide infectious disease surveillance tool, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to complement current surveillance methods to better understand disease burden and how these burdens differ across communities.  The goal of our proposed RADx-rad supplement is to implement and evaluate a near real-time WBE framework for SARS-CoV-2 by (i) assessing in near real-time community spread of the new coronavirus, (ii) significantly increasing the fraction of the U.S. population screened, the frequency at which this testing is being completed (weekly) and the geospatial resolution of screening (from city-wide to neighborhood-specific), (iii) comparing novel coronavirus levels in wastewater with the burdens of infection, disease and mortality reported by local health systems, (iv) harvesting high throughput sequence (HTS) data on SARS-CoV-2 variants across the U.S., (v) optimizing pipelines for HTS analysis, and (vi) immediately sharing any new knowledge gained with the RADx-rad Data Coordinating Center (DCC), research community, and the general public via an expansion of our online dashboard that was pioneered by the proposing team in collaboration with the City of Tempe, AZ. We will leverage previously developed, peer-reviewed strategies for population-wide virus monitoring via reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), HTS, sequence analysis, and data communication originally developed for our parent award to quickly provide a data stream and scientific resource for managing the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. In Aim 1, develop a wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) bioinformatics framework for SARS-CoV-2 at the intra-sewershed or neighborhood-level to produce RT-qPCR and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data for studying the distribution of viral levels and genetic polymorphisms in the community. In Aim 2, we will evaluate a WBE bioinformatics framework for translating SARS-CoV-2 data from RT-qPCR and high-throughput sequencing into information for monitoring population health.  Successful completion of this biomedical informatics project will provide the U.S. with an early warning system for SARS-CoV-2 detection and a tracking aid for public health epidemiologists seeking to reduce morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases like COVID-19 in the U.S.   ",
FP00015982_Rev1,36,,,,,1,,,"This study investigates whether early, proactive intervention improves speech and language outcomes in infants at risk for communication disorders. Speech and language disorders are common and inflict high social, emotional, and educational burdens. Preventive treatments are not available; assessments and treatment areusually not initiated until ages 2 or 3 years when deficits manifest. Infants with classic galactosemia (CG) hold the key towards investigating proactive approaches because they are at high risk not only for motor and cognitive deficits but also for severe speech and language disorders. Because CG is diagnosed via newborn screening, the known risk can be leveraged to evaluate whether proactively supporting the acquisition ofprespeech (2 to 12 months; cooing, babble) and early speech (12 to 24 months; first words, speech sound acquisition, vocabulary growth, sentence complexity) can reduce the communication deficits associated with CG. We designed and launched a proactive speech/language program called Babble Boot Camp (BBC) for infants with CG, ages 2 to 24 months. Initial results are consistent with a beneficial effect on speech and language development, but generalizing from a small pilot cohort is impossible. The proposed study enhances the power, scope, and impact of the BBC by implementing it in a larger CG cohort and evaluating it against control cohorts with and without CG. A pediatric speech-language pathologist implements the program viaparent training. Parents learn about the typical milestones of prespeech, speech, and language development, potential red flags for delays, and importantly, activities and routines that support typical development for allstages of the program, for instance stimulating and reinforcing babble, shaping first words, and buildingvocabulary and sentence complexity. Longitudinal measures of coo, babble, speech, language, and linguisticenvironment using automatized daylong audio recordings in conjunction with signal processing softwaregenerate a rich, objective data matrix. To quantify indirect treatment effects, measures of cognition and qualityof life are also collected. Formal testing of speech, language, cognition, and quality of life outcomes isperformed at 24 months, with follow-up at 36 and 48 months. Using multilevel growth curve models, direct(speech, language) and indirect (cognition, quality of life) treatment effects will be evaluated longitudinally andthrough group comparisons in the three cohorts. Expected results will show that proactive services improve speech and language outcomes, providing objective evidence to change clinical management from deficit-based to proactive services. Indirect benefits for cognition and quality of life are possible. Results will motivate testing proactive approaches in infants with other risk types for speech and language disorders. This study has potential to enhance health and reduce disease burden associated with speech and language disorders. It fits a high NIH funding priority by developing and implementing treatment for intellectual and developmental disorders with the potential of improving quality of life and cognitive and behavioral manifestations.",

FP00016891_Rev1,44,,,,,1,,,"Specific Aims Apolipoproteins  are  a  group  of  proteins  and  glycoproteins  carried  in  lipoprotein  particles  that  have  many functions,  including  modifying  lipoprotein  metabolism.  In  the  brain,  several  apolipoproteins  have  been  found linked with age related dementia, which reflects not just Alzheimers disease, but also vascular contributions to dementia, and other forms of dementia (all referred to henceforth as Alzheimers disease related dementias -ADRD).  Extensive  epidemiological,  clinical,  and  pathological  studies  have  established  links  between  genetic variation in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), especially its ApoE4 isoform, and risk for and severity of ADRD. However, ApoE4 protein levels alone do not fully explain the ADRD risk conferred by the APOE4 gene haplotype. ApoC1 co-localizes with A plaques in brain in AD, while ApoC1 levels are reduced in frontal cortex of patients with AD. APOE4 carriers have significantly lower ApoC1 levels. Recent evidence showed involvement of ApoC3 in A binding and clearance, and association of its lower levels with AD. Apolipoproteins appear in several posttranslational forms (or proteoforms) in both blood and in the brain. Our previous work showed that different proteoforms of  ApoC1, ApoC2 and ApoC3 are associated with functional differences in peripheral lipid metabolism and with cardiovascular events. There are currently no data available on  whether  these  modifications  are  associated  with  changes  in  cognitive  function  and  ADRD  brain  imaging patterns.  As  some  ApoC's  can  cross  the  blood-brain-barrier  (BBB),  and  all  can  interact  with  the  cerebral vasculature,  concentrations in blood may predict the risk and severity of ADRD and other neurodegenerative disorders directly or through their vascular effects, including atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis or cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD).  In our current NIH-funded study we measure total ApoC3, and post-translational proteoforms of apo C1, C2 and C3 in all available plasma samples from baseline (exam 1, 2000-2002) and 10-year follow-up (exam 5, 2010-2012) of the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). The recently initiated multisite study of the vascular contributions to AD (MESA-MIND, n=2,500 participants) affords us a unique opportunity to integrate and relate our ongoing and now proposed measures with objective evidence of cognitive impairment,  and neuroimaging biomarkers  of  ADRD.  We  propose  to  add  total  ApoC1  and  ApoC2  measurements  (exam  1  and  5)  in  all participants of the MESA-MIND ancillary study and to analyze all ApoC data as potential predictors of ADRD. We  will  use  existing  APOE4  haplotype  data,  cognitive  function  data  from  exam  5  and  MESA-MIND  visit  A (collected  at  MESA  exam  7,  2019-2021),  as  well  as  neuroimaging  data  and  overall  clinical  adjudication  of cognitive impairment categories from the ongoing MESA-MIND ancillary study.  Specific  Aim  1:  To  determine  whether  total  apolipoproteins  C1,  C2,  C3  and  their  proteoforms  are associated with cognitive impairment and cognitive decline. We will use MESA exam 1 and exam 5 ApoC measures, and cognitive function data collected at exams 5 and MESA-MIND visit A. This will allow us to examine cross-sectional, prospective and change relationships of  ApoC measures with cognitive function and decline. Importantly,  we  will  also  examine  these  relationships  in  the  context  of  APOE  gene  allele  distribution.  MESA measures  of  subclinical  atherosclerosis,  arteriosclerosis  and  cSVD  will  allow  us  to  explore  potential  vascular links between ApoCs and changes in cognitive function. Specific  Aim  2:  To  determine  whether  total  ApoCs  and  proteoforms  of  ApoCs  are  associated  with neuroimaging biomarkers of ADRD. We will use exam 1 and exam 5 ApoC measures, MESA-MIND visit A brain MRI features (e.g., white matter hyperintensity, cortical thickness of AD signature regions, hippocampal volume), and available A-PET data to test whether baseline or change in ApoC measures predict neuroimaging biomarkers of ADRD and whether this varies by APOE genetic risk alleles or vascular disease.  Leveraging the ongoing assays of MESA ApoC measures with MESA and MESA-MIND data collection makes this supplement project novel, highly efficient, low risk and provides a compelling opportunity to identify early biomarkers, and possibly and modifiable risk factors, of ADRD risk.    Significance: Alzheimers disease (AD), which affects about 5.7 million Americans, is the most common cause of dementia 1. Unfortunately, efforts to find effective treatments for AD and related dementias (ADRD) have yielded only modest benefits.  This is likely related to insufficient understanding of additional key contributors to this complex pathophysiology and the difficulty in reversing longstanding ADRD neurological changes that develop years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify new and early  1 risk markers of ADRD that ideally are also modifiable risk factors that would facilitate intervening at earlier stages of the pathological cascade.  Determinants  of  AD/ADRD:  AD  is  defined  neuropathologically  by  the  presence  of  two  types  of  protein aggregates: extracellular senile plaques, which are composed of the amyloid- (A) peptide, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which are composed of phosphorylated forms of the tau protein. A deposition occurs early  in  AD,  decades  prior  to  clinical  symptoms2.  Although  A  deposition  and  neurofibrillary  tangles  are pathognomonic of AD, there are multiple vascular contributors to AD and ADRD. For example, cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) can initiate neurovascular disorders at the level of the microvascular capillary bed as well as upstream larger vessel disorders including hypertension. Moreover, SVD markers in the retina3,4, kidneys (urinary  albumin  to  creatinine  ratio)5,  small  artery  elasticity  and  cerebral  perfusion  are  associated  with  brain health6. In mixed AD, cSVD is associated with greater A deposition7, and the latter is associated with higher midlife blood pressure, ante-mortem pulse pressure8, lipid metabolism and a greater CVD burden9-11. Subclinical biomarkers  of  atherosclerosis  (e.g.,  coronary  artery  calcification,  carotid  intima-media  thickness,  and  ankle brachial  index)  have  been  related  to  stroke,  brain  atrophy  and  cognitive  decline12.  Arteriosclerosis,  with functional and structural hardening of the arteries, is a key mechanism by which vascular changes directly lead to hemodynamic changes in the brain. Arterial stiffness is an age-related phenomenon 13,14 accelerated by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension13,15-17, cardiovascular events18 and alters cerebral blood perfusion19. Previous studies linked arterial stiffness to cognitive decline20-22 and impairment21,23, A deposition24,25, cSVD26 and brain atrophy23. Many of these subclinical vascular contributors to ADRD are carefully studied in the MESA-MIND ancillary study and allow us to examine their link with ApoC measures. Apolipoproteins in vascular disease and ADRD: Apolipoproteins (Apo) are a group of proteins and glycoproteins associated with triglycerides and cholesterol in lipoprotein particles that are essential for regulation of blood lipid metabolism. Many may also modulate inflammation, thrombosis and/or endothelial function27,28 and are linked with vascular injury and CVD29-33. In the brain, lipoprotein-derived molecules are critical for neuronal plasticity and many important brain functions34. Brain cells express numerous receptors (e.g, APOER2, MEGF7, VLDLR, LRP1 and LRP2  35) that bind to various receptor-binding domains of  Apos to help specify the lipoprotein and nature of lipid that should be transported to and from a specific cell. It is not surprising therefore that abnormalities in  Apo  levels  and  function  are  associated  with  neurodegenerative  processes,  including  ADRD36,37.  Extensive epidemiological,  clinical,  and  pathological  studies  have  indeed  established  a  close  link  between  the  human APOE gene, and the risk and clinical outcomes of several neurodegenerative diseases  38, including hereditary and sporadic AD types 38-44. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is primarily synthesized in the liver but is produced also in the  brain39.  As  ApoE  cannot  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB),  ApoE  in  CNS  is  entirely  of  brain  origin.  In humans, ApoE is expressed in three isoforms, ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, encoded by the alleles 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The ApoE4 isoform seems to have the greatest pathological importance for ADRD39,40, and is associated with accelerated aggregation of amyloid- (A) in the brain45. As multiple other Apos are carried in the same lipoproteins as ApoE and can therefore modulate both ApoE and lipoprotein interaction with neuronal cells, there is increasing recognition that other Apos may be linked to ADRD either independently or through interactions with ApoE.  Likely Apo candidates to modulate ApoE activity on development of AD include ApoCs. APOC1 gene variants for AD are in proximity to the APOE locus46 and have been proposed as a significant risk factors for AD47. ApoC1 is a small 6.6 kD apolipoprotein constituent of HDL that is known to inhibit receptor-mediated clearance of ApoE containing lipoproteins. As with other plasma ApoC's within HDL, ApoC1 can cross the BBB48. ApoC1 co-localizes with A plaques in brain in AD, while ApoC1 levels are reduced in frontal cortex of  patients  with  AD.  ApoC1  in  humans  vary  with  APOE  genotype,  with  4  carriers  showing  significantly  less ApoC1.  As  ApoC1  potently  reduces  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  secretion  from  primary  murine  microglia  and astrocytes,  and  human  macrophages  stimulated  with  LPS  or    A47,  this  further  supports  a  link  between  low ApoC1 and ADRD. Although APOC2 genes are a part of the same gene complex with APOC1 and APOE, its regulation and possible role in the CNS and neurodegenerative disease is understudied and poorly understood35.  While  ApoC1  or  ApoC2  show  genetic  linkage  with  ApoE,  APOC3  is  linked  with  two  other  lipoprotein  genes APOA1 and APOA4, sharing a common gene cluster on chromosome 11. The expression of all three genes and the  corresponding  Apos  are  altered  in  patients  with  AD49.  In  plasma,  ApoC3  is  a  major  protein  moiety  of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins50, contributing to delayed clearance of these lipoproteins by inhibition of lipoprotein lipolysis, and of uptake by various receptors including ApoE/LDL receptors, and stimulation of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production51-55. In mice exposed to a high-fat diet, overexpression of human APOC3 facilitates development  of  atherosclerosis56.  Treatments  that  lower  ApoC3  levels  in  animal  studies  have  also  shown 2  reduced dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis32,57-59. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in APOC3 are associated with decreases in coronary artery calcification60 while higher ApoC3 concentrations on lipoproteins or in plasma are associated with augmented atherosclerosis progression61,62 and risk of incident CVD62-64.  Role of posttranslational ApoC modifications in AD. While nearly all studies of apolipoproteins in ADRD have focused on total plasma levels, in circulation, ApoCs exist in several posttranslational variants. ApoC1 occurs as full-length and truncated (ApoC1) proteoform, lacking the two N-terminal amino acids, threonine and proline 65,66. The ApoC1 truncation is catalyzed by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), a widely distributed serine protease with many  known  substrates,  including  cytokines,  chemokines,  growth  factors,  and  neuropeptides67.  It  has  been shown that higher DPP-4 activity in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with decline in cognitive function 68. The functional consequences of ApoC1 truncation are mostly unknown. ApoC2 circulates as native pre-ApoC2 and the mature truncated  ApoC2,  lacking N-terminal terminal hexapeptide66. In blood,  truncated ApoC2 co-activates lipoprotein lipase and modulates HDL metabolism69. Whether truncation of native  ApoC2 differs  in this  effect  and how  this  could  influence  vascular  disease  or  neurodegenerative  conditions  is  largely unknown. ApoC3 occurs in four major proteoforms, including native protein (ApoC30a), glycated but asialylated (ApoC30b), monosialylated  (ApoC31)  and  disialylated  (ApoC32)  proteoforms.  There  are  significant  functional  differences between these proteoforms in regulating triglyceride clearance in vitro70. In vivo they are differentially modulated by diet or diabetes medications71,72, and appear to have distinctly different relationships with blood lipids and by race73-75. In fact, African Americans are a group at  higher risk for ADRD76,77, and had the highest disialylated ApoC3  (ApoC32) levels  in  our  previous  study78.  Moreover,  in  the  same  study,  age  was  one  of  the  strongest determinants of ApoC3 proteoform distribution (and greater sialylation)78. Interestingly, total ApoC3 was lower in both African Americans and older individuals (yet both have higher relative sialylation), pointing out a potential discrepancy between total levels of ApoC3 and its isoforms in potential ADRD risk. Consistent with this, plasma levels of  total  ApoC3 appear reduced in patients with AD and  asymptomatic individuals  with family history of AD79. As ApoC3 was also shown to bind A and enhance A clearance79, its possible that sialylation of ApoC3 and other Apos, including ApoE may influence this process as well as lipoprotein binding, cholesterol transfer, aggregation  and  fibril  formation80-85.  In  preliminary  analyses  (below),  we  demonstrated  a  remarkably  strong relationship between proteoforms of ApoC3 in plasma and CSF, highlighting that simple plasma measures may provide  important  insight  into  ongoing  events  in  the  brain.  Preliminary  data  also  show  ApoC3  sialylation  is increased  in those  with  APOE4  alleles. Thus,  although  less  studied  in the  context  of AD  than  ApoE, there  is support  for  the  notion  that  ApoC3  may  modulate  A  accumulation  and  that  plasma  levels  of  ApoC3  and  its sialylation alter risk for ADRD79.   The  2018  NIA-Alzheimer's  Association  research  framework  for  AD86  focuses  on  the  diagnosis  of  AD  with biomarkers  (aggregated  A  and  Tau,  and  neurodegenerative  changes)  and  sees  ADRD  as  a  pathology continuum, which is a useful construct for observational studies such as MESA and trials. However, there are a number  of  cognitive  assessments  that  permit  more  refined  classification  of  syndrome  categories  such  as cognitively unimpaired, mildly impaired, and dementia or as a continuum of cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive tests typically  provide  a  more  functional  assessment  of  memory  and  other  executive  functions  and  reflect  more clinically apparent disease rather than underlying pathology. Numerous cognitive tests are available, but those used  in  the  MESA  exams  Cognitive  Abilities  Screening Instrument (CASI),  Digit  Symbol  Coding  (DSC),  Digit Span (DS, forward and backward) are reliable and efficiently conducted in large cohorts87,88.  The more extensive uniform data set (UDS) battery of tests are comprehensive assessments of cognitive function and can be readily adjudicated for clinical diagnoses of cognitive impairment and dementia. Brain MRI imaging provides excellent indications  of  neurodegeneration  as  expressed  by  white  matter  hyperintensity  (WMH),  lower  hippocampal volume,  reduced  cortical  thickness,  and  loss  of  cerebral  volume.    Focally  reduced  uptake  of  glucose  and increased accumulation of A on PET scans are highly correlated with extent and future AD89. These provide both  anatomical  and  functional  assessments  of  the  brain  that  provide  complementary  early  indications  of neurodegeneration. Leveraging MESA-MIND's cognitive function and brain assessments and MESA's repeated vascular  studies  allows  us  to  provide  a  relatively  comprehensive  assessment  of  ApoCs  direct  and/or  indirect effects on ADRD. Overall, there appear striking links between ApoCs and ApoE in gene locations, presence in lipoproteins, roles in  lipid  metabolism  and  vascular  disease,  interactions/colocalizations  with  A,  and  possible  connections  to ADRD. The real possibility that posttranslational modifications of these apolipoproteins may further modify their  3 functional roles in metabolism and potentially ADRD further highlights the need to comprehensively study these apolipoproteins and their relationships with biomarkers of early neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.  Innovation and Impact: Using innovative technology and leveraging the unique measures and large diverse cohort of MESA to test for novel biomarkers of ADRD, the current proposal provides the first comprehensive assessment of total and posttranslational modifications of ApoC1-3 in relationship to ADRD. Moreover, this study may  also  provide  insight  into  potential  interactions  between  ApoCs  and  ApoEs,  potentially  improving  both disease prediction and our understanding of ADRD pathogenesis. Given the high fidelity and high throughput nature  of the  posttranslational  ApoC measures,  these  relationships  can  be  readily  validated  in  other  cohorts, providing an excellent platform for expansion of this work. If these ApoC measures are indeed related to ADRD, thus providing further evidence of the link between apolipoproteins and neurodegenerative diseases, this work may also stimulate examination of this link in other conditions such as Parkinsons disease.  Plasma levels of ApoCs  and  relative  amounts  of  proteoforms  differ  in  groups  at  high  risk  for  ADRD  (e.g.,  African  Americans, elderly, diabetes); thus, there is potential that alterations in these ApoCs may help explain differential risk across these groups.  Therefore, this project also addresses key objectives of the National Alzheimers Project Act 1 by providing  information  that  may  account  for  the  high  burden  of  AD  among  African  Americans  and  Hispanics. Importantly, ApoCs in plasma, and potentially by extension in CSF, appear eminently modifiable. Drugs such as Volanesorsen are well along in pharmaceutical development and can have profound effects on total ApoC3 and its proteoforms59,90. We and others have also shown certain diets, glucose lowering and several medications in current use appear associated with shifts in several ApoC proteoforms that could be useful for clinical testing and translation. Research  Strategy:  The  goal  of  the  current  supplement  proposal  is  to  investigate  the  cross-sectional, prospective  and  change  relationships  between  total  ApoC1,  ApoC2  and  ApoC3  concentrations  and  post-translational proteoforms in plasma and cognitive function, and neuroimaging signs of ADRD dementia in MESA and the ancillary MESA-MIND study. We will also explore potential mechanisms underlying these relationships by  determining  whether  vascular  changes  may  precede  or  parallel  these  changes  in  biomarkers  of  ADRD. Although  Drs.  Reaven  and  Koska  will  lead  this  apolipoprotein focused  project,  they  will  work  closely  with  Dr. Timothy Hughes, the PI of the MESA-MIND (see letter of support) and his team to ensure smooth integration and appropriate analysis and interpretation of these data.  This proposal reflects the intent of the current NIH supplement RFA, which is to bring novel research ideas and measurements from other medical areas to the field of ADRD. We describe below the data to be merged with our ApoC measures for analysis.  Existing  Resources:  The  MESA  study  is  an  ongoing  population-based  study  of  the  characteristics  of subclinical  cardiovascular  disease  and  risk  factors  that  predict  progression  to  clinically  overt  cardiovascular disease in a diverse sample of 6,814 men and women aged 45-84 recruited from six Field Centers in 2000-2002. Selected repetition of subclinical vascular disease measures and risk factors allows study of the progression of atherosclerotic disease. The last examination (Exam 6) took place in 2016-2018. Blood samples were assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. Genomic studies included ApoE isoforms estimated  from  SNPs  rs429358  and  rs7412  from  the  genotyping  conducted  in  MESA  participants  in  201376. ApoE4 haplotype was present in about 25% of MESA participants  assessed for cognitive function at Exam 5 (2010-2012)76. At exam 5 (2010-2012, i.e. ~10 years of follow-up), 4,591 MESA participants underwent a brief cognitive assessment including the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), Digit Symbol Coding test (DSC) and Digit Span (DS)76. CASI is a validated measure of global cognition that is purportedly less influenced by cultural factors. It represents nine cognitive domains including attention, concentration, orientation, short-term memory;  long-term  memory,  language,  visual  construction,  verbal  fluency  and  abstraction/judgment  (overall score range of 0-100). DSC (score 0-133) and DS (score 0-28) assess specific perceptual and mental operations dependent on memory, reasoning and other cognitive abilities.   MESA-MIND: We will leverage cognitive and neuroimaging data from the ongoing ancillary MESA-MIND study (R01  AG058969).  Visit  A  includes  2,500  MESA  participants  completing  exam  7  (2019-2021)  with  a  brief cognitive assessment (CASI, DSC and DS) and more detailed testing using the Uniform Data Set version 3 (UDS v3). Brain MRI data includes measures of brain volume, WMH, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and evaluation of cerebral microbleeds and cortical microinfarcts. A-PET scan will be available from a subset 1,500 participants. A deposition is quantified by [11C]PiB uptake visualized by PET using standardized uptake volume ratio  (SUVR).  The  UDSv3,  together  with  clinical  and  neuroimaging  data  is  used  for  adjudication  of  cognitive function categories (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia) by the expert adjudication committee. NIA-Alzheimers Association criteria are used to identify those on the AD continuum. 4  Specific grant supplement plans. We aim to utilize existing plasma ApoCs proteoform measurements from our current NIH funded study on the relationship of ApoCs proteoforms with progression of atherosclerosis and future CVD events. As part of this study, we use a high throughput Mass Spectrometry Immunoassay to measure major ApoC1, ApoC2 and ApoC3 proteoforms at MESA exam 1 and MESA exam 5. Because of its known relevance to CVD, we also measure total ApoC3 in these same samples. In contrast, total ApoC1 and ApoC2 is currently measured only in a small case-cohort subset (n~600) to explore their role for atherosclerosis and CVD outcomes. To fulfill the goals of the present supplement we propose to add total ApoC1 and ApoC2 measurements in all available  baseline  and  exam  5  samples  of  MESA  participants  with  exam  5  cognitive  function  assessment (n~9,000 total samples). We will then merge all our ApoC measures with the cognitive function, neuroimaging biomarker data, APOE genetic data and adjudicated dementia category data being collected as part of MESA-MIND  study  to  comprehensively  examine  the  relationships  of  these  ApoC  measures  with  these  functional, structural and diagnostic measures of the cognitive continuum and ADRD. We will also use the well-defined and described serial measures of arterial stiffness, carotid intimal thickness and coronary artery calcium to examine if vascular disease may be a mechanistic pathway by which ApoCs influence development of ADRD. Preliminary data supporting the proposal: Recently we have completed analyses of total plasma ApoC3 and ApoC1, and their proteoforms in 1,740 participants of the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial. We have found a strong positive association of  ApoC32  levels  with age (r=0.21, p<0.0001). African Americans  had significantly higher ApoC32,  which  was  not  explained  by  plasma  lipids  (p=0.008).  In  contrast,  total  ApoC3  was  lower  in  African Americans  and  was  negatively  associated  with  age  (r=-0.10, p<0.0001). Importantly, higher ApoC32 was also associated with African American race and older age in our previous study in 531 non-diabetic  individuals  of  diverse  race/ethnicity78.  In  the  same cohort, we observed an inverse association between age and full length  ApoC1  (r=-0.09,  p<0.05;  opposite  of  that  with  truncated ApoC1).  These  data  indicate  distinctly  different  associations  of ApoC3 (and ApoC1) proteoforms versus total ApoCs levels with two well-known determinants of ADRD.   Previous  studies  have  reported  concordance  between  total ApoCs levels in plasma and CSF48. We now find a very strong association between all ApoC3 proteoforms in paired plasma and CSF  samples  from  healthy  individuals  with  and  without  family history of AD (Figure 1, ApoC32 shown as example), indicating that  plasma  proteoform  distribution  is  highly  representative  of their  brain  levels  and  could  influence,  or  relate  to,  cognitive function and changes in brain morphology.  In  the  630  MESA  participants  currently  with  measured  ApoC3 proteoform data from our current grant, ApoC32 at exam 1 already shows an inverse association with exam 5 CASI score 10-years later (=-0.14,  p=0.03)  after  adjustment  for  age,  sex,  race,  education level and plasma lipids. This was as strong as the CASI association with  age  (=-0.15  per  1  year).  Of  note,  plasma  ApoC32  was  also higher while ApoC31 was lower in APOE4 allele carriers (p<0.01 both, Table 1), suggesting a potential interaction and additional risk for APOE4 carriers. General approach and biostatistical considerations for proposed study analyses:  Descriptive statistics and graphic tools will be used to examine the distribution of continuous variables followed by appropriate transformations, if necessary. The main exposure will be total plasma concentrations, and ApoC1, ApoC2 and ApoC3 proteoforms, expressed as relative peak areas to total peak area. The secondary exposure measure  will  be  absolute  concentrations  of  individual  proteoform  derived  from  total  ApoCs  and  relative  peak areas.  A staged mixed linear model approach will be used to analyze the continuous outcomes such as cognitive testing and MRI imaging read-outs. Models will include ApoC measures at exam 1 and exam 5 separately as respective long-term and short to mid-term predictors of study outcomes. We will also include them in the same model to test the effect of their 10-year change. The basic model will be adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, plasma lipids E4+ (n=156)  0.07 E4- (n=484)  0.08 Table 1: Mean relative peak areas of ApoC3 proteoforms  by  presence  of  APOE4. *p<0.01 Figure 1.

In the next stage we will include APOE haplotype. The models will include the interaction term to test for potential modifying effect of APOE haplotype.  Involvement of vascular pathology in the ApoCs effects on cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes will be tested by including in the models measures of vascular health as defined in MESA-MIND, respectively: (1) a subclinical atherosclerotic  CVD  risk  composite  score  (subASCVD)  derived  from  coronary  calcium,  carotid  intima-media thickness  and  ankle-brachial  index  at  exams  1  to  6;  (2)  Aortic  pulse  wave  velocity  as  primary  measure  of arteriosclerosis at exams 1 and 5; (3) SVD, a composite from retinal hemorrhages and vessel caliber, urinary albumin to creatinine, ratio, small artery elasticity available at exam 2 (2002-2004).  The models may be further expanded to assess the impact of other potential covariates such as medications for hypertension and diabetes and total intracranial volume (for MRI volumes). Mixed models will provide the ability to evaluate associations concerning subject level factors (fixed effects) while accommodating non-independence of longitudinal measurements for individual subjects or study sites (random effects). Similar modeling strategies will be adopted for binary outcomes (e.g., A+ scans, high WMH on MRI, presence of MCI and/or dementia) using logistic regression models. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. As risk for ADRD significantly differs between racial groups77 and our preliminary data show significant differences in several ApoC measures between races/ethnicities, in secondary analyses we will test whether racial differences in cognitive and neuroimaging measures could be explained in part by variability in ApoC measures. We will also leverage the longitudinal data collected in MESA over 18 years and evaluate the association between change in ApoC measures and various ADRD biomarkers. Unstructured variance-covariance structure will be used to account for the correlations among the repeated measures. Some measures will have more than 2 repeated measures collected  in  multiple  MESA  exams.  For  incident  MCI  and  dementia,  we  will  fit  Poisson  regression  models  to account  for  different  lengths  of  follow-up.  If  there  is  evidence  of  over  dispersion,  we  will  consider  negative binomial models instead. Study endpoints and statistical power: For Specific Aim 1, CASI will be used as the primary outcome followed by  DCS  and  DS  as  supportive  secondary  outcomes.  Cognitive  impairment  categories  at  MESA-MIND  visit  A (normal, MCI and dementia) will be the primary outcome for testing the association between the ApoC measures 78  and  SD=11  for  CASI76,  the  minimum and  clinical  syndromes.  Assuming  a  SD  of  5%  for  relative  ApoC32detectable  difference  in CASI  per  unit change  in  ApoC32  is  0.09 for  n=4,500  (Exam  5)  and  0.12 for  n=2,500 (MESA-MIND visit A) at 80% power and alpha=0.05.  This are even less than our preliminary  -estimates for apoC32 and CASI (=-0.14,noted above).  For cognitive impairment categories, 25% are expected to develop MCI (i.e. n~625) and 3% dementia (n~75) at MESA-MIND visit A, providing power to detect odds ratios of 1.27 and 2.0 respectively for a 1 SD change in ApoC measures.  For Specific Aim 2, the endpoints will be (a) A+ scans (SUVR>1.5); (b) sCVD (WMH>median); (c) cortical volume in AD prone regions (continuous) and (d) rCBF (continuous). At 80% power and alpha=0.05, the minimum detectable ORs for a 1 SD change in the exposure variables are as follows:  A+ (estimated at 50%, n=1,500), OR=1.23; and (b) sCVD, OR=1.19; and for a 1% change in ApoC32 the minimum detectable differences are 0.14 ml/100g/min in rCBF (assuming SD=12)91 and 10 mm3 in total hippocampal volume (assuming SD=900)92 (n=2,500). These minimal detectable changes are comparable to that of a single year increase in age (associated with 0.20 ml/100g/min decrease in rCBF93 and 6 mm3 reduction in right hippocampal volume94), indicating good power for detection of clinically relevant changes.  Study in  MESA  or  MESA-MIND,  neuropathology diagnoses are limited to the AD continuum. Although this still provides quite valuable disease classification,  there  are  ongoing  efforts  within  MESA  to  add  Tau  assessments  to  further  refine  diagnoses.  Although  the  study  aims  are  largely  associational  in  nature,  the  ability  to  examine  prospective  and  change relationships increases the potential of these ApoC measures as both risk markers and risk factors. Moreover, the ability to examine whether ApoC measures relate to ADRD directly or via vascular disease provides relevant mechanistic insight into their actions.  Despite high concordance between plasma and CSF in total ApoCs and their proteoform levels, absolute levels and the effect thresholds  may differ between  brain and the periphery. This also emphasizes the importance of measuring total ApoC levels as proposed to allow determination of not just relative proteoform",
FP00016891_Rev2,45,,,,,1,,,"Abstract Apolipoprotein  C-III  (apoC-III)  is  increasingly  recognized  as  an  important  determinant  of  dyslipidemia  and cardiovascular risk.  Although apoC-III is typically measured as total plasma apoC-III concentration, it is present in blood in several post-translational proteoforms - with the most abundant forms containing zero, one  or  two  sialic  acid  molecules.  However,  the  relationships  between  apoC-III  proteoforms  and  patterns  of dyslipidemia,  atherosclerosis  and  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  risk  are  largely  unknown.    We  found  that higher relative amounts of apoC-III with two sialic acids (but not 0 or 1) were linked in cross-sectional and prospective studies with lower triglyceride levels, and were associated with reduced risk for CVD events.  Our data also indicate ratios of these proteoforms may vary with race and lipid-lowering therapies and that proteoforms of both apoC-I and C-II also demonstrate unique relationships with blood lipid concentrations. The  Multi-Ethnic  Study  of  Atherosclerosis  (MESA)  is  a  large  community  based  cohort  study  of  CVD  risk factors,  subclinical  measures  of  atherosclerosis  and  determinants  of  major  CVD  events.    Importantly,  the diverse ethnic and racial population within the study will permit a definitive study of these proteoforms and their relationships with lipid abnormalities, atherosclerosis and CVD events while exploring ethnic/racial differences. The  present  proposal  will  utilize  a  novel  mass  spectrometry  immunoassay  (MSIA)  to  investigate  the relationships  of  apoC-III  (and  secondarily  apo-CI  and  C-II)  proteoforms  with  plasma  lipid  concentrations, progression  of  vascular  calcification  and  carotid  atherosclerosis,  and  development  of  major  adverse cardiovascular  events  (MACE)  within  the  MESA  cohort.  Total  plasma  apoC-III  concentrations  and  apoC-III relative proteoform amounts will be determined by MSIA in baseline and 10-year follow-up plasma samples.  Aim 1 will examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between apoC-III measures and plasma lipids.  Aim 2  will  determine  whether  apoC-III measures  predict  baseline atherosclerosis  and  atherosclerosis progression evaluated from CT scans of coronary arteries and ultrasonography-derived carotid-intima-media thickness  measured  during  MESA.  Aim  3  will  determine  the  relationship  between  apoC-III  measures  and incident MACE and total CVD events. This will be the first large study evaluating relationships between apoC proteoforms and CVD risk. As therapies are now being developed to specifically target apoC proteins to reduce triglycerides and CVD risk, a more  definitive  understanding  of  the  complexity  and  clinical  implications  of  the  apoC  family  of  proteins  is needed.    As  diabetes  and  lipid-lowering  therapies  appear  to  have  differential  effects  on  apoC  proteoforms, targeting  therapy  to  specific  proteoforms  and/or  subsets  of  individuals  may  be  beneficial.    As  we  have demonstrated that there are proteoforms of many other plasma proteins, this study may also help highlight the broader value of identifying variations in post-translational protein structure and their functional differences.

The study includes all actively practicing physicians in Arizona with a special focus on physicians serving AHCCCS members. The survey questions follow the required questions asked of physicians at the time of licensure application.  Respondents would include physicians applying for new licenses in the state, those engaging in the 2-year renewal process, and those in residencies.  Background CHiR has conducted ongoing collection of licensing data on all allopathic and osteopathic physicians who hold Arizona licenses since 1991 through partnerships with the Arizona Medical Board and the Board of Osteopathic Examiners.  The licensing information is augmented by survey questions that are included in the licensing application process.  Current Data Our current database includes individual records on more than 17,500 physicians who renewed their Arizona licenses during the period, plus data for previous years beginning in 2007-2009 (not all practicing in Arizona). Electronic survey questions have replaced paper survey instruments, leaving some comparable data across all years for selected long-term trends. CHiR also maintains a statewide Medicaid repository that is capable of identifying physicians who actively treat AHCCCS members. Renewal Cycle Allopathic physicians renew their licenses every two years on their birthdays.  Osteopathic physicians renew their licenses every other year over a period of several months, generally November through January, with an extension period through April. Their 2017-2019 renewal cycle ended in April 2019.    Page 2 of 11 Tasks/Workload Data Management/Physician Surveillance   CHiR will continue to coordinate with the licensing boards to collect survey responses in conjunction with applications for licensure (includes non-respondents to the survey).   A revised survey instrument was deployed in March 2019. CHiR will work through the Arizona Medical Board to conduct interim checks of data capturing and correct any issues in a timely manner.   CHiR will merge the survey response data with additional available information (i.e. physician demographics, other) to facilitate reporting. o  The focus on physicians who treat AHCCCS members will continue.  Deliverables   CHiR will provide AHCCCS with a draft and final report for the period March 2019-March 2020 that describes physician positions on health information technology with an extensive focus on AHCCCS providers.  Findings will be used to inform AHCCCS efforts toward advancing health information technology among providers.  Selected references to results from previous years that are comparable to the current survey instrument will also be included in the report.  To the extent that results are supported by the available data, the reports will include the following minimum information: o  Number and characteristics of the physicians who renewed their licenses or applied for a new license during the above time periods and non-respondent implications.   o  Comparisons of physicians using electronic health records versus physicians not using electronic health records.  o  Comparisons of AHCCCS providers to non-AHCCCS providers will be made on all relevant characteristics: demographics; experience in using the Arizona Medicaid Promoting Interoperability Program; electronic exchange of information and the nature of existing obstacles to electronic exchanges; and examination of the specific effects of EMR use.

Anita Murcko, Clinical Associate Professor, Biomedical Informatics, ASU4. Aniket Majumdar, Data Scientist, Galvanize Inc.This pre-proposal is being submitted to AHCCCS for consideration in their response to the SAMHSA-SOR grantproposal. ASU oers a multidisciplinary team comprised of data scientists, computer scientists and physicians withexpertise in informatics, managed care and quality to assist combating the opioid epidemic in Arizona. We oertwo tasks to be accomplished over two years. Task 1 will focus on data analysis, whereas task 2 will focus on amobile application development. The details of these tasks are outlined below.Task 1: Agent-based and Dynamic Modeling of Opioid Use Disorder(OUD) and Medication AssistedTreatment(MAT): The objective of this task is to leverage the data science expertise at ASU, specically inmodeling and analysis to generate dynamical, time-lapsed models, employing diverse data (such as AHCCCS claims,ADHS data, etc.) to:as manifested in a simulation study Explore the evolution of OUD as a dynamical system and the impact of local MAT on OUD Identify critical gaps in treatment availability pertaining to, geographic, demographic, and service levels terms, Employ what-if scenarios to quantify the impact of interventions in the full system.The planned models will consider data on individuals (such as age, ethnicity, opioid use, services, geography,etc.), service provider data (such as facilities, specialty services, location, medication stocking, rst responders,MAT, etc.), and additional data related to economic, housing, behavioral risk factor surveillance etc. The dynamicmodel is updated in discrete time steps and provides resources and prevalence assessments. The deliverable isan operational model for use by AHCCCS and other state agencies to quantify the impact of decision makingalternatives pertinent to OUD.Proposed timeline- 0 - 4 months: Data collection, cleaning, introductory data analysis 4 - 10 months: Agent Based Model development 10 - 16 months: Dynamical time lapse model development 16 - 24 months: Simulation and model validationTask 2:iOS and Android Application: ODMAP is a mobile application designed to support public healtheorts to mobilize an immediate response to an overdose spike. It links rst responders to a mapping tool thattracks overdoses to simulate real-time response and strategic analysis across jurisdictions. The interface of ODMAPapplication can be seen in the gure. This application is extensively used in Washington DC and the Baltimorearea, and has turned out to be a very useful tool for combating the epidemic. As a part of this eort, we plan tobuild an ODMAP like application (AZMAP) with enhanced capabilities. AZMAP will have the capabilities at twolevels, to provide services to (i) individuals requiring immediate service and (ii) rst responders, as elaborated below Level 1: The target users for this level are individuals requiring imme-diate aid, such as seeking the nearest MAT center, prescription drop osites, etc. The application will contain key updated information such as,(i) resource centers, (ii) hours of operation, (iii) availability of medicalpersonnel, (iv) average wait time, (v) availability of naloxone, etc. Theapplication will suggest the nearest resource, based on the parameters de-scribed above. The application will also contain an SOS alert buttonto connect to emergent aid, such as the local 911 operator. Level 2: This level is targeted to First Responders. They will access a map(of their jurisdiction) to monitor opiate related incidences in real time, toassist with provision of timely, targeted services.Proposed timeline 0-8 months: Developing Level 1 application (Version 1) 8-16 months: Developing Level 2 application (Version 2) 16-24 months: Testing and debugging applicationCost Estimate: $250,000 per year for two years.Additional Information: The ASU team is currently engaged with ocialsand service providers in Maricopa County and the City of Tempe on opioid epidemic related data analysis.

FP00017538_Res1,51,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  Project Title: The role of selective attention in speech comprehension  The inability to understand speech severely impairs communication, drastically reducing an individuals quality of life and self-sufficiency. Over two million Americans have clinically diagnosed language impairments (aphasia) due to stroke, and many additional stroke survivors are not diagnosed with aphasia but still experience speech comprehension difficulties that affect their daily lives. Individuals who have experienced a stroke frequently have difficulties with speech comprehension, particularly in degraded or complex situations, yet auditory comprehension deficits due to stroke are poorly understood and understudied. There is mounting evidence that executive functions (such as selective attention, working memory and task-switching) contribute to successful speech comprehension recovery, but the critical cognitive mechanisms and precise brain networks remain unclear. Selective attention has been identified as a critical precursor for these other executive functions, and therefore is a particularly worthy target of investigation. The current project will examine the contributions of selective attention to speech comprehension in difficult, typical listening environments (e.g. multiple speakers in a noisy restaurant) in stroke survivors. Individuals who have experienced a left hemisphere stroke and matched neurotypical control participants will complete a series of behavioral measures of selective attention and speech comprehension in addition to resting-state functional MRI and structural MRI protocols. The project has three specific aims: (1) Identify the relationship between selective attention and speech comprehension abilities after stroke, (2) Identify the selective attention brain networks that contribute to speech comprehension in healthy adults, and (3) identify how selective attention brain networks support speech comprehension after stroke. The long-term objective is to identify specific cognitive, neural, and behavioral targets by which to optimize post-stroke language recovery and communication. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The inability to understand speech after a stroke is widespread, and impairs an individuals ability to effectively communicate, which is known to drastically reduce quality of life and self-sufficiency. Findings from this project will identify new possible directions for cognitive rehabilitation, neurological interventions, and behavioral modifications to substantially improve the communication abilities of stroke survivors.

FP00017808_Res1,55,,,,,1,,,"Modern clinical decision making depends on systematic reviews (SRs) to identify the best available research evidence. However, systematic reviews may take 6-18 months to complete and so clinical decisions may be based on outdated evidence which can negatively impact the quality of care. Frequently updated systematic reviews, Living Systematic Reviews (LSRs), have been proposed to keep up with the new research. However, the manual effort required in these tasks limits how quickly emerging research can be incorporated in the patient care. SRs start with a search of major bibliographic databases and screening of the titles and abstracts of the citations. Natural language processing (NLP) approaches current exist for abstract and title screening. However, the next step in the process, i.e. full text screening of articles, takes considerable amount of effort and it is where research and innovation is needed. Existing, abstract-screening NLP methods do not scale to full text reviews because of the text size (20-50 times larger than an abstract), discourse complexity, and confounding factors in the full text. While information retrieval can efficiently index and rapidly search full documents in response to a query, document relevancy does not necessarily imply inclusion of the article in the study. Here, we propose a novel NLP approach to full text article reviews for SRs and thus enable automated LSRs. Our proposal is enabled by several innovations, including reusable machine learning models for common classifiers, efficient and modern contextual language models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a two-level NLP model architecture to tackle the size and complexity of an articles full text, a novel concept called semantic information availability to identify the most information bearing sentences, an innovative semi-supervised approach requiring only small amount of labeled data for training the NLP models. Our proposed NLP approach is designed to ensure that it does not miss eligible articles (high sensitivity) and that it significantly reduces manual reviewing (best possible positive predictive value at high sensitivity). Specifically, we propose to create a high-quality dataset of full-text level judgments for articles reviewed for inclusion/exclusion for rigorous evaluation our approach and to encourage future research. We will develop a novel NLP approach to automating classifiers for full-text reviews and evaluate the NLP models precision (positive predictive rate) at a high fixed recall (sensitivity) and the manual effort needed for training the models. We will build an open source tool for automating SRs and LSRs, and assess the overall manual effort saved through the automation. The innovations proposed here will advance state of the art for automating SRs/LSRs",

With  advancements  in  electrode  design,  signal  processing,  and surgical  techniques,  most  CI  users  now  achieve  good  speech  recognition  in  quiet  environments.  However, current  CI  systems  do  not  preserve  spectro-temporal  fine  structure  cues  such  as  the  fundamental  frequency (F0) that contributes to pitch perception. This significant bottleneck of CI technology greatly limits the ability of CI  users  to  understand  speech  in  noise,  identify  talker  voice  characteristics,  and  appreciate  music. Our long-term  goal  is  to  improve  CI  performance  for  these  challenging  listening  tasks,  so  that  CI  users  can  enjoy  a better quality of life through improved speech communication and social interactions in daily activities. Towards that  goal,  we  propose  to  examine  the  utility  of  vibrotactile  stimulation  to  convey  fine  structure  cues  at  low frequencies to CI users. This idea is motivated by the benefit that CI users receive from traditional amplification of residual low-frequency hearing. For CI users without residual low-frequency hearing, vibrotactile stimulation may  be  an  alternative  way  to  encode  acoustic  cues  at  low  frequencies  such  as  the  F0,  amplitude  envelope, and  waveform  details,  because  touch  sense  has  a  similar  low-frequency  range  as  residual  hearing. Although tactile aids have been  explored as  a sensory substitute for profoundly deaf people before the development of CI,  the combined  use  of  vibrotactile  and  CI  stimulation  has  not  been  fully explored.  Based  on  recent  findings with  CI  and  vibrotactile  stimulation,  our  central  hypothesis  is  that  tactile  presentation  of  the  low-pass  filtered acoustic signal can be combined with electric hearing  of  a CI to significantly improve performance in listening tasks that require fine structure cues. We will test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 comparing the benefit of vibrotactile stimulation and residual hearing to CI performance In  Specific  Aim  1,  bimodal  CI  users  with  residual  low-frequency  hearing  will  be  tested  with  CI  alone, CI+hearing aid, and CI+vibrotactile stimulation to examine whether vibrotactile stimulation and residual hearing provide  similar  benefit  to  CI  performance.  This  study  design  also  allows  us  to  assess  the  potential  benefit  of vibrotactile stimulation to CI users without residual hearing (CI+vibrotactile stimulation vs. CI alone).  To identify acoustic cues that may be transmitted via vibrotactile stimulation to improve CI performance, three vibrotactile stimulation  strategies  will  be  implemented  to  convey  the  F0,  amplitude  envelope,  and  time  waveform  of  low-pass filtered acoustic signal, respectively. The vibrotactile stimulation will be delivered to the forearm top using a  portable  device  in  real  time.  Sentence  recognition  in  multi-talker,  speech-babble  noise  and  in  single-talker competing  speech,  vocal  emotion  recognition,  and  melodic  contour  identification  will  be  tested  with  each device condition and vibrotactile stimulation strategy. We predict that F0-based vibrotactile stimulation may be more useful for vocal  emotion recognition  and melodic contour identification, while amplitude envelope-based vibrotactile  stimulation  may  be  more  robust  to  noise  interference.  Both  the  F0  and  amplitude  envelope  cues may partially account for the benefit of waveform-based vibrotactile stimulation to CI performance. Large inter-subject  variability  in the  benefit  of  vibrotactile  stimulation  is  expected.  The  vibration  dynamic  range,  vibration frequency  discrimination,  and  CI-alone  performance  will  be  tested  as  potential  predictors  of  the  improvement with vibrotactile stimulation in each listening task. Specific Aim 2: increasing the benefit of vibrotactile stimulation to CI performance with training Training  can  effectively  optimize  the  performance  of  CI  users  and  their  adaptation  to  new  device settings. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the benefit of vibrotactile stimulation to CI users sentence recognition  in  noise,  vocal  emotion  recognition,  and  melodic  contour  identification  may  greatly  improve  with targeted training that promotes the integration of  acoustic and vibrotactile cues. Subjects from Specific Aim 1 will receive five days of training with feedback in each listening task using non-test stimuli with CI+vibrotactile stimulation. To simulate CI users without residual hearing,  subjects will not use hearing aid in Specific Aim 2. The best-performing vibrotactile stimulation strategy in Specific Aim 1 will be used. The effect of training will be tested by comparing the performance of each listening task with CI alone and CI+vibrotactile stimulation before and after training. The proposed research is a new approach to the examination of vibrotactile stimulation in combination with CI stimulation. By advancing our knowledge of the multi-modal integration of auditory and vibrotactile cues in a wide variety of challenging listening tasks, the research outcomes  will lay the groundwork for designing a non-invasive, inexpensive, and effective tactile aid that may greatly improve speech communication and social interactions with CI in daily life. B. Significance  According to NIH/NIDCD, nearly 188,000 profoundly deaf people worldwide use a cochlear implant (CI), which successfully supports on average 80% correct sentence recognition in quiet for most CI users (Wilson & Dorman, 2008). This is truly remarkable because the CI systems only use 12-22 electrodes to convey slowly varying temporal envelopes extracted from a corresponding small number of frequency bands. However, such crude mimicking of normal auditory periphery significantly degrades CI performance in listening tasks that need fine structure cues. For example, CI users pitch perception deficits have been studied extensively. Although stimulating different electrodes in CI can elicit distinct pitch sensations (generally consistent with the tonotopic organization of a normal cochlea), the small number of electrodes and the strong interaction between electrical  stimulation  of  adjacent  electrodes  greatly  reduce  the  spectral  resolution  that  is  required  for  reliable pitch  perception  (Mehta  and  Oxenham,  2017).  Different  pulse  rates  and  amplitude modulation  frequencies  of electrical stimulation on each electrode may also elicit distinct pitch sensations, but  such temporal pitch has a 300-Hz  upper  limit  (Zeng,  2002). With  poor  access  to  fine  structure  cues such  as the  fundamental  frequency (F0) that contributes to pitch perception, CI users experience great difficulty in (1) speech recognition in noise, (2) identification of talker voice characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion, and (3) appreciation of music. Improving CI performance for these challenging listening tasks may positively impact CI users quality of life in speech communication and social interactions in daily activities (Luo et al., 2018).   We propose to use low-frequency vibrotactile stimulation to  address the significant issue of limited fine structure cues with CI. Using tactile aids for  a sensory substitute in profoundly deaf people had a long history (see the review by the Working Group on Communication Aids for the Hearing-Impaired, 1991), but was largely abandoned with the development of CI technology. Tactile aid regains interest and attention with recent studies showing  that  F0-based  vibrotactile  stimulation  significantly  improved  sentence  recognition  in  speech-shaped, steady-state noise of CI users (Huang et al 2017) and vibrotactile stimulation based on low-frequency temporal envelope  significantly  improved  sentence  recognition  in  multi-talker,  speech-babble  noise  with  CI  simulation (Fletcher et al., 2018). However, a thorough understanding of the perceptual properties of touch sense and its use to encode different acoustic cues is needed for the effective combination of electric hearing and vibrotactile stimulation. Experiments in this proposal are designed to significantly advance our scientific knowledge in  this  front. This  proposal  is  also  of  high  clinical  relevance, because the research outcomes will lay the groundwork for designing a tactile aid for daily use as a non-invasive, inexpensive, and effective low-frequency channel that may greatly improve CI users performance in challenging listening tasks and their quality of life.  C. Innovation Great efforts have been made to increase CI users spectral resolution by shaping the electrical field of CI stimulation. For example, two adjacent electrodes may be stimulated at the same time with different current ratios to elicit intermediate pitch sensations or virtual channels (e.g., Donaldson et al., 2005). Also, stimulation current on an electrode may be returned to  the adjacent apical and basal electrodes to reduce current spread and  channel  interaction  (e.g.,  Bierer  et  al.,  2010).  However,  these  strategies  did  not  consistently  improve  CI users speech or music perception (e.g., Bierer and Litvak, 2016). In fact, Mehta and Oxenham (2017) suggest that complex pitch perception based on spectral cues may not be possible with the current method and site of CI stimulation. Thus, novel ideas are needed to effectively deliver spectral fine structures to CI users.  As the CI candidacy criteria become less stringent and the surgical technique of implantation improves, more  and  more  CI  users  have  residual  low-frequency  hearing  in  the  implanted  or  non-implanted  ear,  which may  provide  fine  structure  cues  at  low  frequencies.  Such  patients  often  wear  a  hearing  aid  (HA)  in  the  non-implanted ear along with CI for bimodal hearing. It has been shown that when residual  low-frequency hearing was  combined with  electric  hearing,  speech  recognition  in  noise  significantly  improved  and  the  improvement was found even when residual low-frequency hearing was limited to a pure tone carrying the F0 and amplitude envelope of target speech (Kong et al., 2005; Brown and Bacon, 2009). Bimodal hearing has also been shown to  significantly  improve  CI  performance  in  pitch-related  listening  tasks,  such  as  familiar  melody  recognition (Kong et al., 2005), vocal emotion recognition (Most et al., 2011), and Mandarin tone recognition (Chang et al., 2016).  However,  about  half  of  the  current  CI  users  have  no  residual  low-frequency  hearing,  and  as  a  result, cannot receive the bimodal benefit (Dorman et al., 2011).  We propose vibrotactile stimulation as an alternative way to send fine structure cues at low frequencies to CI users, because touch sense works best for frequencies below 500 Hz (Jones and Sarter, 2008), similar to the  low-frequency  range  of  residual  hearing  in  bimodal  CI  users.  The  tactile  presentation  of  acoustic cues  at low frequencies may be especially useful for CI users without residual low-frequency hearing. Motivated by the results  of  bimodal  hearing  and  recent  findings  with  CI+vibrotactile  stimulation,  we  will  test  and  compare  the contributions  of  F0,  amplitude  envelope,  and  time  waveform  of  low-pass  filtered  acoustic  signal  encoded  by vibrotactile stimulation to CI performance. F0-based vibrotactile stimulation  is not new (Boothroyd  and Hnath, 1986), but it has not been used along with CI until recently (Huang et al., 2017). Huang et al. (2017) found that relative to CI alone, CI+F0-based vibrotactile stimulation significantly reduced the speech reception threshold (SRT) or the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for 50% correct sentence recognition in speech-shaped, steady-state noise. To avoid F0 extraction from noisy speech, Fletcher et al. (2018) used the temporal envelope of low-pass filtered  acoustic  signal  to  modulate  the  amplitude  of  vibrotactile  stimulation  and  found  that  such  vibrotactile stimulation significantly improved sentence recognition  in multi-talker, speech-babble noise with CI simulation at a SNR equal to the SRT measured without vibrotactile stimulation. These promising results suggest that CI users can integrate electric hearing with vibrotactile stimulation to  better recognize speech in noise. However, there are unanswered questions regarding the use  of vibrotactile stimulation  with CI. For example, how is the benefit  of  vibrotactile  stimulation  compared  to  that  of  residual  hearing?  Do  they  share  similar  mechanisms? What  factors  may  explain  the  variable  benefit  of  vibrotactile  stimulation  to  different  subjects  in  Huang  et  al. (2017)  and  Fletcher  et  al.  (2018)?  Can  vibrotactile  stimulation  also  enhance  CI  users  perception  of  vocal emotions  and  musical  melodies?  Can  training  further  improve  the  benefit  of  vibrotactile  stimulation  to  CI performance?  Experiments  in  this  proposal  are  designed  with  these  questions  in  mind.  Although  CI  users without residual hearing are the target population for vibrotactile stimulation, bimodal CI users will be tested to compare the benefit of vibrotactile stimulation  to that of residual hearing (i.e., by testing CI alone, CI+HA, and CI+vibrotactile stimulation). This design also  allows us to test the potential benefit of vibrotactile stimulation to CI users without residual hearing (CI alone vs. CI+vibrotactile stimulation). In addition to sentence recognition in  noise,  two  other  pitch-related  listening  tasks  of  melodic  contour  identification  (MCI)  and  vocal  emotion recognition will also be tested. Compared to the amplitude envelope-based vibrotactile stimulation (Fletcher et al., 2018), the F0-based vibrotactile stimulation (Huang et al., 2017) may be more useful for listening tasks that solely or mainly rely on pitch cues (i.e., MCI and vocal emotion recognition). On the other hand, the amplitude envelope-based  vibrotactile  stimulation  may  be  more  robust  to  noise  interference  than  the  F0-based vibrotactile stimulation. A novel strategy will use vibrotactile stimulation to directly encode the time waveform of low-pass filtered acoustic signal and preserve the fine structure cues at low frequencies. Comparing the three strategies will reveal the cues that may account for the benefit of  vibrotactile stimulation.  All three vibrotactile stimulation strategies will be implemented in real time with a portable device aimed for daily use. To explain the inter-subject variability in benefit of vibrotactile stimulation, the dynamic range of vibrotactile stimulation, ability to discriminate vibration frequencies, and performance with CI alone in each listening task will be analyzed as potential predictors of the performance improvement with vibrotactile stimulation.  Specific Aim 1 will compare the benefit of the three vibrotactile stimulation strategies to CI performance. Specific Aim 2 will test the training effect of CI+vibrotactile stimulation with the best-performing vibrotactile stimulation strategy in Specific Aim 1.  D. Approach Pilot Study: MCI with combined CI simulation and F0-based vibrotactile stimulation Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 1 C B A Voltage (v)   A wearable vibrotactile  device (Fig. 1) originally designed to give private haptic feedback to musicians during  digital  musical  instrument  playing  (Hayes,  2013)  was  used  in  the  pilot  study.  A  Precision  Microdrives vibration motor with a 10-mm diameter and a 3-mm length (A in Fig. 1; similar to those in cell phones) was held in  position  using  Velcro  on  a  wristband  (B in  Fig.  1).  A  battery-powered  receiver  (C  in  Fig.  1) was  wirelessly controlled by the MAX software (www.cycling74.com) on a testing computer to vibrate the motor. Fig. 2 shows the amplitude (blue) and frequency (red) of vibration as a function of the input voltage. The vibration frequency increased  from  80 to  220  Hz  and  the  vibration  amplitude  increased  from 0.23  to  1.62  g  as  the  input  voltage increased from 0.7 to 3.7 volts. The vibration frequency thus co-varied with the vibration amplitude. Nine young adult NH listeners with hearing thresholds  better than 20 dB HL in both ears from 250 to 8000 Hz took part in the pilot study. Basic psychophysical testing was first used to measure the absolute and differential sensitivity of each subject to vibrotactile stimulation. The perceptual  acuity of tactile modality may partially determine the perceptual benefit of combined CI and vibrotactile stimulation to each subject. The results would also indicate the range of vibrotactile stimulation that can be used to encode acoustic cues. Although the fingertip was more sensitive to vibrotactile stimulation, the top of the right forearm was selected as the vibrotactile stimulation site (Fig. 3), because the vibration at forearm top had less interference with hand movements in daily life. Subjects rested their arms on a desk in a sound booth and put the hand palm-side down. The psychophysical method of limits with two ascending and descending sequences was used to measure the vibration detection threshold. In the ascending sequence, a 500-ms vibration started with a subthreshold level and gradually increased in level until the vibration was detected, while in the descending sequence, the vibration started with a supra-threshold level  and  gradually  decreased  in  level  until the  vibration  was  no  longer  detected.  The  ending  points  of  these ascending and descending sequences were averaged to  obtain the vibration detection threshold. The input for the lowest detectable  vibration level ranged from 0.71 to 0.82 volts for different subjects and corresponded to the turning point in Fig. 2, where the vibration amplitude and frequency started increasing with the input voltage. For each subject, the highest input level of 3.7 volts elicited a strong but comfortable feeling of vibration. Thus, the whole dynamic range of the vibration motor as shown in Fig. 2 can be used to encode acoustic cues.  The psychometric function of vibration frequency discrimination was measured using a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) task. In each trial, subjects received two 500-ms vibrations separated by a 100-ms gap. The two vibration frequencies  were centered on 110 Hz and differed by 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 semitones. The order of presentation was randomized for the two vibration frequencies and subjects were asked to choose the higher-frequency vibration. Each pair  of vibration frequencies was  tested  ten  times  in  random  order  in  each  session;  three sessions were completed. Fig. 4 shows the percent correct of discrimination as a function of interval size between vibration frequencies (squares). One-way repeated-measures  analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) showed that the vibration frequency discrimination  performance  was  significantly  affected  by  the interval size (F4,32 = 18.49, p < 0.001). Post-hoc Bonferroni t-tests  showed  that  the  performance  was  significantly  better with the 2- and 3-semitone intervals than with the 0.25-, 0.5-, and  1-semitone  intervals  (p  <  0.03).  Fig.  4  also  shows  pitch discrimination  scores  with  CI  alone  and  CI+HA  (downward and  upward  triangles,  respectively)  from  a  group  of  CI  users for  a  base  F0  of  131  Hz  measured  by  Gfeller  et  al.  (2007) using a similar method as described above. Our subjects vibration frequency discrimination performance was similar  to  the  pitch  discrimination  performance  with  CI+HA  and  better  than  that  with  CI  alone.  The  pilot  data suggest that vibrotactile stimulation may enhance the perception of low frequency changes by CI users. Fig. 4 The  benefit  of  vibrotactile  stimulation  was  investigated  for  a  pitch-related  music  listening  task  of  MCI (Galvin et al., 2007). MCI is a repeatable test that can be used to compare music perception in different device conditions and requires no prior familiarity with the stimuli. In the MCI test, each melodic contour had five 500-ms musical notes with 100-ms gaps in between. Each note was a harmonic complex tone with harmonics up to 4 KHz and a spectral slope of -8 dB/oct. There were nine contour patterns with the F0 increasing, decreasing, or staying the same between adjacent notes. The F0 of the middle (or the third) note was 220 or 880 Hz to test MCI in different pitch ranges. The F0 difference between adjacent notes was 1, 3, or 5 semitones to test MCI with different pitch intervals. In each trial, one of the 54 melodic contours (9 contour patterns x 2 middle F0s x 3 interval sizes) was randomly selected for presentation, and subjects were asked to identify the contour pattern. To  establish  the  feasibility  and  efficacy  of  combined  CI  and  vibrotactile  stimulation,  NH  listeners  were  tested with acoustic CI simulation in the pilot study because they were more homogeneous than CI users. To simulate CI performance, NH subjects listened to noise-vocoded stimuli with 4 or 8 frequency channels (Shannon et al., 1995).  Different  spectral  resolution  was  tested  for  its  effect  on  the  MCI  performance  with  CI  simulation  alone and on the benefit of vibrotactile stimulation. The noise-vocoded stimuli were presented at 65 dBA via a single loudspeaker  in  a  sound-treated  booth.  For  vibrotactile  stimulation,  the  F0 of  each  unprocessed  musical  note Frequency Interval (semitones)0.250.501.002.003.00Percent Correct020406080100Vibration Frequency DiscriminationPitch Discrimination with CI alonePitch Discrimination with EASGfeller et al. (2007)was extracted by the MAX software to control the motor vibration frequency at the forearm top, all in real time. A threshold level of noise floor was set to detect the presence of musical notes and a 1024-point Fast Fournier Transform was used to get the short-term spectra of musical notes, from which the F0 with maximum likelihood was estimated and then smoothed over time using a one-pole low-pass filter. Because the motor had a limited vibration  frequency range from 80 to 220 Hz (Fig. 2), the F0s around 220 and 880 Hz  of musical notes were transposed to the vibration frequencies  around 110 Hz  using division by a ratio of 2 and 8, respectively. Both the order and ratio between frequencies important for music perception were preserved after the transposition. NH subjects were first tested with MCI with vibrotactile stimulation alone. Three subjects scored better than 70% correct, while the other six did not. The six poorer performers then received a one-hour training with feedback for MCI with vibrotactile stimulation alone. Unlike the tested stimuli, the training stimuli had 2- and 4-semitone but not 1-, 3-, and 5-semitone intervals and were centered on 110 and 440 Hz. The division ratio for frequency transposition was  1 and 4 for the two middle F0s, respectively. The testing and training procedures only differed in that feedback regarding response correctness was given after each trial during training but not during testing. After each incorrect response, the stimulus was replayed with the correct response highlighted. As shown in Fig. 5, this short training greatly improved the six NH subjects MCI performance  with vibrotactile stimulation alone. A two-way RM ANOVA showed that  the MCI performance was significantly affected by the interval size (F2,10 = 55.34, p < 0.001) and training (F1,5 = 45.08, p = 0.001). There was no interaction between the two factors (F2,10 =1.52, p=0.27), suggesting that MCI with different pitch intervals all improved with training. Fig. 5 Fig. 6 Fig. 7  Nine NH subjects then performed MCI with 4- and 8-channel CI simulation alone and 4- and 8-channel CI simulation+vibrotactile stimulation, which were tested in random order. All subjects perceived the vibrotactile stimulation to be synchronized with the acoustic  CI simulation. At the beginning of each condition, there were ten  practice trials  without  feedback  using  randomly  selected  non-test  stimuli.  Fig.  6  shows the  MCI  scores  in different conditions. A two-way RM ANOVA revealed that the number of channels in CI simulation significantly affected  MCI  (F1,8  =  13.50,  p  =  0.006). Although  vibrotactile  stimulation  had  no  significant main  effect  (F1,8 = 2.12, p = 0.18), it significantly interacted with the number of channels in CI simulation (F1,8 = 5.95, p = 0.037). Post-hoc  Bonferroni  t-tests  showed  that  MCI  was  significantly  better  with  8-channel  than  with  4-channel  CI simulation alone (p = 0.001), and vibrotactile stimulation significantly improved MCI with 4-channel (p = 0.03) but not with 8-channel CI simulation (p = 0.90). To explain the variable benefit of vibrotactile stimulation across subjects,  we  tested  whether  the  vibration  detection  threshold,  vibration  frequency  discrimination  score,  MCI performance with vibrotactile stimulation alone, and MCI performance with CI simulation alone were correlated with the MCI improvement with vibrotactile stimulation. Pearson correlations showed that the MCI performance with CI simulation alone was significantly correlated with the MCI improvement with vibrotactile stimulation (r = -0.87, p = 0.004 for 4-channel CI simulation; Fig. 7) except for one subject. In other words, subjects with poorer baseline performance with CI simulation alone received greater benefit from the vibrotactile stimulation. General methods of the proposal: Ten male and ten female post-lingually deafened, native English-speaking, adult bimodal CI users with a wide variety of implant experience (>1 years) and performance, who use a HA in the non-implanted ear, will be tested, so that the benefit of vibrotactile stimulation  can be compared to that of residual hearing. The potential benefit of vibrotactile stimulation to CI users without residual hearing can  also be evaluated by avoiding the use of residual hearing in bimodal users. The subject number is determined by a power analysis of the pilot data with 4-channel CI simulation using G*Power (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/) for  <  0.05  and  power  >  0.95. Subjects will  be  tested  with  their  own  CI  device  in clinically  assigned  settings.  For each subjects HA device, a real-ear  assessment will be performed to determine whether  or not the  output is sufficient  to  meet  the  prescribed  target  (National  Acoustics  Labs,  NAL)  for  the  subjects  hearing  loss.

Co-investigator Dr. Andrea Pittman will provide oversight for the verification and correction of HA fitting. When the HA is not tested, an ear plug will be inserted into the non-implanted ear to avoid the use of residual hearing.  Acoustic  stimuli will  be  presented  in  a  sound  booth  via  a  loudspeaker  at  65  dBA.  In  this  proposal,  a TactileLabs Haptuator Mark II (www.tactilelabs.com/products/haptics/haptuator-mark-ii-v2/) small in size will be used to send vibrotactile stimulation to the top of right forearm. It can be driven as a common loudspeaker and thus allows independent control of the vibration frequency and amplitude. It also has a wider frequency range than the Precision Microdrives vibration motor used in the pilot study.  Specific Aim 1 comparing the benefit of vibrotactile stimulation and residual hearing to CI performance  To better understand how vibrotactile stimulation may contribute to CI performance, Specific Aim 1 will compare the benefit of three vibrotactile stimulation strategies (based on the F0, amplitude envelope, and time waveform, respectively) and residual hearing to CI performance in speech recognition in noise, vocal emotion recognition, and MCI. Each vibrotactile stimulation strategy will use vibration frequencies up to 500 Hz (i.e., the most  sensitive  frequency  range  of  human  touch  sense;  Jones  and  Sarter,  2008).  As  such,  frequency transposition is needed for acoustic signals with F0s above 500 Hz (e.g., musical notes from melodic contours with an 880-Hz middle F0) but not for those with F0s below 500 Hz (e.g., voiced speech segments and musical notes from melodic contours with a 220-Hz middle F0). The vibration detection threshold and most comfortable level of vibration will be measured for  50-, 150-, 250-, 350-, and 450-Hz vibration frequencies using the same method as in the pilot study.  Vibration frequency discrimination for a  center vibration frequency of 250 Hz will also be tested using the same method as in the pilot study. For the F0-based vibrotactile stimulation (similar to that in Huang et al., 2017), the F0 will be extracted from the acoustic signal using the same MAX program as in the pilot study. If below 500 Hz, the F0 will be directly used as the frequency of a sawtooth vibration waveform at  the  most  comfortable  level.  If  above  500  Hz  (e.g.,  up  to  880  x  2  =  1760  Hz  for  the  musical  notes  from melodic contours with an 880-Hz middle F0), the F0 will be divided by 4 and then used as the frequency of the sawtooth  vibration  waveform.  The  temporally  sharpened  sawtooth  waveform  may  improve  the  perception  of pitch periodicity (Green et al., 2004). For the amplitude envelope-based vibrotactile stimulation (similar to that in Fletcher et al., 2018), if the F0 of acoustic signal is below 500 Hz, the acoustic signal from 10 to 500 Hz will be  divided  into  5  evenly  distributed  frequency  bands  (i.e.,  10-100,  100-200,  200-300,  300-400,  and  400-500 Hz). A 10-Hz amplitude envelope will be extracted from each band, compressed to the vibration dynamic range at  the  center  frequency  of  each  band  (i.e.,  50,  150,  250,  350,  and  450  Hz),  and  then  used  to  modulate  the amplitude of  a pure tone  at the center  of  each band. These  amplitude-modulated pure tones will be summed as the signal for vibrotactile stimulation. If the F0 of acoustic signal is above 500 Hz, the acoustic signal from 500 to 2000 Hz will be divided into 4 frequency bands (i.e., 500-800, 800-1200, 1200-1600, and 1600-2000 Hz). The 10-Hz amplitude envelope of each band will be compressed and used for amplitude modulation of a pure tone  at  150,  250,  350,  and  450  Hz,  respectively  (i.e.,  at   of  the  center  frequency  of  each  band).  Again,  the sum of these amplitude-modulated pure tones will be used for vibrotactile stimulation. For the waveform-based vibrotactile stimulation, if the F0 of acoustic signal is below 500 Hz, the acoustic signal from 10 to 500 Hz will be  divided  into  5  frequency  bands  (i.e.,  10-100,  100-200,  200-300,  300-400,  and  400-500  Hz).  The  acoustic signal  of  each  band,  instead  of  its  10-Hz  amplitude  envelope,  will  be  compressed  to  the  vibration  dynamic range at the center frequency of each band and then summed for vibrotactile stimulation. If the F0 of acoustic signal  is  above  500  Hz, the  acoustic  signal  from  500 to  2000  Hz will  be  divided  into  4  frequency  bands  (i.e., 500-800, 800-1200, 1200-1600, and 1600-2000 Hz). After compression and summation, the band-pass filtered acoustic signals will be presented at  of the original sampling rate to  achieve linear frequency lowering by a factor  of  4  for  vibrotactile  stimulation.  CI  alone,  CI+HA,  and  each  vibrotactile  stimulation  strategy  combined with CI will be tested in random order. MCI will be tested  as described in the pilot study. The clinical standard Hearing  in  Noise  Test  (HINT;  Nilsson  et  al.,  1994)  will  be  modified  for  use.  The  recognition  scores  of  HINT sentences  spoken  by  a  male  talker  will  be  tested  in  the  presence  of  multi-talker,  speech-babble  noise,  IEEE sentences (Hawley  et al., 1999)  spoken by a different male talker, and IEEE sentences spoken by a different fem",
FP00017975_Rev2,57,,,,,1,,,"BackgroundEquality Health (EH) is an integrated healthcare delivery system founded in 2015 that focuses on delivering culturally effective comprehensive care management services to patients enrolled in the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) health plans (Arizona Medicaid), Medicare advantage plans and others. In an effort to reduce the known health disparities reported for Hispanic patients1,2,3, EH has integrated a Cultural Care model5 into patient care that includes the Health Access Survey, an assessment for cultural and social determinants of health, also known as the Socio-Cultural Risk Assessment (SCRA)5. The original version, SCRA 1.0, English and Spanish language versions, have undergone psychometric assessment, serial improvements, and validation over the past two years.6 Final validation steps to migrate the English version to 2.0 occurred during the pandemic using digital dissemination.7 Application of similar methodology did not yield sufficient Spanish language SCRAs for rigorous validation.  Project PurposeThe purpose of this project is to validate the Spanish SCRA 2.0, review and document the end-to-end process of both language versions, prepare manuscript(s) for submission to high quality peer-reviewed journals, and provide a road map for subsequent SCRA and SCRA-related research.  Research PlanData UseThe results from the project will be used internally by EH to guide patient quality assessment and improvement efforts, and externally in the form of journal publications. Preliminary results may also be shared in conference presentations.Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaEligible individuals will include adults assigned to medical providers participating in the Equality Health Network, and who are AHCCCS enrollees, participants in qualifying Medicare health plans, or the professionals who work in the Equality Health Network. Because the project aims to understand the ability of the assessment to predict risk in underserved populations, patients who are pregnant and patients of Native American background will be included. Incarcerated individuals and undocumented individuals will be excluded from the patient cohort. Project DesignThe SCRA 2.0 Spanish language version will be piloted at a Phoenix clinic with several locations in areas with high Hispanic population density as identified by EH. The project team will collect approximately 300 Spanish language SCRAs from individuals meeting eligibility criteria to ensure a minimum number of 250 completed surveys are available for analysis. As with prior analyses, the Spanish SCRA 2.0 will be administered within the usual clinic care workflow. The surveys will be administered on a paper-based format during the clinic check-in process before scheduled visits with a health care provider. A family member or office staff member may assist an adult patient with completion of the survey. Surveys from the clinic locations will be collected and sent to EH through optical character recognition (OCR) or PDF transfer. EH will transfer the surveys to CHiR via a secure method. CHiR will analyze the surveys in its secure server environment using descriptive demographics, mean scores by question and score distributions. Internal consistency using Cronbachs alpha will be calculated and other Factor analyses will be performed.",

FP00018201,59,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary Understanding the factors that drive evolutionary changes and geographic spread of the influenza A virus is critical for implementing effective public health preparedness to curb the epidemic and reduce morbidity and mortality. Because of the continuing challenges produced by antigenic drift, there is now a recognized need to leverage next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for sequence-informed pathogen surveillance. However, the evolutionary diffusion of the influenza A virus in the U.S. is not well understood even after the development of numerous mathematical models and NGS data. The complex relationship between antigenic drift and geographic spread becomes even more dynamic during co-circulation. In the U.S., seasonal influenza A H3N2 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pdm09) have been co-circulating since the 2008-09 season. Initially, pdm09 was dominant in the population, but it then shifted to H3N2 which is considered the more severe virus. However, during the 2018-2019 season, there was a switch back to pdm09 as the dominant strain. The evolutionary diffusion of influenza is impacted by climate, human mobility, molecular, and phenotypic factors; however, the relative contribution of each still remains unclear. For example, previous studies have found conflicting relationships between low humidity environments and influenza transmission. Additionally, there is a substantial knowledge gap in regard to the role of human mobility on the evolutionary diffusion of influenza in the U.S. For example, prior work has exposed the role of air travel on virus diffusion from a global perspective; however, it is still unclear how local travel behavior impacts virus diffusion at a regional scale. Finally, the explanatory power of molecular, and phenotypic characteristics including amino acid mutations, virus morphology, receptor binding, and neuraminidase activity on virus transmission demands further exploration. In this work we aim to address each of these outstanding research questions. For this project, we will isolate, and sequence human influenza A viruses collected prospectively over five seasons and across the United States in order to evaluate a sequence-informed influenza surveillance system. We will perform laboratory analysis of several phenotypic features of the virus for each sample. We will also examine the role of human mobility on influenza A transmission. We will then use sequences and phenotypic data to develop phylogeographic models to enhance our knowledge of influenza spread in the U.S. In particular, we will: develop a sequence-informed influenza A surveillance system (Aim 1); examine molecular and viral phenotypes, from clinical isolates, that are suspected of impacting transmission (Aim 2); develop and evaluate human mobility models at different geographic scales (Aim 3); evaluate the impact of various predictors, including viral phenotypes and human mobility, on virus diffusion (Aim 4). We will also examine the translational impact of our approach to influenza surveillance in the US by soliciting feedback from epidemiologists at state health departments. ",

Accurate diagnosis is difficult due to variability in language skills and similarities between typical bilingual development and language disorders in monolingual children. The current project aims are: 1) To develop a dynamic model of bilingual language latent growth profiles from Kindergarten to 4th grade using measures sensitive to developmental language disorder (DLD). 2) To examine predictors of typical and atypical (DLD) English/Spanish language growth profiles identified in Aim 1 examining English-only and bilingual education contexts, and 3) To examine the educational impact of the typical and atypical growth profiles identified in Aim 1. This project will create a dynamic model of bilingualism that will include typical and atypical patterns of language growth based on measures sensitive to DLD. We further develop the dynamic model of bilingualism by including external predictors of language profiles, such as language use at home and at school and demographic information. Lastly, we include a measure of educational impact of typical and atypical language profiles by examining reading comprehension outcomes.We propose to examine language and memory measures in 690 kindergarten- 4th grade Spanish-English bilingual children and follow them longitudinally for 3 years. Specifically, we examine grammatical, semantic, and phonological working memory skills in English and Spanish. We also examine reading comprehension in Spanish and English in second to 4th grade. The children are evaluated once a year from kindergarten to fourth grade using a cohort sequential design, whereby students will be recruited from three cohorts starting at kindergarten, 1st grade and 2nd grade. For the first aim of the study, latent growth profiles, exploratory latent variable profile analyses will be used. Selection of the optimal number of latent profiles will be completed by comparing models with differing numbers of profiles using model fit statistics. For aim 2, predictors of the profiles, we will extend the analyses from Aim 1 to include external predictors of longitudinal latent language profiles over time. Specifically, we will examine the following predictors: family language use at home, language of instruction at school, and maternal education. We will use mixed model multivariate repeated measure analyses to examine differences in external predictors across language profile groups. For aim 3, we will extend the analyses from Aim 1 to include second, third, and fourth grade Spanish and English reading comprehension outcomes.  Results of these studies will help us identify dual language learners with atypical language by giving us information of what the typical and atypical language patterns are in each language. By identifying external predictors of these profiles, we will determine which contexts lead to better outcomes reading. In this way, we can determine what is typical and atypical in the different linguistic contexts.",
FP00018439,61,,,,,1,,,"Project summary Overview Cyanobacterial  harmful  algal  blooms  (CHABs)  arise  in  eutrophic  waters,  resulting  from  the  superior ecophysiology  of  some  cyanobacteria  in  eutrophic  waters.  However,  the  ecophysiology  of  the  various bloom formers is not completely understood, and attaining this knowledge is a priority in CHAB research. The objective of the proposed work is to increase our knowledge of CHABs by identifying the functional genomic repertoire (e.g., metabolic pathways) contributing to the natural success of CHABs, and to verify these candidate functional pathways in laboratory and natural settings. From the perspective of functional niche  specialization,  the  overarching  hypothesis  is  that  genomic  units  (e.g.,  metabolic  pathways) contributing to CHABs are more enriched in blooming than nonblooming species, differentially expressed (used) between eutrophic and oligotrophic waters, and eventually promote bloom formation in eutrophic waters. The proposed research provides the functional capabilities in cyanobacterial bloom formers, which are central to converting elevated nutrients in eutrophic waters into biomass in CHABs. Our team has a combined expertise in aquatic ecology, microbiology, and multi-omics (genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics) to ensure the success of the proposed research. This research is novel and transformative as it applies a general niche theory to test an ecological genomics hypothesis using combined multi-omics and ecological approaches, which will lead to new synthesis of ecophysiology for CHABs. Intellectual Merit The  proposed  research  will  help  establish  much-needed  common  ecophysiological  principles  among diverse cyanobacterial bloom species. These common principles will provide CHAB researchers with the genetic basis not only to study the causal relationship between water eutrophication and bloom formation but also to explore more species-specific ecophysiology in different eutrophic waters. This will lead to a more  comprehensive  and  genetically  verified  ecophysiology  for  CHABs.  Our  proposed  research  will  provide a new perspective on CHABs, as it (1) applies the functional niche specialization theory to an ecological question; (2) reconstructs ecologically-inferred individual pathways into one set of functions and tests them between bloom and non-bloom formers; and (3) provides a much-needed common genetic basis for  CHABs,  which  provides  a  framework  for  more  integrated  studies  of  CHABs.  Given  the  continued intensification and global expansion of CHABs, this genetic basis will allow an integrated assessment of CHAB capabilities using high-throughput holistic systems biology approaches. Finally, we will synthesize existing knowledge and genetic information into one web server, which will provide a platform facilitating the continued research into CHABs by the community.  Broader Impacts   This  proposed  research  will  provide  information  of  central  importance  to  study  the  development  and potential control of CHABs, which are hazards in eutrophic waters worldwide and are often toxic to animals and humans. We will provide access to our findings to the research community and general public through our proposed web server, to promote awareness of CHABs. Educationally, this project will provide training for two graduate students and at least four undergraduate students; the latter through formal educational laboratory training initiatives in the ASU School of Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Program and Microbial EducatioN Training and OutReach program. The outcomes will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, local outreach events (e.g., ASU OPEN-DOOR science fair), and oral and poster presentations on local and international workshops and conferences (ESA annual meeting, US Symposium on Harmful Algae, International Conference on Toxic Cyanobacteria). Thus, the project will be quickly shared among the community to catalyze more related studies, toward a better control of these harmful blooms. ",
FP00018522_Res1,62,,,,,1,,,"The potential of the avian influenza (AI) virus to evolve into a human influenza pandemic establishes it as one of the major emerging infections in global health surveillance. In recent years, there have been a number of unprecedented and concerning shifts in global AI epidemiology, which indicates there is now a greater need to evaluate AI pandemic emergence and risk. An unparalleled number of AI strains have emerged in the last decade compared to any time previously in history. Concurrent and ongoing outbreaks of AI in poultry have been reported in an increasing number of countries, in Asia, Africa, the Americas, Middle East and Europe. The likelihood of a major influenza pandemic occurring is increased given this unprecedented rise in AI outbreaks in birds around the world and the number of zoonotic AI serotypes. In addition, travel and globalization mean that infections arising in one country can spread rapidly around the globe, and therefore risk assessment, early epidemic detection and mitigation are important in reducing global risk. However, it is difficult to predict when and where the next pandemic strain will emerge let alone predict how the it will spread as there are a large number of factors which could contribute to an emergence. In this project, we will develop a novel risk assessment framework which integrates different types of methodologies and data for evaluating the emergence of human transmissible AI. Here, we will use Vietnam with the population of more than 95 million people, as a case study. While much of the attention regarding AI has been on China, Vietnam has historically been affected by many emerging infections, including the SARS epidemic of 2003 and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 avian influenza. It shares borders with China, Laos and Cambodia, also high-risk countries for emerging infections. We hypothesize that combining genetic and Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered (SIR) approaches for predicting AI pandemic risk will provide policymakers with a highly useful tool for identifying areas at risk of AI pandemic emergence and predicting how the virus will likely spread over time.Our specific aims are to: Develop serological, genetic and epidemiological datasets for AI H5N1 surveillance in Vietnam (Aim 1); Use these data as input into our models for assessing risk (Aim 2). Here, we will develop a risk modeling framework which utilizes phylogeography, spatial, and stochastic and approaches; Develop a web portal and system architecture for our risk modeling framework and perform stakeholder engagement and evaluation (Aim 3). As part of this effort, we will conduct policy development workshops with Vietnamese officials during which we will have them evaluate our risk models for AI planning and surveillance at the population level.Our project is strengthened by collaboration with a major Vietnamese surveillance institute that enables us to build capacity and enhance infectious disease modeling in Vietnam.",

Many women suffer in silence because they or their clinicians have concerns with the usual care (antidepressants, psychotherapy) due to stigma, side effects, fetal effects, and limited resources or access. These barriers to appropriate care suggest a need for an easily-accessible, non-pharmacologic, and inexpensive intervention, and internet-based approaches have gained traction as pragmatic methods to address these common barriers. At present, no systematic internet-based efforts aimed at addressing perinatal depression symptoms exist in the U.S. Our proposed study will address this gap by evaluating a universal preventive intervention for perinatal depressive symptoms Mamma Mia an internet-based individualized program in a large scale randomized controlled international study. We recently established the feasibility and effectiveness of Mamma Mia for postpartum depressive symptoms in 1342 women in Norway. The proposed study builds upon these findings by adapting the intervention for a diverse U.S. audience and adding an element of guided support (Mamma Mia Plus) to enhance retention. Hence, the primary aim of this three-arm randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of Mamma Mia versus Mamma Mia Plus versus the usual care on depressive symptoms for diverse perinatal women in the U.S. and Norway (n=2443). The secondary aim is to evaluate effects on subjective well-being, anxiety, and stress. The tertiary aim is to evaluate moderators and mediators of the effects. We have received a commitment of funding from the Research Council of Norway to support the Norwegian research activities if we successfully obtain funding from NIH for the U.S.-based activities. If proven effective, Mamma Mia may be a sustainable and translatable option for prevention and intervention in perinatal depression. With proven efficacy and with the knowledge gained regarding contextual variables that contribute to efficacy, the next steps will be to evaluate dissemination and implementation at the provider and organization level in support of deployment of Mamma Mia as a universal prevention intervention at the national and international level. [24 lines]                                   Specific Aims  Prevention and reduction of perinatal depressive symptoms is an urgent clinical and research priority.1,2  Nearly 20% of women in the United States experience clinically significant depressive symptoms during pregnancy or the postpartum period.3 Untreated or under-treated depressive symptoms are associated with poor maternal-child outcomes such as adverse birth and neonatal outcomes (e.g., preterm birth and low birth weight), adverse postpartum outcomes (e.g., postpartum depression and suicidality, decreased breastfeeding initiation, impaired child development),46 and economic burden to the individual and society (e.g., inability to work, increased medical costs, comorbidities).7 Many women suffer in silence because usual care of antidepressants and/or psychotherapy is often eschewed by pregnant women or clinicians due to stigma, side effects, fetal effects, and limited resources or access.811 Women in health disparity populations (e.g., minority populations) are at particularly high risk of depressive symptoms and increased barriers to care, including low adherence to prenatal care.12,13 These barriers to appropriate care suggest a need for an easily-accessible, non-pharmacologic, and inexpensive intervention. Internet-based approaches provide a pragmatic solution for addressing the numerous barriers to effective prevention of and intervention in perinatal depressive symptoms, providing an engaging environment to enhance self-management of symptoms.14   At present, no systematic internet-based efforts aimed at addressing perinatal depression symptoms exist in the U.S.15 Our proposed study will address this gap by evaluating a universal preventive intervention for perinatal depressive symptoms Mamma Mia an internet-based individualized program in a large scale randomized controlled international study. We recently established the feasibility and effectiveness of Mamma Mia for postpartum depressive symptoms in 1342 women in Norway.1618 Mamma Mia consists of 44 short modules for use from the second trimester of pregnancy through six months postpartum; modules include a variety of evidence-based content shown to address common risks of perinatal depressive symptoms.17 In the proposed study, we will adapt Mamma Mia to welcome a diverse U.S. audience and we will explore the impact of adding guided support (Mamma Mia Plus), given that guided internet programs for depression have shown promising results to reduce the attrition.19,20  Our interdisciplinary team is highly qualified to conduct this study, combining key strengths of the teams across the U.S. and Norway including expertise in: biobehavioral nursing research in perinatal depressive symptom self-management (Kinser, PI at Virginia Commonwealth University); large nationally recruited, internet-based perinatal interventions (Huberty, site PI at Arizona State University); development and testing of Mamma Mia in Norway (Haga, site PI at National Center for Infant Mental Health). We have received a commitment of funding from the Research Council of Norway to support the Norwegian research activities on the condition that we successfully obtain funding from NIH for the U.S.-based activities. The overall goal of this international three-arm randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects of three treatment conditions: Mamma Mia (self-guided internet-based intervention), Mamma Mia Plus (self-guided intervention plus guided clinical support), and usual care, for diverse women in the U.S. (n=1950) and Norway (n=493).  Specific Aim 1: To compare the effects of three treatment conditions on the primary outcome of depressive symptom severity (measured by the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale), from baseline to six months postpartum. Hypothesis: Women who participate in Mamma Mia and Mamma Mia Plus will have lower depressive symptom scores over time compared to those in usual care; women who participate in Mamma Mia Plus will have greater long-term engagement (retention), sustaining symptom improvements over time.   Specific Aim 2: To compare the effects of three treatment conditions on secondary outcomes of subjective well-being, anxiety, and stress, from pregnancy to six months postpartum. Hypothesis: Women who participate in Mamma Mia and Mamma Mia Plus will have improved subjective well-being, decreased anxiety, and stress over time compared to those in usual care.  Specific Aim 3: To explore (a) whether the effects of the intervention are mediated by perceived support, self-efficacy for parenting and breastfeeding, and self-regulation; and, (b) whether the effects are moderated by contextual variables, such as age, race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, baseline depressive symptom severity, parity, and type of healthcare clinician providing obstetric and postpartum care.  This study addresses the focus of NICHD to enhance maternal-child health and reduce societal costs through health-promotion and disease prevention strategies. If proven effective, Mamma Mia may be a sustainable and translatable option for prevention and intervention in perinatal depression. With proven efficacy and with the knowledge gained regarding contextual variables that contribute to efficacy, the next steps will be to evaluate dissemination and implementation at the provider and organization level in support of deployment of Mamma Mia as a universal prevention intervention at the national and international level.  A. Significance  A.1. Scientific Premise: This proposal for the Mamma Mia international three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) in pregnant women in the U.S. and Norway is based on 3 premises:   PROBLEM: Depression in the perinatal period (pregnancy and postpartum) is a serious public health  problem responsible for significant suffering and adverse maternal, child, and family outcomes. Despite this, perinatal depression often remains untreated due to barriers accessing care, stigma, concerns with side effects, and cost. INTERVENTION: Individualized non-pharmacologic strategies that are easily accessible via the internet may eliminate barriers and empower pregnant and postpartum women in symptom self-management.  Mamma Mia is a multi-modal internet-based strategy for preventing and intervening with perinatal depressive symptoms.    METHOD: Building upon previous findings from pilot studies and a RCT in Norway, pregnant women will enroll in the study and be randomized to one of 3 groups: (1) Mamma Mia in which they engage in 44 modules throughout their pregnancy and the first six months postpartum; (2) Mamma Mia Plus in which they engage in the Mamma Mia modules plus receive brief guided support from a registered nurse to encourage use of the website, in an effort to minimize attrition that typically occurs with internet-based programs; or, (3) usual prenatal/postpartum care. With digital intervention delivery and outcome ascertainment, this is a pragmatic study of a potentially low-cost, easily translatable intervention.  A.2. Perinatal Depression is a Public Health Problem: At any given time in the United States, close to four million women are pregnant21 and, of these, nearly 20%, or 800,000 women, experience clinically significant depressive symptoms.22 Similarly, approximately 1 in 5 postpartum women experience depressive symptoms, often with symptoms originating in pregnancy,23,24 underscoring the importance of early prevention/ intervention. Depressive symptoms may include depressed mood, loss of interest, changes in weight, alterations in sleep, fatigue, guilt/ worthlessness, indecisiveness, and suicidality.23 Depressive symptoms are projected to be a leading cause of illness and disability in the world by 2030.25 The Institute of Medicine report on Living Well with Chronic Conditions suggests that depressive symptoms carry great potential to threaten well-being, particularly if symptoms progress to further chronic illness.26   Appropriate prevention and treatment of perinatal depressive symptoms is essential. Of the large number of perinatal women experiencing depressive symptoms, the majority remain under- or un-treated, suffering in silence due to limited resources or access,8,27 concerns with the stigma of depression,9,11 and/or concerns with side effects10 or fetal effects of the usual care (e.g., pharmacology and psychotherapy).2830 Inadequate treatment of this potentially debilitating condition is associated with numerous poor maternal-child health outcomes, such as adverse effects for: (1) the pregnant woman including increased stress, decreased social support, decreased attachment, poor health behaviors (e.g., substance use, decreased physical activity);31,32 (2) birth outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight;6 (3) postpartum outcomes, including postpartum depression and suicidality;33 (4) the child, including decreased breastfeeding and impaired child development;34,35 and, (5) regarding economic burden to the individual and society include development of comorbidities, inability to work, and increased medical costs.7,28 In addition, perinatal depression is often related to other symptoms such as stress and anxiety and can affect feelings of subjective well-being. Further, prevention and resilience-based research calls for a focus on enhancing and sustaining mental health to buffer human strengths in the face of difficulty instead of solely on preventing mental illness.36,37 For example, studies have consistently found that individuals with higher levels of subjective well-being (often defined as high life satisfaction and more positive than negative emotions38) are better able to cope with and sustain social connections during stressful life events (e.g., the birth of a child).3941 These findings underscore the need for additional, more acceptable and effective prevention/ intervention strategies than the usual care, particularly ones that enhance subjective well-being and prevent depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety.   A.3. Mamma Mia Shows Promise as a Universal Prevention and Intervention Strategy: Mamma Mia is a fully automated individualized self-managed internet-based program for preventing and intervening with perinatal depression. As a preventive intervention, it is intended to engage women in self-management not only to prevent the development of depressive symptoms through tailored information and activities but also to help a woman become aware of symptoms and seek help when appropriate. Mamma Mia consists of 44 sessions over a period of 11.5 months, delivered by an interactive website combining text, pictures, audio files, and user input. The intervention was tailored specifically to the perinatal period by using evidence-based treatments that target risk and protective factors for perinatal depressive symptoms (e.g., mindfulness, infant attachment, communication with partners, social support, breastfeeding, subjective well-being).17 It was developed in close collaboration with perinatal women, midwives, and public health nurses, with the intent of preventing the onset or development of depression and easing the transition of becoming a mother by providing knowledge and support during pregnancy and after birth.17 Recent pilot studies have demonstrated feasibility and acceptability18 and a RCT demonstrated efficacy in a large Norwegian population (n=1342), although with a high attrition rate.16 Mamma Mia has been adapted by this research team for a diverse U.S. audience, through the use of diverse images and translation of key concepts, and a recent pilot study in the U.S. reported below.   Self-management-- the individuals active engagement in self-monitoring, self-reflection, and actions/ behaviors to manage the medical, role, and emotional context of their health-- is a crucial component of depressive symptom management that may occur alone or in conjunction with other clinician-directed treatments.42,43 Self-management interventions empower patients to participate actively in healthy self-care activities.44 The Mamma Mia intervention proposed in this study provides an important self-management tool for enhancing self-awareness of symptoms and yielding sustainable health behavior change. This application addresses the urgent need for adjunctive approaches for preventing/ intervening with perinatal depressive symptoms.45,46 Further, pregnancy is typically a critical period during which women become more interested in and more committed to engaging in self-management activities for their mental health and the health of their developing child. Pregnancy is considered to be a teachable moment during a womans life, defined by McBride and colleagues as a life transition/ health event that can enhance an individuals motivation to adopt healthier behaviors.47 Hence, this self-management intervention is highly relevant and well-suited to be initiated during pregnancy, as it is timed to capitalize on a womans increased intrinsic motivation to engage in knowledge acquisition and healthy activities for her health and that of her baby and because it will allow a woman to gain skills relevant both for managing depressive symptoms and for potentially preventing or managing future symptoms.  Internet-based programs have shown promising results for depression, with effect sizes equivalent to those of face-to-face treatment.20 Internet interventions may overcome many obstacles in the dissemination of traditional face-to-face approaches, providing convenience and accessibility to participants.48 The anonymity available in self-managed internet-based programs lowers the threshold for individuals reticent to seek professional help.14 In addition, internet-based self-management programs which involve a small aspect of guidance from persons with lived experience of the condition or from health personnel have shown particularly promising results for depression;19 hence, our addition of the Mamma Mia Plus arm of the proposed study. Recent systematic reviews on internet interventions for perinatal mental health suggest they may be effective in reducing perinatal depression.20 However, few of the existing interventions are tailored specifically to pregnancy and the postpartum period, which is remarkable considering the unique changes, difficulties, and mental health issues that are specific to the perinatal period.49,50 In addition, it is unknown how these interventions work and for whom, thus research exploring potential mediating and moderating variables that explain the effect of treatments is warranted, particularly as preparation for future implementation studies.  B. Innovation In this international randomized controlled trial, we capitalize on the unique opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in Norway and enhance fiscal capital through the dedication of funds from the Research Council of Norway. The intervention is an innovative combination of components designed to enable women to self-manage their depressive symptoms during the teachable moment of pregnancy, when intrinsic motivation for self-management is high. The intervention builds upon research about the specific needs of pregnant women,49 contributing to knowledge about adherence to and sustainability of self-management interventions for this real world population. This internet-based format allows for wide-ranging accessibility by and large reach to numerous individuals across all geographical regions of the US and Norway, with potential for cost-effectiveness and translatability compared to face-to-face approaches.14 The Mamma Mia intervention proposed in this application offers a potentially acceptable and easily sustainable prevention/ intervention modality for depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women.   This study entails multiple elements of innovation including: (1)  Evaluating a novel approach, the Mamma Mia internet-based intervention, for preventing and intervening in depressive symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women; (2)  Examining the effects of a supported internet-based intervention (Mamma Mia Plus) in attempts to decrease attrition; (3)  Using a pragmatic approach to intervention delivery and outcomes measurement (all internet-based), to minimize participant burden and decrease costs;  (4)  Collaborating with international colleagues to expand the potential reach and viability of the intervention; and, of effects of the intervention. (5)  Preparing for future large-scale hybrid implementation studies by exploring moderators and mediators  C. Approach C.1. Conceptual Framework: This project is built upon key concepts of the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory by Ryan and Sawin.43 Figure 1 illustrates the key concepts of this study, whereby Specific Aim 1 will test the effect of the intervention conditions on the primary outcome, Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of the intervention conditions on the secondary outcomes, and Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the process (mediators) and context (moderators) of the effects. This self-management theory is relevant to the topic of prevention/ intervention with perinatal depressive symptoms because of the premise that purposeful engagement in an intervention such as Mamma Mia may impact proximal (during pregnancy) and distal (postpartum) health outcomes, which include depressive symptoms, subjective well-being stress, anxiety, and engagement in SM behaviors. In a longitudinal study that contributed to the development of Mamma Mia, several factors arose as predictive of onset of postpartum depressive symptoms: self-efficacy, emotion self-regulation, and social support.51 Mamma Mia and Mamma Mia Plus are intended to enhance the process of self-management (intervention mediators in this study) by: (a) increasing knowledge about the perinatal period (e.g., modules on recognizing depressive symptoms, breastfeeding, parenting strategies) with the goal of resultant self-efficacy, (b) engaging participants in self-regulation strategies (e.g., modules on awareness of symptoms, reflective thinking, mindfulness practices), and, (c) enhancing feelings of social support (e.g., modules on communication with partners and clinicians, using resources for breastfeeding).17,51 Contextual factors will be explored as key moderators for the effects of the intervention, including demographics (e.g., age, race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education), parity, baseline depressive symptom score, and type of healthcare provider. In our studies, these factors have arisen as relevant to the natural development of perinatal depressive symptoms and/or as moderators of the effects of Mamma Mia: education and baseline depressive symptom score moderated the intervention effects in a previous RCT in Norway.16 In other studies, we found that age, socioeconomic status, and parity played a role in the development or recognition of perinatal depressive symptoms.3,52 Similarly, clinicians play a role in fostering self-management,43 thus type of clinician will be explored as a potential moderator.  C.2. Pilot Data In this proposal, we bring together a strong team of interprofessional scientists with rich experience in biobehavioral, self-management, and prevention/intervention research focused on depressive and related symptoms in the perinatal period. The proposal is also supported by the team's history of successful collaboration on multiple projects and the experience of the PI and Co-Investigators in leading complex, longitudinal biobehavioral studies. Collectively, the preliminary studies reported below support the following:  (a) the teams ability to successfully develop, implement, and evaluate the Mamma Mia intervention;  (b) the teams ability to successfully recruit and retain perinatal participants and evaluate biobehavioral effects of a self-management intervention; and,  (c) the teams experience in using internet-based intervention and data collection methods.   C.2.1. Preliminary Studies to Support the Implementation of the Mamma Mia intervention: As discussed in section A.3. above, the Mamma Mia intervention has been tested in several studies for feasibility, acceptability, and effects in Norwegian populations, including a RCT of n=1342 pregnant and postpartum women.1618 This most recent study demonstrated efficacy of the intervention on depressive symptoms; participants in Mamma Mia had lower depressive symptom scores at 37 weeks gestation (p=0.008) and 6 weeks postpartum (p=0.031), and depressive symptom score at baseline emerged as a moderator. In addition, the attrition rate was highest in women with a lower level of education and higher depressive symptom scores at baseline. Interviews with a sub-set of participants suggested that many women hoped for Mamma Mia to be integrated into typical prenatal care.53 In preparation for evaluating the effects in a U.S. population, we have recently conducted a pilot study to determine preliminary acceptability in n=100 pregnant and postpartum women. [INSERT RESULTS from IGP study HERE]  C.2.2. Preliminary Studies to Support Recruitment and Retention of Pregnant and Postpartum Women in Self-Management Intervention Studies: This intervention builds upon our previous studies of self-management interventions in samples of pregnant and non-pregnant women with depressive symptoms, with results to support feasibility, acceptability, and short- and long-term effects.5458 For example, preliminary results from the ongoing longitudinal study (NIH/NICHD R15HD086835; PI: Kinser) indicate that women participating in the Mindful Moms intervention (n=41) had a statistically significant decrease in depressive symptom scores (as measured by the PHQ-9) over time (F3, 25 = 39.16, p < 0.0001) and as compared to the archival comparison group. Drs. Kinser (PI), Jallo (Co-I), Thacker (Co-I), Huberty (Co-I), and Haga (Co-I) have a combined forty plus year history of relevant experience with the conduct of randomized controlled trials on health behavior and self-management interventions in various populations, including racially and socioeconomically diverse women of child-bearing age and pregnant/ postpartum women.16,59,60    C.2.3. Preliminary Studies to Support Experience with Internet-Based Intervention and Data Collection Methods: Drs. Jallo and Huberty (Co-Is) have experience with developing and testing internet-based mobile applications and collecting data via internet-based methods. Dr. Jallo developed an internet-based mobile device stress coping app to reduce stress in hospitalized pregnant women at risk for preterm birth. Study findings demonstrated a significant reduction in stress scores when comparing scores before and after listening suggesting a respite from the stress response.61 In 2009, Dr. Huberty began a partnership with Text4Baby, a free nationwide mobile health information service that delivers text messages to pregnant women. Using an iterative design, Huberty developed 160 physical activity-specific text messages62 then tested the effects of these messages for improving pregnant womens physical activity, compared to of a control group which received the standard Text4Baby messages. Dr. Huberty has federal funding through the NIH/NICHD for a study of an internet-based intervention for mothers after stillbirth (R34AT008808-03); with this study, she demonstrates proficiency in internet-based recruitment, enrollment, intervention delivery, and data collection. In addition to this study, she has extensive experience recruiting a range of participants for online interventions and has been successful at meeting recruitment goals in a timely manner.62,63  D. Research Design and Methods To evaluate the effects of Mamma Mia and the mediators/ moderators of its effects, we will conduct an international randomized controlled trial in which 1950 pregnant women in the U.S. who are <25 weeks gestation will be randomly assigned to Mamma Mia, to Mamma Mia Plus, or to the usual care (n=650 in each group); 493 women in Norway will be randomly assigned to the intervention groups. Our team has obtained a commitment of funding from the Research Council of Norway to support the research activities in Norway, on the condition that we can obtain NIH funding for the U.S.-based research activities. Hence the main focus of this application, with regards to study procedures and methods, will be on the U.S.-based activities.  D.1. Study Setting and Multi-Site Collaborative Plan: Recruitment will occur nationally throughout the U.S. and Norway, with recruitment hub sites in both countries. Two hub sites in the U.S. (Virginia Commonwealth University, Arizona State University) will be used to enhance recruitment efforts via collaborations with local health systems (see Letters of Support). One hub site in Norway (Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Eastern and Southern Norway) will enhance recruitment efforts via collaborations with publically-supported midwifery and public health nurse clinics. All data collection will occur via internet-based platforms (e.g., REDCap in English for the U.S. participants). In the first quarter of Year 1, the PI (Dr. Kinser) and site PIs (Drs. Huberty and Haga), along with key research team members, will meet in-person to refine the Manual of Operating Procedures (MOP) to facilitate study fidelity, including but not limited to consistency in study implementation and data collection across countries (further discussion of intervention fidelity below). The MOP will detail study procedures and describe study-specific documents to be used by both sites, including sections on study protocol, staff responsibilities, recruitment and retention plans, screening and eligibility criteria, informed consent process, study intervention, data and safety monitoring plan, study compliance, data collection and study forms, data management plan, quality control procedures, and study completion and close-out procedures. As PI, Dr. Kinser will maintain responsibility for finalizing elements of the MOP and ensuring consistent use by the site research teams.  D.2. Sample: Following IRB approval in the U.S. and Ethics Board in Norway, 1950 pregnant U.S. women and 493 pregnant Norwegian women will be recruited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria: (1) <25 weeks gestation; (2) age 18; (3) speak, read, and understand English or Norwegian; (4) have access to the internet and a working email address. Participants must have access to the internet because the intervention is internet-based. Participants must have a working email address because they will receive automated emails as reminders to engage in data collection. Participants in the U.S. must have a working phone number in the case that they are randomized to the Mamma Mia Plus arm which involves regular contacts by a registered nurse by phone (in Norway they will receive contacts by a registered nurse at their local health clinic).  D.3. Sample Size/ Power Analysis: A sample size of 1950 participants in the U.S. is proposed to detect a significant Group*Time interaction on the primary outcome of depressive symptom severity on the EPDS. This sample size was calculated using published data16 reflecting the changes seen for the Mama-Mia intervention vs the control condition on EPDS. These calculations incorporate the attrition seen in the published study. For the calculations, it was assumed that the Mamma Mia Plus group would see similar effects on EPDS as the Mamma Mia group but the attrition rate would be lower, more in line with what was seen for the control condition in the previous study (29.8% on the control condition vs 43.8% in the Mamma Mia group). These simulations were performed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) fit using a mixed linear model (MLM). The model included one between subjects factor, Group (Control, Mamma-Mia, Mamma-Mia Plus), one within subject factor, Time (baseline, 25 weeks gestation, 37 weeks gestation, 6 weeks postpartum, 3 months postpartum, and 6 months postpartum), and the interaction between Group and Time. The variance-covariance structure was model using a spatial power structure to accommodate the non-uniform time measurements, assuming a correlation of 0.50. With these assumptions along with a desired  = 0.05 significance level, 650 subject per group (1,950 total in the U.S.) yielded a power of over 80% to detect a significant Group by Time interaction.  The Norway sample size was calculated separately because the site will use cluster randomization due to unique requirements in the prenatal care system; briefly, adjusting for the previously observed 37% overall attrition rate, a total sample size will be 493, using clinics as randomization units at the cluster level with estimated average cluster sizes of 15 participants, for an 80% chance to detect moderately large effect sizes of 0.50, assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, as observed in previous cluster trials on postpartum depression, 5 measurement occasions, a two-tailed 5% alpha level, and 24 clinics at the outset.

FP00018741_Res1,70,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  Self-reported sugars consumption is associated with considerable measurement error leading to inconsistent findings  from  population  studies  on  sugars  and  chronic  disease  risk.  Sucrose  and  fructose  in  24-h  urine  is currently being investigated in the U.S. as an objective measure of sugars intake, under highly controlled feeding conditions  (U01-CA197902;  PI  Tasevska  N).  Yet,  this  biomarker  reflects  total  sugars  intake  and  does  not distinguish between sugars found in fruits and vegetables [i.e., naturally-occurring sugars (NOS)] and added sugars (AS) from processed foods and beverages.  AS from energy dense, nutrient depleted foods may have more  pronounced  adverse  metabolic  effects  as  they  are  readily  available  to  enter  metabolic  pathways. Metabolomics, which simultaneously detects alterations in hundreds of metabolites, promises novel avenues for discovering combinations of biomarkers that can capture the complexities of diet. The aim of this application is to identify candidate metabolomic profiles as potential exposure biomarkers of NOS and AS intake. For this application, we propose to use data and biological samples from a recently completed 15-day controlled feeding study with 100 participants consuming their usual diet, and collecting multiple 24-h urine and blood samples (U01-CA197902; PI Tasevska N; statistical analysis in progress) to identify candidate metabolomic profiles specific of NOS vs. AS intake. Out of 100 participants, we will identify 50 participants with extreme levels of NOS and 50 with extreme levels of AS intake (top and bottom 25% of their 15-d mean intake distribution). Extreme phenotype sampling (i.e., selecting samples with extreme values of a continuous trait) has been proven effective in increasing statistical power of association studies, while participants highly controlled yet varied diet will allow detection of a variety of metabolomic signatures associated with a wide range of food sources of NOS and AS, rather than metabolomic signatures of a few select foods. Two plasma samples per participant collected before and at the end of the 15-d feeding period, and three nonconsecutive 24-h urine samples collected over the 15-d feeding period will be analyzed. Availability of multiple urine and blood samples per participant will enable investigation of the reproducibility of the identified metabolomic fingerprints and identification of consistent metabolomic profiles. We will use state-of-the-art untargeted metabolomic profiling methods and platforms to measure >2,000 MS signals of aqueous metabolites and lipids that can be reliably detected in human biofluids. A two-phase statistical-learning and machine-learning hybrid approach will be applied to construct metabolic fingerprints of sugars intake in plasma and urine matrices. We hypothesize that certain sets of metabolites will be  highly  specific  of  NOS  and  AS  intake,  in  human  blood  and/or  urine  samples.  Finally,  we  will  explore approaches for combining urine and blood metabolic fingerprints to generate an improved integrated measure of intake. Development of unbiased measures of AS consumption is key for elucidating the role of AS in chronic disease risk and for evaluating the impact of public health initiatives for reducing AS consumption in the U.S.   ",
FP00018764_Res1,71,,,,,1,,,"RESEARCH STRATEGY Overview We propose to examine the efficacy of an eight-week smartphone-based meditation intervention with a 20-week follow-up  (from baseline) for reducing sleep disturbance (primary outcome), fatigue, emotional  symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depression), and inflammation  (measured by levels of TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, PAL1, RANTES, and CRP)  (secondary  outcomes)  among  male  and  female  myeloproliferative  neoplasm  (MPN)  patients.  Our randomized control trial (RCT) will test an existing consumer-based app, Calm, compared with a health education podcast (POD) active control. Participants (N=210) will be recruited to an app-based wellness study, and will engage in either >10 min/day of mindfulness meditation  via Calm (n=105) or an equivalent amount of time with a health  education  podcast (n=105). Our research team  includes experts in  clinical  trials,  mindfulness-based interventions,  app  engagement,  behavioral  sleep  medicine,  actigraphy,  inflammatory  outcomes,  and  MPN symptomatology and management. This study has the potential  to provide support for the use of Calm as a non-pharmacologic  intervention  to  accompany traditional  therapy for MPN  patients.  Due  to  the common  disease course shared by MPN and other hematological malignancies,  study findings  may extend impact to the larger cancer community.  Scientific premises:   Even with optimally  directed MPN therapy, the burden of long-term sleep disturbance among MPN patients  is  high  and  often  left  unaddressed.  Current  sleep  pharmacologic  therapies  do  not  fully  alleviate  sleep disturbances and are accompanied by the risk of long-term dependence and side effects.     Fatigue, depression, anxiety, and inflammation  are related to sleep disturbance in cancer patients. However, causal relationships between these factors are not fully understood.    Mindfulness  meditation,  as  an  adjunct  to  medical  treatment,  may  reduce  sleep  disturbance,  fatigue, emotional  symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression), and inflammation  in  patients with cancer, including  MPNs. There  has  been  a  small  body  of  literature  that  has  shown  meditation  and  other  mindfulness-based interventions  may lead  to  improvements  in  sleep  disturbances among  cancer patients  (primarily  breast cancer). However, no RCTs have yet examined the  effects of meditation  on sleep disturbance in patients  with hematological  cancers, such as MPN. This highlights  the need for this study as it will  be the first of its kind in a rare and under-researched hematological  cancer population  (i.e., MPN patients). In-person interventions can be burdensome and inaccessible to a geographically  dispersed population  like MPN patients. Widely available  consumer-based apps may help patients overcome this obstacle. However, there is a  lack of empirical  research on  meditation  app  use among  cancer patients.  We  will  use an RCT designed  to rigorously study a widely  available  consumer-based app,  i.e.,  Calm,  and its  ability  to reduce sleep disturbance in MPN patients.   We  have demonstrated promising  effects on sleep  disturbance in  MPN patients  in  a four-week feasibility study; therefore we are taking the next steps to conduct an efficacy study that will utilize a larger sample, include measures of secondary outcomes (i.e., fatigue, anxiety, depression, inflammation),  employ an active control group, and study sustainability over 20 weeks.   A. SIGNIFICANCE A.1. Sleep disturbance is a long term and serious problem for MPN patients. Up to 75% of cancer patients report sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling  asleep, difficulty staying asleep, nonrestorative sleep, insomnia),1 a rate twice as high as the general population.1 MPNs (e.g., polycythemia vera [PV], essential thrombocythemia [ET], myelofibrosis [MF]) are a unique  and particularly rare (prevalence of ~350,000  in  the United  States and incidence rate of ~6/100,000  per year) subgroup of hematological  malignancies  characterized by a chronic and severe symptom  burden.2  As  such,  MPNs  are  geographically  dispersed  which  creates  challenges  for  local programs to help  with  symptom management.  Thus, MPN  patients  are understudied and  often  underserved. Common MPN symptoms include fatigue,  insomnia, night sweats, bone pain, itching, and inactivity. Up to 65% of MPN patients report sleep disturbances.2 A recent analysis of 858 MPN patients revealed that ~52% reported difficulties staying asleep, ~38% reported difficulties falling asleep, ~31% reported insomnia, and ~19% reported sleeping too much.3 Sleep disturbance in MPN patients is related to poorer emotional  functioning  (r=-0.47) and worsened total  symptom burden (r=0.55), including  increased fatigue (r=0.45), depressive symptoms (r=0.52), night sweats (r=0.41), and tingling in the extremities (r=0.40) as measured with the MPN-SAF TSS (all significant at p<0.001).4 Sleep disturbance is also associated with particular inflammatory cytokines (i.e., PAL1, RANTES) in MPN  patients.5 It is important  to note that sleep disturbances can persist in  cancer survivors for months or years after ending  treatment.6 Because more than 60% of patients survive up to 15 years after a diagnosis of   RESEARCH STRATEGY Overview We propose to examine the efficacy of an eight-week smartphone-based meditation intervention with a 20-week follow-up (from baseline) for reducing sleep disturbance (primary outcome), fatigue, emotional symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depression), and inflammation (measured by levels of TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, PAL1, RANTES, and CRP)  (secondary  outcomes)  among  male  and  female  myeloproliferative  neoplasm  (MPN)  patients.

Up to 65% of MPN patients report sleep disturbances.2 A recent analysis of 858 MPN patients revealed that ~52% reported difficulties staying asleep, ~38% reported difficulties falling asleep, ~31% reported insomnia, and ~19% reported sleeping too much.3 Sleep disturbance in MPN patients is related to poorer emotional functioning (r=-0.47) and worsened total symptom burden (r=0.55), including increased fatigue (r=0.45), depressive symptoms (r=0.52), night sweats (r=0.41), and tingling in the extremities (r=0.40) as measured with the MPN-SAF TSS (all significant at p<0.001).4 Sleep disturbance is also associated with particular inflammatory cytokines (i.e., PAL1, RANTES) in MPN patients.5 It is important to note that sleep disturbances can persist in cancer survivors for months or years after ending treatment.6 Because more than 60% of patients survive up to 15 years after a diagnosis of MPN, some achieving relatively normal life expectancies, MPN patients are particularly in need of long-term sleep disturbance management.7,8   A.2. MPN patients lack effective, long term treatment options for sleep disturbance. Medications are the most commonly prescribed therapy for sleep disturbed patients with all forms of cancer; In a recent survey of 858 MPN patients, 81% reported using medication to treat sleep disturbance.3 however, medications often come with side effects and risks of long-term dependence.9 Moreover, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that treating sleep disturbance with medication in cancer patients is truly effective.1,10 Non-pharmacologic, particularly behavioral, interventions are attractive strategies to treat sleep disturbance due to their 1) limited to no side effects, 2) targeting of cognitive and behavioral aspects that reduce sleep disturbances, and 3) potential for long-lasting effects.11 Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the most available evidence-based, non-pharmacologic treatment strategy to manage sleep disturbances in cancer patients and survivors.12 However, this treatment modality is time-consuming and intensive, requiring patients to frequently meet in-person with therapists and physicians at sites/clinics.10 This  approach may not be sustainable in the long term, as cancer patients  often  report  barriers  to  attending  in-person  interventions,  including  fatigue,  transportation,  and scheduling  difficulties.13  Although  remote  delivery  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  for  insomnia  has  been suggested as an alternative,12 only a single pilot study has investigated this possibility. The pilot study delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia via a mobile app, but was limited by the small sample size (n=19) and no control group.14 Up to 65% of MPN patients report sleep disturbance, yet there have been no interventions for sleep disturbance in this population. Thus, there is a need for effective, easily accessible, non-pharmacologic interventions to treat long-term sleep disturbances in MPN patients.  A.3. Meditation leads to multiple positive outcomes associated with sleep, potentially resulting in greater impact on sleep disturbance. Mindfulness meditation has gained increasing attention as a complementary behavioral  therapy for  cancer  patients,  particularly  for  sleep  disturbances.15-18  Mindfulness  meditation  is  the practice of moment-to-moment awareness, in which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgment.19 Some data suggest a link between increased fatigue and increased prevalence and severity of sleep disturbances.4 Accordingly, research suggests that mindfulness meditation (hereinafter referred to as meditation) may exert bi-directional effects on both sleep disturbance and fatigue. In other words, meditation may reduce sleep disturbance through reductions in fatigue, and vice versa. Our formative work examining meditation among MPN  patients  demonstrated  preliminary  improvements  in  both  fatigue  and  sleep  disturbances  with  patients reporting they thought their reductions in fatigue was due to better sleep quality.20,23  Meditation has also been shown to reduce sleep disturbance through reductions in emotional distress (e.g., anxiety,  depression)15  and  reductions  in  sleep-interfering  cognitive  processes  (e.g.,  continuous,  ruminating thoughts and worries).17 For example, presleep thought processes and behaviors may play an exacerbating role in  insomnia.  Those  that  have  difficulty  falling asleep  or  going  back to sleep have higher  states of presleep arousal, stress, and worry, and are more affected by life stressors compared to those not sleep disturbed.24 Mindfulness meditation may reduce stress, worry, and intrusive thoughts, which may  reduce sleep disturbance.25 Inflammation is a key component to the overall symptom burden in MPN patients. Symptom burden has been shown to be related specifically to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8)5 and systemic markers of inflammation (i.e., C-reactive protein [CRP]).26 Sleep disturbances have been associated with higher levels of IL-6 and CRP in healthy adults,27 and PAL1 and RANTES in MPN patients.5,28 However, the understanding of the general relationship between sleep disturbances and inflammation is not fully developed. Recent work has suggested that sleep disturbances may cause a proinflammatory shift in systemic inflammatory cytokine  signaling  (possibly  through  effects  on  the  ANS  and  HPA  axis),  ultimately  leading  to  increases  in inflammation.27 A study indicated that as sleep quality improved in MPNs, PAL1 and RANTES decreased.28 There have been no studies investigating the effects of meditation for sleep disturbance and inflammation in MPN patients, despite cross-sectional evidence suggesting that there may be positive effects of meditation on both.29 A small body of evidence suggests that meditation reduces inflammatory cytokine production and CRP in both solid tumor cancer patients (e.g., breast) and non-cancerous adults.30,31 As well, preliminary evidence on meditation effects suggests that as the number of meditation sessions per week increases, inflammatory markers (i.e., IL-6) are reduced in both solid tumor cancer patients and non-cancerous adults.30,32 It is postulated that the calming effects of meditation on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may reduce proinflammatory gene expression and signaling via the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kB.30,33 This will be the first study to examine the concurrent effects of meditation on sleep disturbance and inflammation (i.e., PAL1, RANTES) in MPN patients. If positive results are found, the relationship between these two outcomes could be tested in future trials.     A.4. Current meditation interventions do not meet patients diverse and unique needs, thus more flexible options are needed.  Although the Society for Integrative Oncology Clinical Practice Guidelines34 suggests that meditation  is  a  safe  technique  to  decrease  the  burden  of  a  variety  of  cancer-related  symptoms  and  co-morbidities, uptake is limited in several ways. First, meditation has typically been delivered by trained clinicians through in-person visits,35 which limits its accessibility and utilization especially in a rare and geographically dispersed cancer population such as MPN patients. MPN patients often have to seek treatment outside of their home city or state due to a lack of specialized treatment centers nearby. In our previous work, only 64% (n=18/28) of patients received their specialty care in the state in which they resided, and only 29% (n=8/28) received their specialty care in the same city.36 Second, traditional in-person meditation programs are often burdensome (e.g., 90 minute sessions, once a week for eight weeks). Patients with a high symptom burden may not be able to engage  in  such  long  sessions.37  Further,  the  interventions  are not  supportive  of  long-term  lifestyle  change. Whether in-person or digital, programs require attendance to a specific schedule, which limits uptake. Because meditation is shown to significantly benefit cancer patients, effective modes of delivering meditation interventions on a flexible and sustainable schedule need to be developed to ensure that patients are receiving these benefits.  A.5. Smartphone apps have great potential to deliver meditation interventions, but more rigorous studies are needed. Smartphone apps have attracted considerable interest from patients as a means of promoting self-management of chronic disease for better health outcomes.38-40 In a recent survey of 1,300 cancer patients, 71% reported owning a mobile smartphone.39 A 2018 survey of 631 cancer patients demonstrated that 74% regularly use a smartphone, and 39% expressed an interest in supportive care information via mobile apps.40 In our pilot work, 97% (n=308/318) of MPN patients indicated that they owned a smartphone and were willing to download a mobile app to participate in a meditation app study. We recently (April 2019) conducted a search for mobile apps in the Google Play and Apple App store that were intended for cancer patients/survivors. Despite ~50 mobile apps marketed for this population that offered mostly educational content and information for caregivers, only four included some form of meditation, none of which were rigorously evaluated for their feasibility or effects on cancer patients/survivors.41,42 A systematic review by Jongerius et al.43 identified only two meditation studies for  cancer  patients  delivered  via  mobile  apps,  both  focusing  on  breast  cancer  patients.  One  study  used  a consumer-based app, Headspace, but did not track app utilization.44 The other study was not specifically a mobile app, instead adapting Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for iPad delivery, and was conducted only over six-weeks without any follow-up.45 Our study will innovatively use the widely available consumer-based app, Calm, to deliver a meditation intervention to male and female MPN patients. If proven effective, Calm has the broad reach,  popularity,  and  commercial  sustainability  to  deliver  meditation  across  cancer  types  (e.g.,  those  with common disease course, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, long-lived solid tumor patients with controlled metastatic disease) and clinics.  B. INNOVATION B.1. This is the first study to determine the effects of a complementary, non-pharmacologic approach (i.e., meditation) on sleep disturbance in MPN patients. The extended disease course of MPN leads to high symptom burden, including sleep disturbances, that persists despite best available pharmacologic therapy.Yet, there have been no interventions for this population that targets sleep disturbance. Most existing data related to meditation in cancer is either in solid tumor survivors with minimal residual disease, such as breast cancer post-treatment, or those with short survival, including metastatic solid tumor patients.46-51 MPN patients are rare, have a disease course different from solid tumor cancers but with shared symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, fatigue, emotional distress), afflict men and women almost equally, are geographically dispersed in both urban and rural areas located at various distances from cancer centers. The geographic dispersion of such a small group of cancer patients provides little opportunity for programs to help with the management of symptoms in the local community.  Because  of  this,  MPNs  are  often  understudied  and  underserved.  Many  chronic  hematologic malignancy  patients,  like  MPNs,  share  a  common  disease  course  with  unique  characteristics  that  warrant specific study. 52-54 B.2. We are advancing methods to provide complementary approaches for managing sleep disturbance in  cancer patients by taking advantage of an already-developed, commercially available mobile app. The use  of  mobile  health  tools  has  been  suggested  as  a  means  of  increasing  the  scalability  of  behavioral interventions, thereby allowing a wider reach.55 One study recommended online mindfulness-based meditation to provide an opportunity for participation unavailable to some patients, including underserved cancer survivors.56 A recent review of four studies that previously used mobile apps with cancer patients cited numerous potential benefits, including increased access to self-management strategies, educational resources, and peer support.57 Despite the growth and promise of using mobile apps to deliver interventions, most apps are investigator initiated   and  developed  within  the  context  of  specific  research,58  thus  their  wide-spread  commercial  viability  is  not guaranteed. There is a lack of evidence supporting consumer-based mobile apps to improve cancer symptoms.  Leveraging widely available products like Calm provide researchers and clinicians with an established platform to disseminate smartphone-based meditation to MPN patients. Calm is an easily accessible (across smartphone platforms  Android  and  iPhone),  low  cost  ($13/month  or  $60/year),  membership-based  meditation  app.  It  is currently the most popular meditation app, with over 1.8 million paying users and 50 million downloads.59 Calm was named the Best Meditation App of 2016 and 2017 by Healthline.com and Huffington Post, respectively,60 and was named Apples App of the Year in 2017.59 Notably, Calm was developed based on clinical stress reduction theories, giving the app a valid scientific foundation. This study will be the first RCT using Calm for sleep disturbance in MPNs. We will also be the first to explore whether meditation delivered using a consumer-based mobile app like Calm provides self-reported benefits and biological changes in inflammation similar to those observed in in-person, more comprehensive (and more burdensome) programs.38,61  B.3. We are improving study design by employing an effective active control intervention. As noted, there is limited research examining the effects of meditation apps (especially consumer-based apps), and research to date utilizes either no or weak control conditions. We have designed and pretested a health education podcast control condition for feasibility that is approximately equal to the Calm intervention in terms of time, attention, and app engagement. Thus, we will be able to demonstrate with greater confidence that the causal mechanism is the meditation experience specific to the Calm group. This greatly improves the study rigor and our ability to isolate efficacy in the outcomes.  B.4. We will explore whether MPN patients establish a lifestyle habit to manage sleep disturbance. We will be one of the first studies to test the sustained effects (20-week follow-up) of a consumer-based meditation app on sleep disturbance in cancer patients, specifically MPN patients. Studies using meditation to reduce sleep disturbance  have  not  had  follow-up  periods  beyond 12  weeks.17  Calm  is available  for  a  relatively  small  fee ($13/month or $60/year) and can be used whenever a patient desires and/or feels it is needed (i.e., when they feel overwhelmed, fatigued, anxious, etc.). Because Calm is consumer-based, the intervention never truly ends. The patient can control when and how frequently Calm is used, potentially increasing the likelihood that MPN patients will utilize Calm to alleviate sleep disturbance in the long-term.   C. APPROACH C.1. Overview. We will conduct an RCT of an eight-week smartphone-based meditation intervention (Calm) among male and female MPN patients (N=210). Specifically, we will test the apps efficacy over eight weeks to determine whether use of the app reduces sleep disturbance (primary outcome), fatigue, emotional distress (i.e., anxiety, depression), and inflammatory markers (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CRP, PAL1, RANTES). We will also explore the sustained effects (20 weeks) of Calm in MPN patients (e.g., sleep disturbance, fatigue, emotional distress, and inflammatory markers). Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention (Calm) or control group (POD), and matched for attention, time, and dose. Sex as a biological variable: We will include men and women  in  equal  proportion  to  the  prevalence data for MPN (~49% women and ~51% men).  Reproducibility and Transparency: We will use a  clearly  articulated  and  documented  study design  and  make our  study  protocols  publicly available  on  study  websites  and through research publications. De-identified data will be made  available  upon to  other investigators interested in publishing secondary data analyses. We will share aggregated results with  interested  participants  and  community/clinic  organizations,  as  appropriate.  Our  data  will  be  curated  in REDCap for timely and accurate sharing/analysis. The Calm app is publically available.  C.2. Research Team. We have a strong, interdisciplinary research team with the varied expertise required to conduct this study. (Table 1; Biosketches).  C.3. Preliminary Studies.  We have conducted cross-sectional surveys of MPN patients characterizing the prevalence and severity of sleep disturbance.2,3 Up to 65% of MPN patients reported sleep disturbance,2 and we have identified sleep disturbance as a common and significant problem related to a reported increase in negative symptom outcomes.4 Mind-body interventions MPN pathology Sleep disturbance (measurement (e.g., actigraphy, sleep diaries) and evaluation) MPN symptom management (fatigue, emotional distress) Inflammation Intervention design, delivery, & evaluation Biostats Table 1.

We have partnered with Calm for over five years, and recently conducted a four-week beta test to examine the feasibility of using Calm (compared to another meditative app or education control) to deliver daily meditation to MPN patients. This test also explored the preliminary effects of Calm use on MPN patient symptoms.20. MPN patients recruited online were randomly assigned to two of three groups that were paired back-to-back for a duration of 4-weeks, for a total study duration of eight weeks. One group was assigned to Calm, a second group used 10% Happier (another consumer-based meditation app), and a third group received an educational handout (describing evidence-based, fatigue-reducing, non-pharmacologic strategies). MPN patients in the Calm (n=96) and 10% Happier (n=100) groups were asked to meditate for approximately 10 minutes per day for four weeks. Feasibility questionnaires were completed at baseline and after each four-week group assignment (weeks four and eight). These examined acceptability (satisfaction, intent to continue use, safety), demand (adherence, daily meditation minutes provided by Calm), practicality (ability to complete questionnaires), and limited-efficacy testing (effect sizes of meditation on symptoms). In qualitative interviews (N=48) conducted post-intervention, participants reported a preference for Calm (77%) over the 10% Happier app. Furthermore, specific to Calm, participants reported the sleep-focused meditations were particularly helpful, producing better sleep. Half of those in the qualitative interviews (n=24) reported more ease in falling asleep, better quality of sleep, and better management of stress or anxiety. Participants also particularly liked (a) the variety and flexibility of the app, (b) the wide range of meditations available on the app, (c) the ability of the meditations to put them in a calm or relaxed state, (d) the format and ease of use of the app, (e) the narrators voice (i.e., it was calming or soothing), (f) the appropriateness of instruction for beginners, and (g) the concise nature of the meditations (i.e., 10-12 min in length). Completion rates were similar for each of the two meditation apps (73% for Calm and 76% for 10% Happier). Although 70 minutes of meditation was prescribed for both groups, Calm displayed superior adherence to prescription; for Calm, weekly meditation participation averaged ~71 min/week where 10% Happier had ~31 min/week. For completers, Calm appeared to be more acceptable than the 10% Happier app, with 83% vs. 61% using the app, 84% vs. 66% satisfied with the content, and 97% vs. 77% willing to recommend the app to others. Preliminary findings demonstrated a moderate effect on sleep disturbance (d=-0.47 and d=-0.40 for Calm and 10% Happier, respectively). Achieving these results after only four weeks of daily, 10-minute meditation participation shows promise for an eight-week study. This plan follows the example of other studies, which use a one to four week study to determine feasibility/proof of concept, then use these findings to inform longer trials (i.e., larger scale RCTs).62,63 For example, Anguera et al.62 recently tested the feasibility of a 4-week mobile iPad intervention (EVO) to improve depression symptoms in older adults. EVO was shown to be feasible in the 4-week study, and tested for its effects in a 12-week RCT.  Meditative  movement  to  reduce  inflammation  in MPN  patients.  We  conducted  an online  yoga pilot  study  in 2016/2017 in which MPN patients were asked to participate in 60 min of online yoga (including small amounts of meditation) for 12 weeks. Among other improvements in symptom burden, MPN patients saw a large pre-to-post intervention reduction in TNF-a (d=-0.87) and a small pre-post reduction in IL-6 (d=-0.26).64 Although this is  not  a  specific  meditation  intervention,  the  pilot  study  included  meditative  aspects  expected  to  reduce inflammatory markers consistent with other research.30-32 Actigraphic and  self-reported  sleep assessment  to  measure objective and  perceived  sleep.  In  our  previous studies across lifespan (i.e., infants to older adults) and among vulnerable populations (e.g., minors, chronic pain, insomnia, and obstructive sleep apnea patients, pregnant women), Co-I Petrov and our team successfully collected prospective sleep assessments using continuous wrist actigraphy and daily diaries to measure sleep and circadian rhythm parameters.65-67 Assessment periods for wrist actigraphy were typically one to three weeks in duration with high rates (70-98%) of valid, complete data retrieved (i.e., minimum of five of seven nights; 10 of 14 nights; 15 of 21 nights). Our experience with these studies led to streamlined protocols that allow for ease in shipping wrist actigraphs and diaries to and from participants with minimal loss of data or equipment, and scoring, analysis, and interpretation of multiple sleep parameters over time.

FP00018846_Res1,73,,,,,1,,,"Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among Americans =65 years old with 5.7 million sufferers and an annual treatment cost estimated at $39.2 billion. The prevalence of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is growing rapidly and accounts for most incident HF cases. Theres a growing need to improve treatment strategies for HFpEF as highlighted by recent data indicating dismal outcomes (5-yr mortality 75.7%; 5yr hospital readmission rate, 84%) in these patients. This disease is characterized by significant cardiac and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Drug therapies for HFpEF have likely failed to improve outcomes such as exercise tolerance (VO2peak; an important predictor of mortality) in these patients due to lack of multi-system activity. Exercise training shows promise for improving these abnormalities that drive low VO2peak in these patients. Specifically, the applicants have demonstrated the utility of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at improving VO2peak, reversing cardiac dysfunction and maintaining skeletal muscle growth, structure and function. The applicants have also demonstrated the utility of essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation for improving skeletal muscle function in older adults. HIIT is a safe and potent exercise prescription. We recently demonstrated the superiority of HIIT compared to moderate intensity exercise in HFpEF patients. Specifically, HIIT improved VO2peak, diastolic function and ventricular mechanics in overweight and obese patients (mean age, 70 years) with HFpEF after just 12 training sessions over one month. Importantly, the effects of HIIT could be enhanced by the administration of strategic amino acid supplementation. Sustained improvements (or prevention of deterioration) in VO2peak and diastolic function have considerable clinical relevance because VO2peak and diastolic function are associated with morbidity and mortality in HFpEF. The optimal dose of exercise to improve exercise tolerance remains understudied in this older patient population. We propose a clinical trial that expands on our previous work by mechanistically exploring exercise training-mediated improvements in VO2peak through assessment of central (cardiac) and peripheral (muscle) parameters. This proposal is also designed to examine mechanisms of exercise response/non-response in this population. We broadly plan to examine the impact of HIIT and EAA supplementation versus HIIT + placebo, EAA + attention control and attention control + placebo on VO2peak and diastolic function. We will also identify cardiac and skeletal muscle markers that mediate improvements in VO2peak.",
FP00018867_Res1,74,,,,,1,,,"    Project Summary The long-term goal of this research is to understand the functional organization of auditory cortex for effective communication in real-life environments, which often demand successful sound-source identification and segregation. As a sound wave travels through space and reaches the ear canals, the acoustic features of a sound source (e.g., timbre) are altered by pinnae-filtering, which attenuates and amplifies the incoming sound waves in a frequency-specific and location-dependent manner. This poses a unique challenge for the auditory system  separating the source-related and location-related spectral information while keeping their representations without losing either set of information. Although the higher-order auditory system contains two major, dissociated processing streams  the so-called spatial localization ('where') and object-recognition ('what') pathways, the underlying mechanisms that enable this disassociation remain unknown. This proposal will investigate these mechanisms in the primary auditory cortex (A1), which projects information to both what and where pathways. The study is motivated by the premise that A1 neurons simultaneously encode the fundamental sound features of frequency, intensity, and location. This tuning structure might function as a multiplexing coding scheme and allow the same neural network to integrate and separate sound features in preparation for the next stage of 'what' and 'where' processing. We aim to identify these mechanisms by making extracellular recording measurements in A1 and an adjacent, secondary caudal medial and lateral field (CM/CL), which is considered the initial stage of the 'where' pathway. Aim 1 will investigate how single A1 neurons encode frequency-intensity-location multi-dimensional information and how sound location influences spectral processing, and will determine the contributions of different cell types and their connections to observed data by using neuron and microcircuit models. Aim 2 will investigate functional differences between the caudal where field and A1 in encoding frequency-intensity-location multi-dimensional information and how the spectral content of sounds affects spatial coding by single neurons, and will identify the anatomical projection patterns of excitatory afferents to the caudal field using viral-tracing technology. Unlike laboratory settings, real environments contain sensory information that is both dynamic and rich; the auditory system must integrate and separate the features of different sound sources. This ability is severely  compromised  after  hearing  impairment.  The  expected  outcomes  of  this  research  will  provide information about how neural processes in auditory cortex contribute to a stable perception of the acoustic environment.  Understanding  these  issues  will  help  improve  our  understanding  of  potential  computational sources of perceptual impairment. ",

FP00018915_Res1,76,,,,,1,,,"U PITT SPECIFIC AIMS (ASU SOW directly below)  Title:  Implementing  consensus-based  algorithms  to  address  opioid  misuse  behaviors  among  individuals prescribed long-term opioid therapy: developing implementation strategies and pilot testing  PI: Jessica Merlin, MD, PhD  The overall objectives for this application are two-fold. First, when addressing a problem such as opioid misuse behaviors that leaves patients particularly susceptible to harms, it is important to refine treatment approaches in pre-clinical settings when possible. Therefore, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR),16  we  will  identify  and  operationalize  algorithm  implementation  strategies  by  synthesizing  input  from primary care providers (PCPs) who gain hands-on experience with the algorithms  using standardized patient (SP)  interactions.  Second,  we  will  conduct  a  feasibility  pilot  of  the  algorithms  in  preparation  for  a  full-scale effectiveness-implementation  hybrid  trial  study.  This  work  will  advance  the  field  by  giving  PCPs  the  tools necessary to address concerning behaviors. To attain our objectives, we will pursue these Specific Aims:  Aim 1: To a) identify and b) operationalize implementation strategies for the algorithms.  Aim 1a approach: We will recruit 36 PCPs who will i) receive a brief training in how to use the algorithms, ii) engage in mock real-world interactions with standardized patient actors (SPs) who will portray the 6 concerning behaviors to provide hands-on experience with algorithm use, and iii) participate in group interviews on strategies they would use to implement these algorithms in their practices. Across the 6 behaviors/algorithms, we will create 23  cases  that  represent  all  possible  branch  points  (Table  4).  Investigators  will  develop  SP  cases  using  a systematic, iterative process. To allow each algorithm to be tested by at least 3 PCPs, thirty-six PCPs will be recruited from the 500+ PCPs at UPMC community practices. SP-PCP interactions will be followed by CFIR-based group interviews with the PCPs to gather information regarding optimal factors for implementation. We will  also  ask  about  Expert  Recommendations  for  Implementing  Change  (ERIC)-derived  implementation strategies,17 including conducting educational outreach visits, identifying early adopters, and developing a formal implementation  blueprint.  Given  the  ubiquity  of  electronic  health  record  (EHRs)-based  interventions,  we anticipate  implementation  will  involve  integration  of  the  algorithms  into  the  EHR,  including  clinical  decision support (CDS).  Aim  1b  approach:  We  will  operationalize  our  findings  from  Aim  1a.  We  are  prepared  to  develop  an  EHR integration and CDS plan as a part of our implementation strategy, but will also be flexible pending Aim 1 findings. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot trial of the algorithms. Approach: Guided by the Aim 1b CFIR-based implementation plan, we will conduct a pilot trial to investigate the algorithms feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness. We will conduct the pilot in 4 UPMC practices. We will randomize by site and use  a waitlist control to allow collection of pilot data from all 4 sites. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed qualitatively and via provider survey.  Preliminary  effectiveness  outcomes  will  include  reduction  in  concerning  behaviors  and  increased diagnosis/treatment of OUD. We will pilot EHR-based outcomes assessment.  We will then apply for an R01 to evaluate the intervention in a cluster-randomized effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial, which would prepare us to quickly scale the algorithms for widespread use. This would meet our long-term goal to reduce opioid misuse-related harms and diminish their impact on the opioid epidemic.   ASU Statement of Work  Dr. Greens primary role will be to ensure that the design and protocol of the simulations meet the needs of the first specific aim. Namely, she will oversee the creation of simulation cases and modified Delphi review to ensure the cases are appropriate for the 8 algorithms.  She will also participate in a video review of the SP-PCP interaction to determine what could have gone better and determine any implications for algorithm implementation.    ",
FP00018939_Rev1,77,,,,,1,,,"Abstract: In any pandemic, such as COVID-19, we have two responsibilities: check the spread of the virus by identifying and separating infected from uninfected individuals, and mitigate the reoccurrence by tracking community spread. Here we take a two-pronged approach to address both unmet needs:  a) to identify infected individuals, we will develop a low-cost point-of-care (LCPOC) test that detects human coronaviruses (HCoV) and provides visible test results within 30 minutes; and b) a HCoV-Multiplex In Solution Protein Array (MISPA), a serological assay to track and trace individuals based on their immune responses, with and without any clinical symptoms. We will employ our LCPOC strategy that utilizes programmable RNA sensors called toehold switches that detect virtually any nucleic acid sequence and freeze-dried cell-free transcription and translation reagents for deployment of sensors to the field with year-long shelf-life that can be used in places without the need for specialized equipment. This succeeded in testing for Zika virus at clinically relevant concentrations (20 aM) from viremic plasma for ~$3 per test. Our barcoded liquid protein array will enable quantitative serology simultaneously to all of the proteins from all known HCoVs. This will allow detection of (previously) infected individuals who no longer shed virus and addressing whether responses to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins predict clinical course, severity, duration, contagiousness and cross reactivity. Publications and preliminary data make this work likely to succeed. In addition to developing these tests, we will establish limits of detection (LoD), limits of quantification (LoQ) and validate the performance of both assays using clinical samples from our collaborators at the Mayo Clinic and at the Department of Laboratory Sciences and Infectious Diseases, Gemelli Hospital, Rome, Italy.

FP00019279,79,,,,,1,,,"DRAFT Learning Collaborative for Adult and Pediatric Behavioral Health and Physical Health Providers in AHCCCS Targeted Investments Program Pre-Proposal to the Arizona Association of Health Plans Presented by Arizona State University William Riley, PhD George Runger, PhD June 4th, 2019     1               Executive Summary  This project proposes that the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) sponsor a Learning Collaborative (LC) for the provider groups participating in the Targeted Investments Program (TIP). The purpose of the LC is to optimize integration of primary care and behavioral health to maximize and sustain milestone performance by the provider groups  The TIP initiative is an innovative program design by AHCCCS to offer financial incentives to primary care and behavioral health providers to develop integrated care systems. The aim of TIP is to improve provider integration and care coordination, decrease fragmentation, and provide whole person care for members with behavioral needs. The TIP has established a comprehensive set of core components and milestones that must be accomplished to achieve physical health and behavioral health integration goals to thereby be eligible for associated incentive payments.  The aim of this proposal is to assist provider groups in the TIP network to maximize incentive payments through core components and milestones completion. It is anticipated that the LC will help managed care organizations (MCOs) better align with their provider networks to drive performance improvement, develop strategies to promote care integration, and continue to implement initiatives towards value-based health care systems where members' experience and population health are improved while per-capita healthcare costs are contained. Improved alignment between MCOs and providers and their successful engagement in value based payment models is a mechanism by which TIP can create sustainable impact in Arizona. The seven AHCCCS Complete Care (ACC) health plans will cooperate with the LC in an effort to strengthen provider networks for successful value-based payment models in the future.  The TIP providers participating in the LC will maximize the incentive payments by receiving   timely,  actionable information and a performance management system featuring a forum to share best practices and disseminate the practical content needed to achieve the TIP core components and milestones.  The TIP Learning Collaborative is an investment in provider groups to achieve the performance milestones as well as a broader impact by building a foundation for high performing, coordinated integrated networks rather than disparate siloed providers. Currently there are limited opportunities for provider practices to collaboratively engage in learning opportunities related to quality improvement. The TIP Learning Collaborative provides a structure for providers to learn how to become more robust partners in value-based contracts with MCOs. MCOs can then leverage what is learned from the TIP participants to their broader network to drive successful provider performance under value-based payment models. We will focus on recruiting small and rural providers, who can be left behind in opportunities to participate in innovative projects and payment models, thereby broadening the opportunities MCOs have to engage those providers in performance improvement. We describe next the project organization, work plan, budget and research team.      2 Led by an expert team from Arizona State University (ASU), this project consists of four main activities: 1) Project Oversight; 2) Learning Collaborative Development and Implementation; 3) Learning Collaborative Operations; and 4) Data Collection, Analysis, and Reporting.  Project Organization 1.  Project Oversight This project will be guided by a Steering Committee consisting of representative members of the Arizona health plans such as medical directors and leadership from AHCCCS. We will also invite the Arizona Medical Association (ArMA), the Arizona Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Arizona Council of Human Service Providers. The Steering Committee will meet monthly.  The purpose of the LC is to eliminate duplication of efforts and reduce administrative burden for health plans and providers. The LC can facilitate coordinated population health management strategies, reduce variations in care processes, promote best practices, and thereby reduce care fragmentation, and enhance care coordination.  2.  Learning Collaborative Development and Implementation  We will recruit groups from the TIP participants to participate in a LC. Each LC will consist of 25 to 35 groups. The total number of collaboratives will range from 1 to 8. The collaboratives will be organized on a regional basis for provider convenience. Each collaborative will begin with a half day in-person kick-off meeting, followed by monthly 2-hour virtual meetings supplemented by individual consulting and assistance as needed. Each participating group will include a provider champion and administrative lead.  We will begin by conducting a needs assessment and establish baseline performance to prioritize the core competencies and barriers to milestone achievement. Each monthly LC session involves peer learning, status updates on individual group performance in achieving the milestones and learning from best practices. 3.  Learning Collaborative Operations Each monthly learning collaborative will include:    Each provider group will receive the consolidated milestone review as well as its own performance report (individual group performance metrics will be confidential). The monthly performance reports will include the metrics for all TIP milestones.    A consolidated performance report review will include clinical and process experts, as well as peer discussion. Issues will be prioritized in advance by the clinical and process experts.    Report out from previous month follow-up.    Prior to each meeting, a root cause analysis will be conducted to better understand the process problems that appear that month. This step is very important in order to avoid surface level solutions that will not be lasting.   3   Quality Improvement (QI) methods and techniques (root cause analysis, process maps, cause and effect diagram, statistical process control) and related analytical methods will be used by the project team in the evaluation of monthly performance. In conjunction with the clinical and process experts, a plan-do-study-act (PDSA) format will be used for follow-up.    Methods to identify and mitigate barriers. Learning collaborative participants will be differentiated according to the best performers, lagging performers, and intermediate performers. Specific strategies will be developed and customized for the best performers and lagging performers (this terminology is not associated with AHCCCS methodology for determining incentive payments).    Peer learning will be used by inviting a best performer group to demonstrate how it is achieving the milestone target. This allows lagging and intermediate performing groups to ask questions and seek answers.    Specific action steps to improve performance will be discussed at each meeting. Follow-up will be done with intermediate performers and lagging performers to assist and facilitate action step follow up.     As needed, presentations will be provided by national experts regarding methods to overcome specific problems, motivate participants, and achieve milestones.    We will engage Equality Health as clinical and process partners.   4.  Data Collection, Analysis, and Reporting We will provide accurate and timely performance feedback to providers using expedited transfer of claims data provided by AHCCCS for analysis by the ASU team The data analysis, and reporting will leverage the ASU Center for Health Information & Research (CHiR) which has been handling identified clinical data for approximately 20 years in their Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant, audited facility. This includes AHCCCS claims data, as well as claims data and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from other large provider organizations in the state, and the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) Hospital Discharge data. CHiR has established operating processes to receive claims data, EHR data, and others from multiple sources in the state. Processes are also in place to clean the data and, when necessary, transform to a nationally-used common data model to provide a consistent framework from various data sources. Staff members have substantial experience with report generation as well as state of the art software for customized analysis.  The leadership and technical team will work with stakeholders to design relevant reports for each participating group (confidential) as well as consolidated milestone measures for benchmarking. Individualized monthly reports will provide feedback (timely, consistent, and actionable) on performance on all milestones (longitudinal trends, performance to peers). These reports will be supplemented with a web-based dashboard (dashboard) to enable participants to review performance measures in a consistent, organized manner, to review historical trends, and so forth. The Steering Committee will receive authorized access to the dashboard with MCO data de-identified. The reports and dashboard will not include personal health information. The  4 reports and dashboard will use substantial visualizations for more impactful summaries of performance.  The dashboard will be the center of a web-based Community Forum (CF) that will encourage discussion, comments, share resources, and help among participants. Participants can share performance results with other members of their organization through authorized access to the dashboard. A dashboard of the milestone performance and metrics for each area of concentration will be reported monthly (for example there are 20 core components and 31 milestones for pediatric primary care providers).  Workplan  The workplan in Table 1 consists of seven key components and identifies the activities which will be undertaken for this project. The activities are differentiated according to start-up and ongoing tasks.

FP00019403_Res1,81,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  Colorectal cancer imposes a significant economic and humanistic burden on patients and society. The barriers to cure cancer include tumor immune tolerance and metastatic tumors. Oncolytic bacteria-based therapy has been extensively studied in recent years to fill cancer patients' critical unmet needs, where the current treatment options  have  been  exhausted.  Our  genetically  modified Salmonella (GMS)  unique  features  enable  them  to search for cancer cells and tumors, deliver anti-cancer materials inside of tumors, and then eradicate themselves from the host after serving the purpose of treatment. In this study, we propose to tumor-specifically deliver decoy binding partners to target multiple cancer cell-surface receptors. These efforts will restore the anti-tumor immune response and suppress cancer stem cells (CSC) formation and expansion, inhibit the activation of tumor growth signaling pathway, and provoke cancer cell apoptosis within the tumor microenvironment. In addition, we will also create and evaluate sweets-obsessive GMS strains to deprive glucose of tumor microenvironment (TME) and metabolically reprogram tumor-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. The success of our efforts would turn microbes to appropriate onsite attackers of the cancer cells, activators of the immune system, and inhibitors of the CSCs for effective cancer therapy to be successful and applicable across a wide range of tumor types.

The terms and conditions specific to this IRP are as follows:  Examples: 1. Funding total $ 130,000 2. Period of Performance is from 04/01/2020 through 03/31/2021  FOOD SYSTEMS SUSTAINABILITY: Food Waste Reduction, Food Waste Models Development, and Dietary Shifts Project Lead: Christopher Wharton Team: Maricarmen Vizcaino, Kathleen Merrigan, Suzanne Palmieri  MOTIVATION To develop, sustain and propagate more resilient food systems, we need a stronger, more impactful approach to diet-related behavior changes that have the potential to improve health and minimize environmental impact, simultaneously. The approach this research team has established in collaboration with the Kaiteki Institute and the Global Kaiteki Center is to a) develop theoretically based behavior change interventions to reduce food waste, and b) to utilize lessons learned from this work and other research to advance a second vital line of food waste research: building strong, predictive models of food waste behavior. The goal remains to design, apply, and scale novel behavior change mechanisms, with eventual development of assistive services and products, to promote food waste reduction among consumers and in households.   Further, this research team is adding a second line of related research for this funding year. This area is focused specifically on dietary shifts, exploring and advancing dietary patterns that reduce demand on limited resources with a particular interest in protein sources, both plant and animal. This work is vital to identify dietary patterns that are healthful and sustainable simultaneously, and to identify mechanisms for adoption and persistence in dietary shifts among consumers.   SCOPE OF PROPOSED PROJECT The overall projects scope is 3 years in total, and this proposed project will run from April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021. The first year (April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2020) of the project was focused on foundational food waste studies in intervention design and modeling related to food waste. The following two years will include more advanced work, including building stronger models using structural equation modeling and machine learning to identify the best predictive design, then applying that to the national and international scales. Further, we plan to expand application of the values-based behavior change approach to other key areas for Kaiteki, including plant-based diets and the future of protein. These studies will be designed to improve sustainability, health, and overall well-being among individuals, families, and communities in terms of adoption and persistence in dietary shift behaviors. Finally, innovations coming out of wasted food research will have the opportunity for scaling and business development in Year 3.  WHY IS THE PROPOSED PROJECT IMPORTANT FOR TKI AND THE WORLD An underlying principle guiding this framework of activities is that in employing a values-based approach demonstrates the synergistic benefits of both food waste reduction and dietary shifts for financial, environmental, and physical societal health. The notion of KAITEKI refers to the sustainable well-being of people, society, and planet Earth through adding management of sustainability to traditional management of economics and technology. This, along with TKIs goals in promoting consumer and client behavior change, aligns seamlessly with the current and new projects we propose. Further, our approach to food systems solutions is meant to have impact across the food system, from production of consumer products to household decision-making among consumers themselves. Finally, our proposed projects are positioned for scalability. ASU, the Swette Center, and partnering researchers have collaborations that span the region, the country, and the globe. Results of our work can be applied as quickly in other cities as they can other countries. Because of our values-based approach to each of these projects, we believe we are building systems that provide any stakeholder multiple avenues to engage and identify the importance of considering food system sustainability as part of their decision-making.  UNIQUENESS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT AND ITS ANTICIPATED RESULTS Almost no research exists employing behavioral interventions in food waste. Further, no research exists exploring food waste behaviors from a modeling perspective at the national and international levels.  This research team is therefore positioned to have impact domestically and globally. After our first year of work, the research team is now poised to better understand the problem of consumer food waste at the global level and begin deploying lessons learned in new interventions elsewhere, such as in other municipalities aside from Phoenix.  As such, we anticipate the following results from the proposed activities: 1) further advancements behavior change methodologies; 2) a newly developed and robust model of food waste at the national scale; 3) application of models for international comparisons of food waste behaviors; 4) opportunities to explore product innovation that supports food waste reduction at the household level; and 5) new research focused on dietary shifts, specifically related to how people can adopt changes in proportion of protein consumption from animal to plant-based foods, and in persistent ways.  DESCRPTION OF 2nd-YEARs WORK AND DELIVERABLES Q1: Conduct national-level food waste model study. Q2: Explore international study opportunities, and develop new scale for social support for plant-forward diets. Further, explore possible dietary shifts feeding trials Q3: Conduct international comparative studies of food waste behaviors. Launch dietary shifts feeding trial. Q4: Prepare publications on food waste and dietary shifts studies and identify routes for scaling impact.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND DELIVERABLES FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS Year 3 will focus on more employing and scaling food waste innovations, including developing materials or products and testing utility among consumers and households. Further, Year 3 will launch new dietary shifts studies and explore means to scale dietary shifts among larger groups of people in relation to developing a movement focused on health and sustainability via diet and food waste reduction.  BUDGET FOR 2nd, and 3rd YEARS Budget, 2nd Year: $130,000. Budget, Project Year 3: To be determined.  All other provisions set forth in the aforementioned Agreement shall remain the same.

FP00019561_Rev2,84,,,,,1,,," Individual Research Project (IRP) No. FP00019561 EXHIBIT C to Master Agreement  under Master Agreement Between And The KAITEKI Institute The Arizona Board of Regents for and on behalf of Arizona State University  Per the Master Agreement effective 03/19/2019, this IRP, as specified in IRP Scope of Work attached hereto, is hereby authorized.  The terms and conditions specific to this IRP are as follows:  Examples: 1. Funding total $ 130,000 2. Period of Performance is from 04/01/2021 through 03/31/2022  FOOD SYSTEMS SUSTAINABILITY: Food Waste Reduction, Food Waste Models Development, and Dietary Shifts Project Lead: Christopher Wharton Team: Maricarmen Vizcaino, Kelly Cosgrove, Eva Alpine, Bryanna Leone  MOTIVATION To develop, sustain and propagate more resilient food systems, we need a stronger, more impactful approach to diet-related behavior changes that have the potential to improve health and minimize environmental impact, simultaneously. The approach this research team has established in collaboration with the Kaiteki Institute and the Global Kaiteki Center is to a) develop theoretically based behavior change interventions to reduce food waste and support shifts towards more plant-based diets, and b) to build this work towards a more comprehensive notion of food-related behavior change incorporating efficient management of food in the home and healthier and more sustainable dietary intake simultaneously. This work is designed to lead to novel behavior change mechanisms, with eventual development of assistive services and products, to promote food waste reduction and healthier diets among consumers and in households.   SCOPE OF PROPOSED PROJECT The overall projects scope is 3 years in total, and this proposed project will run from April 1, 2021 - March 31, 2022. The first year (April 1, 2019 - March 31, 2020) of the project was focused on foundational food waste studies in intervention design and modeling related to food waste. The following year focused on expansion of research on food waste to the international level, developing models for 4 different countries with differing ethical expectations related to food behaviors. It also included development of new scientific tools for evaluating food waste and plant-based diet behaviors, as well as new research on the impact of COVID-19 on food and health behaviors.   Year 3 will include projects that pull previous research together, incorporating both food waste and plant-based diets into a new series of conferences, intervention studies, and other modeling work focused on the KAITEKI Dietary Approach, which takes a holistic view of diet from health and sustainability perspectives.  Interventions will be piloted and a new international conference will be launched to further explore this concept. Finally, other work will continue to include improved modeling for food waste, COVID-19 research related to health, and validation of new tools for assessing behavior in more comprehensive ways. All this work is designed to improve sustainability, health, and overall well-being among individuals, families, and communities in terms of adoption and persistence in dietary shift behaviors. Finally, innovations coming out of wasted food research will have the opportunity for scaling and business development in Year 3.  WHY IS THE PROPOSED PROJECT IMPORTANT FOR TKI AND THE WORLD An underlying principle guiding this framework of activities is that in employing a values-based approach demonstrates the synergistic benefits of both food waste reduction and dietary shifts for financial, environmental, and physical societal health. The notion of KAITEKI refers to the sustainable well-being of people, society, and planet Earth through adding management of sustainability to traditional management of economics and technology. This, along with TKIs goals in promoting consumer and client behavior change, aligns seamlessly with the current and new projects we propose. Further, our approach to food systems solutions is meant to have impact across the food system, from production of consumer products to household decision-making among consumers themselves. Finally, our proposed projects are positioned for scalability. ASU, the Swette Center, and partnering researchers have collaborations that span the region, the country, and the globe. Results of our work can be applied as quickly in other cities as they can other countries. Because of our values-based approach to each of these projects, we believe we are building systems that provide any stakeholder multiple avenues to engage and identify the importance of considering food system sustainability as part of their decision-making.  UNIQUENESS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT AND ITS ANTICIPATED RESULTS Very little research exists employing behavioral interventions in food waste. Further, no research exists exploring a more holistic approach to food, sustainability, and health that incorporates food waste and plant-based dietary behaviors at the individual and household levels. This research team is therefore positioned to have impact domestically and globally on a more comprehensive scale. After our first two years of work, the research team is now poised to better understand the problem of, and potential solutions to, poor utilization of food.  As such, we anticipate the following results from the proposed activities: 1) further advancements in behavior change methodologies as well as white papers developed out of conferences to this effect; 2) a newly developed and robust series of models and tools related to both food waste and plant-based diets; 3) newly piloted interventions weaving together prior results into a KAITEKI Dietary Approach; and 4) opportunities to explore product innovation that supports healthy and efficient food use at the individual and household levels.  DESCRPTION OF 3rd-YEARs WORK AND DELIVERABLES Q1: Iterate on international-level food waste modeling study, and develop plans for the first international conference on the KAITEKI Dietary Approach. This quarter will include a specific focus on improving the Japanese model for predicting food waste-related behaviors in close consultation with our Kaiteki counterparts. Work may include developing new tools to measure culturally specific concepts, such as the notion of mottainai. Q2: Plan and conduct a pilot dietary intervention incorporating both food waste and plant-based dietary shifts behavior changes, with a focus on improved health and sustainability behavioral outcomes. This project would be a test-run of a comprehensive behavioral intervention designed to address food more holistically in individuals lives. It therefore would constitute a multiple behavior change study designed to elicit synergistic improvements in both food waste reduction, and healthy and sustainable dietary intake.  Q3: Use pilot results to develop and conduct a larger-scale study of greater sophistication. Assuming positive results from the pilot study, this study would utilize successful techniques in behavior change methodologies as well as modify and iterate on components that show need for improvement. Further, greather sophistication in analytic approaches would be included, possibly incorporating blood samples and anthropometric data for evaluation of changes in risk factors for chronic diseases. Q4: Hold conference, prepare publications on food waste models and newly developed tools, and analyze and report on data related to intervention studies.  Overall, year 3 will also include exploration of ways to scale dietary shifts and food waste reductions among larger groups of people in relation to developing a movement focused on health and sustainability via diet and food waste reduction. This will include exploration of scalable products and services.    BUDGET FOR 3rd YEAR Budget, 3rd Year: $130,000.

FP00019634_Rev1,85,,,,,1,,,"Equipment Supplement Project Number:     1R01GM135927-01       Geometry Title:     Dense Life-log Health Analytics from Wearable Sensors using Functional Analysis and Riemannian  1. Summary of Parent Award                                            The growth and acceptance of wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) and personal technologies (e.g., smartphones), coupled with larger storage capacities, waterproofing, and more unobtrusive wear locations, has made long-term monitoring of behaviors throughout the 24-hour spectrum more feasible. Wearable devices  relevantfor human activity (e.g., GENEActiv accelerometer) contain several complementary sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, heart-beat rate etc.) and sample at high rates (e.g., 100Hz for accelerometer). This project addresses the unique mathematical and computational challenges posed by densely multimodal, long-term, densely-sampled lifelog big-data in a comprehensive framework. The proposed approach also  brings to fore: a) new mathematical developments of elastic metrics over multimodal time-series data, b)comparing sequences evolving on different feature manifolds, c) estimation of quasi-periodicities, d) and a new generation of machine-learning and pattern discovery algorithms. The mathematical and algorithmic tools  proposed have the potential to significantly advance how wearable data from contemporary devices with high-sampling rates and large storage capabilities are represented, processed, and transformed into accurateinferences about human activity. The long-term goal of the research is to enable personalized home-based physical activity regimens for conditions such as stroke and diabetes.                                                                                                                       2. New Equipment Requested   As part of feature-learning on large-scale datasets available to us. A quote for the requested equipment is attached.  funds for a GPU rack server. This is to enable time-series this supplement, we request              3. Scientific justification for the requested equipment          Our project initially began with exploring mathematical models for time-series alignment, and its impact on results indicated the time-series pre-alignment withdownstream feature extraction methods. Our prior  functional analysis methods helps improve performance of standard machine-learning techniques like support  vector-machines, in conjunction with standard time-series features like energy features, fourier features, etc. As our project progressed, we found that it is important to consider the role of new emerging feature-learning approaches to extract downstream time-series features. Our results demonstrate:                                                        Features learned via deep learning architectures perform better than hand-engineered features.  Learned-features from other datasets can be fine-tuned for smaller datasets and perform better.     These findings are described in more detail in Section 5. Both these findings have significant implications on how signals from wearables devices should be processed for downstream activity analysis applications. To fully develop our approach and conduct additional experiments, we need significant GPU computational resources that will be dedicated to this project.                                       4. Benefit to related NIH projects   The resources will also benefit related NIH projects that our co-PI Matthew Buman has led and collected similar wearable data to evaluate the efficacy of community and clinical interventions. These projects have been listed below with a brief description of the use cases that will be supported by a GPU server above.

This project will collect high-density smartphone application usage, wifi smart plug, and Fitbit data to provide the first-of-its-kind objective assessment of sedentary screen time. Further, an activPAL data fit to the thigh will be used to measure posture over weeks of data collection. A GPU server will serve to fuse these data using similar algorithms as described above to process these data.  Smartphone-Based Diabetes Prevention in the VA: A Cluster-Randomized Trial.   R18DK109516: 9/1/2016-8/31/2020 [MPI: Buman & Reaven]. This project tested the pragmatic delivery of a  smartphone-delivered intervention to prevent diabetes in VA primary care clinics in the Phoenix VA Healthcare System. A GENEactiv accelerometer, as noted above, has been used in this study on three weekly occasions  over a 9-month period to evaluate sleep, sedentary time, and physical activity behaviors during an intervention in Veterans with prediabetes to prevent the onset of diabetes.  R01CA198971: Stand & Move at Work: A Group Randomized Trial. 07/02/15  06/30/20 [MPI: Buman &  Pereira]. The goals of this project were to test the efficacy of two interventions to reduce sitting, increase light-intensity physical activity, and improve cardiometabolic health in worksites. We have collected more than  2,000 weekly assessments of home- and work-based sedentary time in 630 sedentary office workers, andmore advanced algorithms are needed to provide more fine-tuned insights into how the interventions impacted worker health.                                                                                                                                5. Details of preliminary experiments on feature-learning                                                                                                      We used the GENEactiv accelerometer dataset in our experiments. The data was collected at a sampling rateof 100Hz using the GENEactiv sensor, a light-weight, waterproof, wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer. The dataset consists of 29 different human-activity classes from 152 subjects. The 29 activity classes consists of: 4   non-ambulatory activity classes; 8 treadmill activity classes performed at different speeds; 3 free-living running activity classes; 14 free-living walking types on different surfaces, without or while carrying an object. For our  experiments we split the above activity classes into two disjoint sets. The first set consists of the 8 treadmillactivity classes and the second set contains the remaining 21 activities. We show classification results on the second set. We compare the classification performance of hand-engineered features to two deep learning methods where the features are learnt directly from the data. The first deep learning method consists of  learning features from scratch which we will refer to as Learnt Features-Supervised Learning. The secondmethod consists of using a pre-trained classification model to initialize the weights of the target classification model and fine-tune it for the target classification task. We refer to this method as Learnt Features - Transfer Learning. This approach helps quickly develop classification models as it avoids the need to train the weights  of the model from scratch. We train the pre-trained model on the set containing the 8 treadmill activity classes, and use its weights to initialize the weights of the target classification model. In the below table, we show F-1 scores of activity recognition performance for different features, as the training-set size varies. The first row  shows the performance of hand-engineered features as the training-set size changes. The test set contains 11499 samples. The second row shows the performance of features that are learnt from scratch using deeplearning architectures. The third row shows features that are learnt using deep learning architectures from the  set containing treadmill activities, and fine-tuned for the target activity set.                                                                                                                                                                                                           We find that learned features perform better than hand-engineered features in both cases. Further, using features learnt on the treadmill-activity set but fine-tuned on target activity set performs the best. These results underscore the importance of investigating in-depth the role of feature-learning approaches in our project.                            ",
FP00019656_Rev1,86,,,,,1,,,"1. Request for REU supplement Justification for REU Supplement We  do  not  currently  have  any  undergraduate  students  working  on  our  NSF  CSSI  funded project  at  Arizona  State  University.  We  wish  to  obtain  additional  funding  through  an  REU supplement  for  one  student  to  perform  work  that  was  not  anticipated  when  the  proposal  was written,  as  explained  below.  The  REU  supplement  will  also  provide  additional  mentoring opportunities to the student. Since we received this award, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak began and is currently circulating around the globe. Our models are ideally suited to model transmission of this virus in crowded areas, such as airports, and also its global spread by linking pedestrian dynamics with phylogeography.  Work  on  this  issue  promises  substantial  broader  impact,  along  with  the intellectual merit in the modeling aspect.  We describe the REU funded research plan for the students in Section 1.1. We then describe, in  Section  1.2,  the  experience  of  the  PI  and  Co-PI  in  mentoring  undergraduate  students  in research.  Section  1.3  describes  our  specific  plans  for  mentoring  students  on  this  REU  and Section 1.4 explains the student selection method. 1.1 Nature of student involvement in the research project Analysis  of  coronavirus:  As  of  February  28,  2020,  there  are  more  than  83,000  confirmed cases of coronavirus with most of these in China. However, the virus has already been detected in every other continent and will soon be a global pandemic. The virus, which is found in the upper respiratory tract and spread by coughing and sneezing, has the potential to cause massive outbreaks  outside  of  China  including  the  United  States.  The  virus  has  also  caused  outbreaks during  travel  on  the  cruise  ship  Diamond  Princess,  with  over  600  infected  people.  Not surprisingly, much attention has been brought to air travel during this outbreak. In the United States, eleven airports have implemented heightened screening by using special thermometers to check for elevated temperatures. More than 30,000 travelers have been screened but none have led to the identification of new cases of COVID-19. In addition, more than 200,000 flights to China  have  been  canceled  due  to  the  outbreak  including  by  US  carriers  such  as  United, American, and Delta. Like the cruise ship quarantine, these flight cancelations have also caused policy debates about the correct course of action to curb the outbreak. Our pedestrian dynamics results  can  provide  scientific  insight  into  procedural  changes,  such  as  in  queue  formation,  to reduce  likelihood  of  infection  transmission  without  restricting  air  travel.  In  addition,  we  had proposed  a  methodology  in  CSSI  proposal  to  study  the  global  impact  of  local  policies  by integrating  phylogeography  and  pedestrian  dynamics.  We  will  study  such  impact  using  the coronavirus outbreak as an example. The intellectual merit of this project includes new analysis of coronavirus COVID-19 by integrating pedestrian dynamics and phylogeography. This work is novel and has yet to be done in the scientific literature. The coronavirus analysis work will involve pedestrian dynamics analysis at the local scale by collaborators at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and at medium scale at the University of West Florida. The former will study the local impact of policies, such as at an airport, while the latter  will  examine  the  potential  medium  scale  spread  of  coronavirus  from  airports  to  nearby cities. At Arizona State University, we will leverage the virus sequences (currently 93) that have been  generated  from  this  outbreak  and  develop  phylogeographic-generalized  linear  models (GLM) to examine the impact of predictors on global transmission. Many of the predictors will be based off of the policy choices in the local and medium scale models. The undergraduate student at Arizona State University will design and implement the global scale phylogeography-GLM models using rigor to identify the best model for the data. They will work  with  the  students  and  senior  collaborators  from  University  of  West  Florida  and  Embry-Riddle  Aeronautical  University  to  integrate  the  predictors  from  the  local  and  medium  scale models. They will also be tasked with identifying demographic and climate-related variables. The tasks to be performed require proficiency in Bayesian phylogeography including the use of  the  software  BEAST  1.10.4  and  BEAUti  1.10.4.  These  are  JAVA-based  software  and  thus knowledge of JAVA is also required. The student will then need to interpret results and test for model performance. The student will also be required to use R for additional analysis and visual graphics of the linear models. GIS-related software will also be needed for visualizing spread. The student involved will have courses providing skills in programming, software engineering, and phylogenetics.  1.2 Experience of the PI and Co-PI in involving students in undergraduate research PI Scotch has extensive experience in mentoring undergraduate students. He has advised six ASU  Barrett  Honors  College  students  on  their  senior  thesis,  one  non-Barrett  student  on  her senior  thesis,  and  another  on  her  undergraduate  research  project.  Co-PI  Mubayi  also  has extensive experience mentoring undergraduate students in mathematical biology many, who are underrepresented minorities and females. They include 67% minorities and over 50% women. In total, he has directly advised the research or training of 36 undergraduates (including 12 thesis).  As a broader impact, the student will gain experience in writing scientific manuscripts and the PI will encourage him/her to pursue graduate research.  1.3 Student mentoring The PI will hold individual meetings with the student on a weekly basis and mentor him/her on his/her research and on career options, such as graduate studies. The student will also be able to be mentored by the Co-PI, and more senior peers in the lab including graduate students and postdocs. The PI also intends to support the undergraduate student to enable him/her to attend conferences. 1.4 Student selection method The student will be identified from the Biomedical Informatics undergraduate Bachelor of Science  (BS)  program  at  ASU.  Many  of  the  BMI  BS  students  are  also  in  ASUs  Barrett,  the Honors College. We currently have 78 students in the program including 44 (56%) female.   ",
FP00019759,87,,,,,1,,,"Scope of Work for ASU Delphi Panel Project One underdeveloped area of team-based skills for physicians is integrated behavioral health (IBH). Although there is recent development in competencies for medical students and residents preparing to work in IBH teams, the appropriateness of these competencies for providers from multiple medical disciplines (e.g., internal medicine, pediatrics, nurse practitioner) is not clear. The purpose of this project is three-fold: first, determine the fit of medical resident competencies with multiple medical disciplines; second, test a new measure of physician confidence in integrated care; three, to expand our curriculum with training videos for medical providers. The success of this project will allow us to adapt our training program for medical providers in practice and develop personalized learning pathways that physicians can use to determine what training best fits their needs.

FP00019800,88,,,,,1,,,"My primary goal as a clinical researcher is to find solutions and identify the source of the problem statement I can hear speech, but I cant understand it.. This statement is heard daily in audiology clinics and is not fully remedied by current diagnostic and treatment tools. My experience as a clinician and the knowledge I have obtained from counseling with patients provides me with unique perspectives and motivation needed to attack this problem. Current clinical practice focuses mainly on the measure and restoration of audibility but, hearing impairment (HI) is more than just reduced audibility. HI can lead to altered central auditory processing, re- weighting of non-auditory sensory inputs, and perceptual handicaps (Roseman & Thiel, 2018). One significant perceptual handicap is a reduction in spatial awareness. Spatial awareness is a multisensory percept involving the integration of auditory, visual, vestibular and proprioceptive sensory information of environmental events; that helps extract meaningful information and filter out unwanted sound in noisy or reverberant environments. However, reduction in spatial awareness of HI listeners is often overlooked in clinical evaluations. Translational approaches to apply this understanding in clinical settings will be essential in improving current treatment of spatial deficits caused by hearing impairment.This training plan offers me an opportunity to bridge clinical and research worlds through rigorous research design and analysis with a focus on one neglected behavioral product that helps extract meaningful information and filter out unwanted sound in noisy or reverberant environmentsreaction time. Through this proposal I aim to understand the crossmodal effects of vision on sound source localization. This knowledge is important in clinical evaluations of everyday experience of HI listeners and can help expand currently auditory-centered diagnostic procedures seen in many clinics to solving real-life challenges (e.g., use sound and light cues crossing a busy street). My research laboratory, led by Dr. Yi Zhou, has established a comprehensive testing environment to address this question in both humans and marmoset monkeys (Montagne & Zhou, 2016; Montagne & Zhou, 2018). I will integrate and improve our setup to study two response metrics (response accuracy and reaction time) in a multisensory spatial localization task in normal and HI listeners. These two metrics are related to the accuracy of spatial judgements and the time that it takes to make a judgement, respectively. They are two sides of the same coin (i.e., spatial analysis). Response accuracy (RA), the most commonly used metric, characterizes the final result of spatial processing (Blauert, 1997), whereas reaction time (RT) characterizes the cumulative processing time from sensory processing to cognitive decision making, to behavioral responses (e.g., push a button). Careful manipulation of experimental procedure can help distinguish what aspect of these processes affects a particular RT measure (Luce, 2008), potentially providing information on either sensory or cognitive stages of processing deficits after hearing impairment. To study natural behavioral responses, I will measure eye saccades in localizing an auditory target, as saccades represent a natural orienting response to the sudden onset of a sound from an unexpected location.Aim 1: To identify the effects of stimulus spatial saliency on response accuracy and saccade reaction time in auditory localization tasks.The experiments are designed to measure RA and RT of eye saccades in localizing a noise burst with different levels of saliency, evaluate the changes in eye saccade RT when the sound is accompanied by a visual LED light, and compare the effects of visual stimulation on eye saccade RT between normal hearing (NH) and hearing impaired (HI) listeners. I will test the hypothesis that more salient auditory cues will be associated with increased RA and less change in RT. In contrast, I expect that less salient auditory cues will be associated with a decrease in RA and a significant change in RT. Additionally, I hypothesize that visual bias will be significantly correlated with auditory cue salience, affecting both RA and RT. I also hypothesize that the pattern of effect seen in NH listeners as stimulus salience decreases will be magnified in HI listeners due to degraded spatial processing that accompanies hearing impairment.Aim 2: To measure saccade reaction time in localizing a sound source coming from either frontal or rear space and investigate the effects of frontal visual stimulation on auditory reaction time.The experiments are designed to measure RT of eye saccades in localizing a noise burst presented from the front or the rear and compare the effects of visual stimulation on RTs between NH and HI listeners. I will test the hypothesis that vision influences auditory decision making even when sound sources originate outside the field of vision, and this influence is manifested by changes in RT. Furthermore, I hypothesize that the manner in which vision distracts or captures auditory decision-making will be dependent on the spatial domain of visual influence, with a lateral visual domain resulting in increased visual distraction and a frontal domain resulting in increased visual capture. I will test whether these possible patterns are also correlated with the configurations of HI (bilateral or unilateral) inducing a shift in frontal and lateral visual spatial attention.",
FP00019800_Res1,89,,,,,1,,,"Spatial awareness (i.e. the sense of the space that we are in) involves the integration of auditory, visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory information of environmental events. Hearing impairment has negative effects on spatial awareness and can result in deficits in communication (especially in noisy or reverberant environments) and the overall aesthetic experience of life. However, current clinical evaluation and treatmenthave not been able to address the issue of spatial awareness due to the paucity of research data. The long term goal of this research is to characterize the changes in spatial awareness that accompany hearing impairment and interfere with the listener's ability to interact with their environment. This proposal will examine two behavioral outcomesresponse accuracy and response timebased on eye movement in response to simultaneously presented auditory and visual stimuli for normal hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Experiments are designed to identify the effects of stimulus spatial saliency on response accuracy and response time and the extent of visual dominance in both metrics in auditory localization (Aim 1) and the effectof frontal visual stimulation on localizing an auditory target presented from in front of or behind a listener (Aim 2). We test the hypothesis that hearing impairment results in increased visual bias, evidenced by changes in both response accuracy and response time in auditory localization. The results from this study will improve understanding of spatial decision-making deficits that result from hearing impairment and shed light on how hearing impairment induces changes in visual spatial functions. A better understanding of these effects will allow future inclusion of response time into clinical testing for better evaluation of the impacts of hearing impairment on everyday lives. Translation approaches to implement this understanding into clinical settings willbe critical in addressing the spatial deficits experienced by hearing impaired listeners in real-world environments. The rigorous research design summarized above will be paired with a training plan focused on training in research, education in statistics, probability and modeling, and the development of a scholarly infrastructure. Afocus will be placed on training in acoustic measurements, eye-tracking systems, programming of sound and light stimulus delivery, and time-series data analysis. The overall goal of the training plan for Dr. Clayton is to develop the skills necessary to become an engaged, productive scientist capable of integrating clinical andtranslational research. The training areas identified are designed to supplement Dr. Claytons previous clinical training and research experience. This training will be completed in a rich, collaborative environment within a laboratory that has documented experience examining multisensory interactions in environments more typicalof real-life situations. The outcome of this training plan and research proposal will prepare Dr. Clayton to advance the state of hearing healthcare services as a clinician-scientist.",

Testing has  low  sensitivity  and  specificity  leaving  sick  patients  and  their  health  care  providers  without  an  accurate diagnosis.  Thus, there is a profound need for better diagnostic approaches to properly identify Cocci patients to ensure appropriate follow-up and therapy ensues.   Coccidioides spp. grow as mycelia in the desert soils and produce spores (arthroconidia) to survive during times of adverse growth conditions.  When this soil is disturbed, arthroconidia aerosolize and are inhaled to initiate infection.  Inside the host, the spores transform into spherules containing endospores which grow in the lung.  When spherules burst, endospores, are released and can each disseminate to form a new spherule.     Clinical diagnosis is difficult because patients symptoms resemble other bacterial and viral pneumonias.  Laboratory diagnosis often relies solely on serology, but ~50% of patients do not test positive while they are acutely ill which results in inaccurate diagnosis an inappropriate treatment.  We propose that it is time for a re-evaluation  of  seroreactive  coccidioidal  antigens.  For  the  past  six  decades,  serologic  diagnosis  of coccidioidomycosis  has  relied  on  IgM  responses  to  tube  precipitin  (TP)  and  IgG  responses  to  complement fixation (CF) antigens.  Since these antigens are primarily expressed in mycelia, not in spherules which is the fungal form that grows in the host, it is not surprising that many patients are seronegative because they have not yet generated antibodies during acute pulmonary illness.    The GOAL of this proposal is to identify new coccidioidal antigens that react with acutely infected patient sera.  The objectives are to utilize the recently published Coccidioides spp. proteome to create a nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) in which every coccidioidal protein is screened for reactivity with VF patient sera.  Our hypothesis is that this survey of the Coccidioides proteome will reveal new antigens that are reactive with more patients, especially acutely ill patients who are seronegative for TP and/or CF antigens.  Once we identify a small panel of seroreactive antigens, they can be incorporated into a reliable, consistent, accurate test that will increase the number of positive diagnoses in acutely ill patients with early disease.

FP00020124_Res1,92,,,,,1,,,"International and national assessments show that the reading achievement of a significant proportion of US adolescents is poor (NAEP, 2017) and below that of same-age readers in other English-speaking countries (PISA, 2015). There has been no substantive improvement in recent years. This is problematic, because the reading demands for the current generation of adolescents require them to navigate increasingly complex texts and assimilate information with their extant background knowledge to develop essential topic knowledge of the curriculum. Current models of reading comprehension do not specify the influence of the broader language and cognitive skills that adolescent readers bring to the task, and how this might differ from their influence on reading comprehension in the early grades when children are still learning to read. Reader characteristics such as background knowledge, knowledge of reading strategies, motivation and working memory/executive function develop across adolescence and, as such, might play an increasing influential role. Additionally, our theoretical models of reading comprehension are built on a narrow view of reading comprehension, that does not typically reflect what we read (text type: expository vs narrative) or how (medium: print vs digital). This work will build on research conducted by the Language and Reading Research Consortium (LARRC) and the Monolingual and Bilingual Reading Comprehension group. We will continue our longitudinal study of students who entered preschool speaking English and those who entered preschool as Spanish-English dual language learners; these students will be assessed in Grades 10 and 12. Additionally, we will recruit new groups of Grade 10 monolingual English students and Spanish-English dual-language learners for cross-sectional studies. We will address the following aims: (1) To determine the theoretical structure of a comprehensive model of reading comprehension in adolescence to include the structure of the cognitive, psychological, and ecological predictors of reading comprehension and the structure of reading comprehension itself; (2) To examine the structure and relationship between cognitive, psychological and ecological factors and reading comprehension over time to identify risk and protective factors for poor and good reading comprehension across Grades 6, 8, 10, and 12; and (3) To determine the extent to which cognitive, psychological, ecological, and reading comprehension scores in Grades 10 and 12 are associated with the post-secondary goals of adolescents. This research is innovative in that we will follow our preschool longitudinal sample through 12th grade. We include both English and dual-language learner samples. We will include both breadth and depth of cognitive, psychological, and ecological factors, and we will examine factors such as text type and presentation medium.

Fatigue is the most significant symptom in MPN patients, reported by 80% to 95% of patients, and the symptom patients would most like to resolve because of its impact on their ability to work, participate in activities of daily living, and socialize with friends (e.g., 20% of MPN  patients  take  early  retirement;  26%  spend  at  least  1-3  days  completely  in  bed  each  month).  A  key component to the development and progression of fatigue is elevated inflammation, which is more severe and chronic  than  solid  tumor  malignancies.  Additionally,  elevated  inflammation  has  been  associated  with  higher fatigue and lower survival. Curative therapy (allogeneic stem cell transplantation reserved for <10% of patients) and  current  pharmacologic  therapies  for  MPNs  often  leave  patients  with  residual  fatigue  and  elevated inflammation. An exploration of complementary, non-pharmacologic approaches is warranted.  Yoga has the potential to improve both fatigue and inflammation, however, this has not been studied in the context of disease-related chronic fatigue and chronic inflammation in hematological cancers. In contrast to short-term yoga programs that can be delivered in-person to solid tumor patients in cancer treatment centers to resolve  their  treatment-related  fatigue,  chronic  hematological  cancer  patients  need access  to  long-term  yoga programs that they can maintain during the ongoing years of disease. While there is much evidence to support the benefits of yoga in patient groups, online yoga has not been tested in a well-powered RCT. Cancer patients, including  MPN  patients,  are  geographically  dispersed  with  various  distances  from  cancer  centers  or  yoga studios.  Online  yoga  alleviates  transportation  and  scheduling  barriers  to  participate  in  in-person  programs currently offered to patients. Online yoga could build upon the existing scientific evidence for the benefits of yoga and  expand  how  we  reach  broader  and  more  diverse  patient  populations  with  non-pharmacologic  treatment approaches, including special populations such as MPN. We  propose  a  randomized  controlled  trial  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  a  6-month  home-based, online-streamed yoga intervention (60 mins/wk yoga) on fatigue and inflammatory biomarkers IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a) in MPN patients (N=324) as compared to an active stretch and tone control group (60 mins/wk exercise). Furthermore, we will explore the long-term (12 months) effects of online yoga on secondary health outcomes (symptom burden, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and pain) as well as the sustained use of online yoga. This  study  plays  a  key  role  in  our  understanding  of  yoga  in  MPN  patients  and  is  the  first  to  test  an innovative, complementary approach to self-manage fatigue and inflammation in MPN patients. This study will provide  the needed efficacy data  to  support  future effectiveness  trials  such  as online  vs  in-person  yoga  and dissemination studies to other cancer patients.  ",
FP00020293,94,,,,,1,,,"More than five million Americans have experienced incarceration of a parent during childhood. Rates of parental incarceration have increased dramatically over the past four decades and disproportionately affect African American, Native American, and Latino children. Children with an incarcerated parent (CIP) are at risk for substance use due to multiple stressors associated with parental incarceration, including separation from parents, exposure to traumatic events, parental substance use, and poverty. Positive parenting behaviors (e.g., warmth, communication, and effective discipline) are known to prevent substance use among vulnerable children in a range of stressful circumstances, including parental incarceration. Because of the loss of financial, emotional, and co-parenting support, many CIP caregivers experience challenges in using positive parenting. Evidence-based parenting programs (EBPPs) have been shown to prevent adolescent substance use by enhancing positive parenting in other populations. However, no evidence-based programs have been designed to prevent CIP substance use by enhancing positive parenting of caregivers who bear the day-to-day responsibility for raising CIP. Moreover, most EBPPs were developed without a focus on scalability, and few have been disseminated widely, limiting potential public health impact. We will use the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to develop a parenting program for CIP caregivers that is effective, affordable, scalable, and efficient (EASE). The proposed R34 comprises the first phase of MOST: Preparation. The objectives for the Preparation phase are to specify the programs conceptual model, identify key constraints related to successful scale-up, and pilot intervention components for acceptability and feasibility. We will use a well-established, community-centered program adaptation model to specify the conceptual model and ensure that the program meets the needs of the diverse families affected by incarceration.

FP00020327_Res1,96,,,,,1,,,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are at risk for a range of significant communication problems. Dysarthria affects approximately 50% of the population and has well-documented detrimental effects on speech intelligibility, with the articulatory subsystem being the single largest contributor to speech intelligibility deficits. Our NIH-supported research has generated perhaps the largest and most fully characterized speech database in the world of children who have CP and their typical peers. This work has resulted in the first published growth curves for speech intelligibility, and the ability to predict longer term outcomes from early speech production features. Results have materially advanced our ability to make evidence-based recommendations for general treatment directions. Yet, the remaining challenge is to develop precision interventions for these children that can effectively improve speech intelligibility in the unique context of dysarthria and individual child-level patterns of growth and development. In this research we will leverage our large speech database and recent technological advancements in automatic speech recognition technology that allow for fine-grained continuous measures of articulatory precision at the level of the individual phoneme, as indicated by a probabilistic log likelihood ratio between the acoustic features of child-produced target phonemes and adult-produced target phonemes. We will refine an automated, objective speech assessment tool that is based on deep-learning of an acoustic model for every phoneme in context, and use this tool to develop benchmarks for articulatory precision by age. This research will test and validate our novel speech precision tool and its output metric on a large sample of typically developing children and children with cerebral palsy (CP). The aims of the proposed research will 1) quantify how articulatory precision in typically developing children grows from age 3 to age 10, develop reference growth curves for overall articulatory precision and for individual phonemes, and use the developmental trajectories to show when particular phonemes improve most rapidly; 2) quantify how articulatory precision at the phoneme level affects speech intelligibility, examining how overall precision affects intelligibility and which specific phonemes (or classes of phonemes) contribute the most intelligibility; and 3) characterize the development of articulatory precision and intelligibility in a longitudinal sample of children with cerebral palsy. These contributions are significant because age-level benchmarks for articulatory precision can be used for identification of speech disorders and for fine-grained measurement of treatment progress for clinical populations. Clarifying the impact of articulation precision in individual phonemes on speech intelligibility also allow precision interventions to improve intelligibility for a given child. Results will have broad application to other populations of children with speech disorders (e.g., childhood apraxia of speech, deaf speech, and cleft palate speech)",

Research suggests that deleterious outcomes are additionally driven by the first-year university transition, a developmental period characterized by multiple new stressors and associated with significant maladaptive behaviors including: poor sleep quality, emotional eating, and increased alcohol usemaking this a doubly vulnerable time of negotiating two life transitions. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have gained momentum to address stress and associated outcomes across college populations. Koru Mindfulness (KM) is a mindfulness/stress management program delivered in 4-weekly classes (75-minutes), in-person or live online, with app-based homework and practice. The in-person KM program was developed and standardized for college-age and emerging adult (EA), populations, and shows initial evidence for decreased stress and sleep problems and increased mindfulness and self-compassion. KM has not been field tested employing the online (KM-O) format; there is a need for refinement and feasibility testing. Additionally, because there is no time/attention/format matched control intervention, there is a need to develop an appropriate education control group (EdCG) to enable rigorous testing in a later RCT. Our plan is to establish a student advisory group (SAG) (in Phase I) to refine the intervention (KM-O) and develop/beta-test the control (EdCG) which will be feasibility tested in Phase II.     In Phase I we will run a full 4-week KM-O program to examine a group (N= 14) of moderate to highly stressed (score>14 on Perceived Stress Scale-10) first-year university students (ages 18-25) who will serve as the SAG. SAG members will attend and complete the intervention while evaluating and providing feedback on cues for adherence/engagement, content, and delivery style. Study staff will use noted information to further refine the intervention and identify/characterize necessary online components which will be used as fidelity checklists in Phase II. Further, during Phase I we will develop and beta-test a live, online EdCG (unrelated to mindfulness/stress reduction) matched for time, facilitator interaction, engagement, and homework type/time.     In Phase II, we will conduct a pilot RCT to determine feasibility, practicality, acceptability and trends for changes in response to the intervention (KM-O) and control (EdCG).

FP00020368_Res1,98,,,,,1,,,"Obesity is a deadly and very costly disease in the United States because it substantially increases the risk for heart disease, stroke, many cancers, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which together account for 50% of all deaths1-5. Men and women differ in their susceptibility to obesity-related disorders. Young, premenopausal women have a lower incidence of cardiometabolic disease compared to age-matched men6,7. Estrogen is a primary protective factor impacting this sex-difference. After menopause, when circulating estrogens decline, a womans risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and heart disease increases by 60%8-10. When women take estrogen shortly after menopause onset, the risk of T2D and heart disease is lower compared to postmenopausal women without estrogen treatment11,12. Although estrogens have complex functions, they generally protect women from cardiometabolic dysfunction.The circadian system is also a critical player in the regulation of metabolism and obesity13. Circadian rhythms are ~24-hour cycles of behavior and physiology that are generated by a network of molecular clocks located in nearly every tissue in the body. These clocks are entrained by environmental cues such as food and light, and are typically synchronized with environmental light-dark cycles. Studies of shift workers, who have disordered exposure to food and light, show that disruption of the circadian system increases risk of obesity, heart disease, MetS, and T2D14-18. Our overall objectives are to elucidate the circadian mechanisms that regulate metabolism and to test interventions that target the circadian system and are effective in humans. Most studies to date have investigated circadian regulation of obesity and diabetes in males19-23. We and others have shown that high-fat diet feeding in male mice profoundly disrupts daily rhythms (e.g. food intake rhythm, physical activity) and that this circadian disruption causes diet-induced obesity19,20,24,25. In contrast, very little is known about the interplay between circadian rhythms and metabolism in females. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the interaction between estrogen signaling, time-restricted feeding, and circadian rhythms in regulating obesity and its comorbidities in mice and women. Our proposed studies are strongly supported by preliminary data showing that: 1) daily rhythms of eating behavior and locomotor activity, as well as circadian timekeeping in the liver, are not disrupted by high-fat diet feeding in female mice that are also resistant to diet-induced obesity26; 2) daily metabolic rhythms are profoundly disrupted after removal of circulating estrogens by ovariectomy in females26; 3) estradiol treatment of ovariectomized females restores protection of daily metabolic rhythms during high-fat feeding; 4) Post-menopausal women, who have very low estrogens, have disrupted daily rhythms of eating, and this disruption is associated with metabolic risk27,28; 5) restoring the daily rhythm of eating to ovariectomized female mice (a preclinical model of post-menopausal women) using time-restricted feeding, inhibits diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance29. Based on these data, we will test the central hypothesis that daily metabolic rhythms are regulated by estrogen signaling and are therapeutic targets to treat obesity and pre-diabetes in post-menopausal women. We will investigate the estrogen signaling mechanisms that regulate daily rhythms underlying diet-induced obesity in mice. Because the routine use of estrogens in women is impractical, we will determine if a time-restricted feeding intervention will improve insulin sensitivity in metabolically-unhealthy post-menopausal women under free-living conditions. Aim 1: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which estradiol protects daily metabolic rhythms from disruption by high-fat feeding in mice. We will investigate the molecular estrogen signaling mechanisms that regulate eating and locomotor activity rhythms and the phase of the liver circadian clock in mice. We will study these me",

Such feedback is critical as it can provide early warning of upward weighttrends and reinforcing feedback concerning downward trends or maintenance of an appropriate body weight. Acommon frustration in taking frequent weight measurements, however, is that in the short term, most weightvariation is due to changes in water balance. With regard to weight management, such changes representnoise from which the true trend in weight can be extracted and used to gauge actual progress with respectto weight goals. Furthermore, the key quantity of interest concerning body weight (W) is anhydrous FM, asincreases in fat-free mass (FFM), which is largely muscle mass, are generally considered to be desirable.The proposed R21 eort will assess WeighTrak, a novel, low-cost, weight management approach based onconsumer-grade body composition (BC) scale measurements of W and FM% and their integration via unscentedparticle ltering (UPF), an extension of Kalman ltering that can approximate the ideal Bayesian estimator evenwhen the system being modeled is nonlinear and/or its noise properties are non-Gaussian. Optimal processingof W and FM% measurements will enable more precise feedback of energy imbalance, minimizing variationsdue to body water and FFM, which will then be presented to users in units of Calories rather than pounds orpercentages. We hypothesize that such feedback will be more meaningful to users and result in better weightmanagement. During an initial 3-month period, subjects will undergo a 5% loss in body weight via caloricrestriction. Subjects will then attempt to maintain their weight loss for 12 months subsequent to their randomizedenrollment into one of two dierent experimental groups. Treatment Group 1 will receive conventional dailyfeedback of W (lbs) along with a graph of W vs. time (days) and a maintenance W reference line.

With regard to weight management, such changes represent noisefrom which the true trend in weight can be extracted and used to gauge actual progress with respect to weightgoals. Furthermore, the key quantity of interest concerning body weight (W) is anhydrous FM, as increases infat-free mass (FFM), which is largely muscle mass, are generally considered to be desirable.The proposed R21 effort will assess WeighTrak, a novel, low-cost, weight management approach based onconsumer-grade body composition scale measurements of W and FM% and their integration via unscentedparticle filtering (UPF), an extension of Kalman filtering that can approximate the ideal Bayesian estimator evenwhen the system being modeled is nonlinear and/or its noise properties are non-Gaussian. Optimal processingof W and FM% measurements will enable more precise feedback of energy imbalance, minimizing variationsdue to body water and FFM, which will then be presented to users in units of Calories rather than pounds orpercentages. We hypothesize that such feedback will be more meaningful to users and result in better weightmanagement. During an initial 3-month period, subjects will undergo a 5% loss in body weight via caloricrestriction. They will then attempt to maintain their weight loss for 12 months subsequent to their randomizedenrollment into one of two different experimental groups. Treatment Group 1 will receive conventional dailyfeedback of W (lbs) along with a graph of W vs. time (days) and a maintenance W reference line. TreatmentGroup 2 will receive WeighTrak feedback based on the UPF-computed changes in FM values (Calories/day)along with a graph of cumulative FM change (Calories) vs. time (days) and a zero caloric change reference line.",

FP00020638,102,,,,,1,,,"ABSTRACT A low-quality diet in the United States is currently a major challenge in public health promotion and is a leading modifiable risk factor for chronic disease. In terms of gut microbial composition, diet  quality  is  one  of  the  primary  influencers.  Not  surprisingly,  a  low-quality  diet  pattern  is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, which may promote low-grade, chronic inflammation, alterations  in  microbial  metabolic  end  products,  and  disruptions  in  gastrointestinal  function.  In recent years, probiotics have been proposed as a therapeutic option to potentially modulate the gut  microbiota  and  host  health.  Probiotics  are  defined  as  live  microorganisms  which,  when administered  in  adequate  amounts  confer  a  health  benefit  on  the  host. Considering  the  wide-spread use of probiotics in the United States and the generally low-diet quality of Americans, it remains unclear if probiotic use in those individuals characterized by a low-diet quality affects gut ecology. Moreover, evidence of an impact of probiotics on inflammation, microbial metabolism, and  clinical  parameters  are  lacking  in  these  individuals.  Therefore,  the  proposed  research  will investigate  the  effects  of  a  novel  multistrain  probiotic  on  gut  microbial  ecology,  circulating inflammatory markers, and clinical parameters in adults consuming a low-quality diet as defined by  the  Healthy  Eating  Index-2015.  In  addition,  we  seek  to  determine  whether  these  potential changes  persist  after  cessation  of  probiotic  administration.  To  accomplish  these  aims,  a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial will be performed in healthy adult volunteers  with  a  low-quality  diet.  Fifty  middle-aged  (35-65  years  old)  participants  will  be randomized into two groups and complete a 14-week study period, consisting of: 1) a four-week intervention, 2) a four-week wash-out, 3) a four-week crossover to the other intervention, and 4) a two-week follow up. At in-clinic visits, fecal samples (collected prior at participants residence), blood  draws,  and  questionnaires  (including  diet  recall,  physical  activity,  and  gastrointestinal function)  will  be  obtained  at  baseline,  week-four,  week-eight  (after group  crossover),  week  12, and week 14 (follow up). We hypothesize that the probiotic will: 1) increase transient colonization of  targeted  strains,  2)  significantly  and  positively facilitate greater GM  diversity,  3)  significantly alter circulating inflammatory  markers, and 4) significantly improve GI symptoms, compared to placebo in adults consuming a low-quality diet. Findings from this study are expected to examine the  role  of  a  novel  multistrain  probiotic  as  a  viable  dietary  supplement  that  can  easily  be incorporated by individuals to improve indices of gut health and systemic inflammation. Given the prevalence and associated health costs of low-quality diet, a simple, dietary strategy capable of influencing the gut microbiota and related health outcomes is of significant health and financial importance, and will advance current nutritional knowledge.

FP00020691,104,,,,,1,,,"This proposal directly addresses the FY19 PRMRP Topic Area related to frontotemporal degeneration. We will develop and validate digital biomarkers for monitoring cognition in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This is especially important for military populations as several Institute of Medicine reports suggest an association between military service and higher risk for FTD and ALS.Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by muscle weakness; however, almost 30% of ALS patients also present with dementia consistent with frontotemporal degeneration. However current clinical practice focuses solely on motor symptoms. Cognitive tests are not performed because they are resource intensive and are often difficult for patients with ALS to complete.  This lack of outcome measures has been the rate-limiting factor in developing FTD diagnostics and therapeutics to diagnose and treat FTD symptoms in ALS.Rationale: In contrast to other dementias, FTD is characterized by more pronounced speech and language changes, including reduced verbal output; increased pausing between words; reduced vocabulary size; and reduced language complexity. To detect and track these changes, we propose to develop and validate a family of speech-based digital biomarkers collected in-clinic or at home using mobile technology. Our analytics will generate an objective, fine-grained panel of speech and language measures (PSLM) to document change. Hypothesis: There are two primary hypotheses proposed in this project:1.A constellation of PSLM measures will sensitively detect cognitive impairment in patients with ALS with cognitive symptoms when compared against patients with ALS without cognitive symptoms.2.The PSLM measures that capture cognitive symptoms will longitudinally track with existing measures of cognitive decline (the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment).Specific Aims and Objectives: The objective of the proposed research study is to determine whether the PSLM can detect and longitudinally track cognitive decline in patients diagnosed with ALS. The two hypotheses listed above are aligned with this objective. They will be evaluated by the following proposed specific aims:1.Aim 1 (SA1): Determine whether the PSLM can detect abnormalities consistent with cognitive dysfunction in ALS patients2.Aim 2 (SA2): Determine the extent to which abnormalities in identified motor speech, language, cognition and affect parameters change over time, as well as how such changes correlated with the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)Study Design:  To augment existing data, we will recruit 25 participants with ALS and cognitive symptoms and 25 with ALS but without cognitive symptoms. Speech samples will be collected using the mobile app for 18 months. The participants will also complete in-clinic neuropsychological batteries (including the PSLM, the ALS-CBS, and the MoCA) once every three months. We will extract the PSLM measures from all speech samples. For SA1, we will use a cross-sectional analysis (logistic regression and two-sample t-tests) to determine which PSLM measures (or groups of PSLM measures) are different between the ALS group+cognitive symptoms and ALS-cognitive symptoms. SA2 will use a linear mixed effects model to determine which PSLM measures track with the ALS-CBS and the MoCA.Impact:  If successfully validated, this cognitive battery test will enable earlier detection of cognitive decline consistent with FTD in the context of ALS; and enable pharmaceutical companies to integrate these digital outcomes in clinical trials as endpoints, eventually leading to new clinical trials targeting FTD in ALS. Given the increased prevalence of both FTD and ALS in military populations, this has the potential for a significant impact on this vulnerable population.",
FP00020711,105,,,,,1,,,"This study aims to gain knowledge on the level of vitamin C in a military relevant population and this knowledge will facilitate future interventions to optimize the vitamin C level in military populations and civilians. It is a common belief that low vitamin C levels in the blood, known as scurvy, does not exist anymore. Although, the prevalence of scurvy is quite rare (7% of the U.S. population), about 30% of U.S. adults have below adequate vitamin C levels in blood. This is a condition termed sub-clinical scurvy. Symptoms of sub-clinical scurvy are vague and often go unreported: fatigue, depressive feelings, and increased respiratory tract infections. Screening of vitamin C levels in the blood is not a standard measurement and therefore this specific low vitamin C levels easily go unnoted. This results in generalized malaise, which influences well-being, physical performance, and mental function. In the U.S., the dietary recommendations (RDAs) are based on the avoidance of disease protecting individuals from frank scurvy; however, the RDA is not designed to optimize health and performance. As a result, non-healthy or highly stressed individuals need more vitamin C than recommended. Individuals under mental or physical stress likely need dietary intakes above that specified by the RDAs. Based on the national survey data suggesting that 30% of Americans have low vitamin C levels in blood and it is very likely that this is also the case for military service members. Furthermore, since military service members experience a high degree of mental and physical stress, their vitamin C needs are likely above that specified by the RDA. Thus, vitamin C status of populations experiencing a high amount of (physical and-or mental) stress should be assessed and related to performance indicators. If vitamin C status is related to suboptimal performance and-or physical or mental, this is easily remedied by supplementation or diet changes for both military service members and their civilian counterparts.This study proposal addresses the area of Nutrition Optimization that is part of the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program. Our plan focuses on two areas of encouragement: (a) The development and/or validation of improved nutrition strategies for physical and/or cognitive performance enhancement and sustainment in operational environments and efforts to optimize nutrition in resource-limited settings and (b) Research on the impact of the use of dietary supplements (e.g., vitamins, probiotics, protein powders) on the physical and/or cognitive performance, including the readiness of military service members.",

FP00020844,107,,,,,1,,,"  Identifying Metabolic Differences during Pregnancy in Mothers of Children Later Diagnosed with ASD  Abstract:   Background: Previous studies have demonstrated significant abnormalities in the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism/transsulfuration (FOCM/TS) pathways of mothers of children with ASD compared to typically-developing controls.  In a pilot study we have confirmed those findings and identified an additional 45 metabolites that are significantly different in the ASD group, representing 5 general categories of metabolic dysfunction related to folate, vitamin B12, and carnitine.  A statistical model with only 5 representative metabolites allows us to differentiate the ASD and control groups with 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity.   Specific Aim:  We will measure the levels of key metabolites in maternal blood during pregnancy where the children developed ASD or were typically-developing (TD).   Proposed work:  We will access existing blood samples from the prospective nuMom2b pregnancy cohort involving 8 sites and 10,038 pregnancies.  We will identify children who either developed ASD or were TD.  We will measure metabolites in first-trimester blood samples,  and  conduct  similar  analyses  as  in  our  previous  work  to  identify  metabolite profiles, that predict development of ASD.   Impact:  If successful, this study will result in a diagnostic test for risk of having a child with ASD, and may suggest treatments during pregnancy such as folate, vitamin B12, and carnitine for ASD prevention.       Specific Aim:  Measure the levels of key metabolites in maternal blood during pregnancy where the children developed ASD or were typically-developing (TD).  The metabolites include 5 general categories of metabolites we found to be abnormal in post-pregnancy samples of mothers of children with ASD, and we hypothesize that similar abnormalities exist during pregnancy.    Background and Previous Work ASD is due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors, both of which can affect metabolism. Previous studies have revealed significant abnormalities in the folate-dependent  one  carbon  metabolism/transsulfuration  (FOCM/TS)  pathways  of mothers of children with autism (James et al 2008, 2010) and in children with ASD (James 2004,  Adams  2011,  Howsmon  2017),  resulting  in  decreased  methylation  capability, decreased glutathione levels, and increased oxidative stress.  Statistical analysis by our team  revealed  that  metabolites  from  the  FOCM/TS  pathway  alone  had  the  ability  to identify the risk level of mothers for having a child with ASD (Hollowood 2018). In order to better understand maternal metabolic risk factors for ASD, we conducted a pilot study, the ASU-Mayo Pilot Study of Young Children with ASD and their Mothers (AMPSYCAM), which investigated 30 young children with ASD ages 2-5 years and their mothers, and 30 typically-developing children ages 2-5 years and their mothers.  The study was limited to women who were not taking folate, B12, or multi-vitamin/mineral supplements during the 2 months prior to sample collection, so that it would reflect their metabolic status due to their diet alone, without supplementation.  The study included assessments of many different aspects of metabolism, including analysis of amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleotides, Krebs cycle, vitamins/co-factors, and xenobiotics. In total, we analyzed twenty metabolites related to the FOCM/TS pathway (measured by Jill James at Univ. of Arkansas), vitamins/minerals (folate, B12, methylmalonic acid, ferritin, vitamin E) measured by Mayo Clinic, and 595 metabolites measured by Metabolon, for a total of 621 metabolites.  Our initial univariate analysis revealed that 5 metabolites of the FOCM/TS pathway and 45 additional metabolites were significantly different between the mothers of children with ASD (ASD-M) and the mothers of typically developing children (TD-M), with p<0.05 and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.10.  It is important to use methods such as FDR when dealing with large data sets to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. We also calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each metabolite. The fifty metabolites that produced the highest AUC were used for Fisher Discriminant Analysis. Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is a method to search for the sets of metabolites which best discriminate between the ASD-M and TD-M groups.  All combinations involving two through five metabolites were studied.  Each combination was then assessed for its specificity/sensitivity using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (Kohavi, 1995). Leave-one-out cross-validation removes the first participant, determines a best-fit model using the n-1 participants, and then applies this model to the first participant. This application is designed to determine whether the first participant is correctly classified to the ASD-M or TD-M group, or misclassified. Repeating this   procedure until each of the participants is left out once allows the calculation of the overall rate of correctly classified and misclassified participants; i.e.,  the number of true and false positives as well as the number of true and false negatives for the participants left out, i.e. independently, and with it the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity metrics. This leave-one-out cross validation is an important method to determine which combination of metabolites is the most accurate for classification.  The results for the best models for 2, 3, 4, and 5 metabolites are shown below in Table 1.  There were many other combinations that resulted in similar accuracy because many metabolites were significantly correlated.  The model with only 2 metabolites does reasonably well (83% sensitivity and 87% specificity) and increasing the number of metabolites improves the model further, with the 5 metabolite model having a 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Table 1: The best combinations of 2-5 metabolites that yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity 83% Specificity 87% Metabolites 2 metabolites: Histidylglutamate, 6-hy-droxyindoel sulfate 3 metabolites: Histidylglutamate, N-formylanthranilic acid, pal-mitoylcarnitine (C16) 4 metabolites:  Histidylglutamate, S-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, N-acetyl-2-aminooctano-ate*, 5-methylthioadeno-sine (MTA) 5-metabolites: Glu-Cys, histidylgluta-mate, cinnamoylglycine, proline, adrenoylcarnitine (C22:4) 93% 97% 97% 93% 93%  97%    We then analyzed the 5 key metabolites of the 5-metabolite model.  As expected, they had low correlation with one another (R2 <0.02), but they each had significant correlations with 8-15 of the top 50 metabolites.  In other words, each of the 5 key metabolites actually represents a distinct cluster of 8-15 metabolites that are significantly correlated with it, but which have little correlation with those in other clusters.  Thus, they seem to represent 5 different metabolic areas that are significantly different in mothers of young children with ASD vs. controls.  Three of these areas (Glu-Cys, cinnamoylglycine, and proline) are related to metabolites of the FOCM/TS pathway, and two of them (histidylglutatmate and adrenoylcarnitine) include several   short-chain and long-chain carnitines, respectively, and almost all carnitines are generally significantly lower in the ASD-M group.   The 5-metabolite model needs validation in a larger study, but it suggests that it may be possible to develop a diagnostic tool for identifying mothers at high risk of having a child with autism.  Our pilot study was limited to mothers 2-5 years after they gave birth. However, we believe the results suggest that it may be possible to develop a similar model for mothers during their pregnancy. Also, the observation of 5 abnormal metabolic pathways in the ASD-M group suggests that nutritional interventions could be used to normalize some of those pathways in the mothers and possibly reduce the risk of ASD in their children.  In fact, a meta-analysis of 12 studies (Wang 2017) found that supplementation with folic acid during pregnancy results in a significantly reduced risk of ASD in their children, with some studies suggesting that folic acid supplementation during the first two months of pregnancy is most important.  Levels of folate were lower in the ASD-M group, and were significantly correlated with two of the 5 key metabolites (Glu-cys and proline).  Similarly, vitamin B12 levels were significantly lower in the ASD-M group, and significantly correlated with 6 of the top 50 metabolites, and one study (Raghavan 2018) found that abnormal maternal levels of vitamin B12 was associated with an increased risk of ASD, but one small study (Chen 2016) found no association. Vitamin B12 and folate work together in recycling of homocysteine to methionine, a key step of the FOCM/TS pathway.  Similarly, two of the 5 key metabolites (histidylglutatmate and adrenoylcarnitine) are significantly correlated to several short and long-chain carnitines, respectively, which were significantly lower in the ASD-M group, which suggests that maternal carnitine supplementation during pregnancy may also help reduce the risk of ASD.  Carnitine is critical for normal mitochondrial function.  Overall, our data suggests that supplementation with folate, B12, and carnitine may reduce the risk of ASD, consistent with studies by our group (Adams 2011, Geier 2011) and others (James 2004) that have shown that those nutrients are also effective treatments for children and adults with ASD.  So, if folate supplementation reduces the risk of ASD by approximately 40% if taken during the first two months of pregnancy, it is possible that additional supplementation with appropriate levels of vitamin B12 and carnitine may lower the risk further. These pilot results for post-pregnancy, if confirmed in the proposed study during pregnancy, could form the justification for a clinical trial of supplementation during pregnancy to reduce risk and/or severity of ASD.  Research Plan: Participants:  For this study we will access existing blood samples from the multi-center NIH-funded nuMoM2b study.  The nuMom2b study (Haas 2015) is one of the largest and most comprehensive pregnancy studies in the US, involving 8 sites and 10,038 pregnancies.  That study collected extensive medical data and blood and urine samples during pregnancy, including first-trimester blood samples which we will use for this study.  All samples have been stored at -80oC. The leaders of the nuMom2b study have agreed to collaborate on this study.  They have email and phone contact information for all participants, and permission to contact nearly all of them again for   future studies.  The nuMom2b study site staff will contact the women and invite them to participate in the proposed study.  Based on an ASD rate of 1 in 59 children, we estimate that approximately 170 children in the study will have gone on to develop ASD.  In this pilot study we plan to enroll the mothers of 35 children with ASD and the mothers of 35 who are typically-developing (TD). Nearly all of the nuMoM2b participants have consented to be recontacted for future studies. Indeed, over 7,000 of them have had phone recontact over the subsequent 7 years and 4,500 women participated in a study visit as part of the nuMoM2b-Heart Health Study, funded by NHLBI. Thus, the nuMoM2b teams have demonstrated an ability to retain this cohort for additional research. We will optimize activities for this grant by integrating with ongoing contact protocols for the cohort. The nuMoM2b teams are currently utilizing multimodal strategies to maintain the cohort, including telephone calls, text messaging, social media, electronic communications, and others. These strategies have been very successful. For example, at the Indiana University nuMoM2b site, of 748 eligible nuMoM2b participants, we successfully recontacted 632 (84%) by phone and were able to bring 515 (81%) of those women in for a research study visit 2-7 years after their nuMoM2b pregnancy ended. Thus, we are confident that we will be successful at recruiting the necessary number of ASD cases and TD controls within the cohort.  The nuMoM2b sites have agreed to contact eligible study participants and ask them to complete a child medical history form which includes a question about whether or not their child developed ASD, or if any of their other children have ASD.  Of note, all of the children from nuMoM2b pregnancies are currently 5-9 years old, thus allowing sufficient time for a diagnosis of ASD to have been made in most cases.  The ASD diagnosis will be confirmed by ASU staff by phone interview using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) parent questionnaire.  The TD group will be evaluated using the SRS and a review of their medical history to confirm that they are typically-developing. After completion of recruiting of the cohort of 35 ASD cases and 35 TD controls, the corresponding first trimester blood samples will be identified and sent to the Gu lab at ASU for metabolomics analysis.  Metabolomics Measurements and Analysis:   We will analyze the blood samples in two phases.  In the first phase, we will use semi-quantitative metabolomics to measure over 300 aqueous metabolites and over 300 lipids, including the 50 metabolites we found to be abnormal in our pilot study.  We will determine which metabolites are significantly different between the ASD-M and ASD-TD group during pregnancy.  We will carry out simultaneous profiling of both polar and nonpolar metabolomes using our state-of-the-art metabolomics mass spectrometry (MS) platforms (Carroll 2015, Gu 2015, Jasbi 2019). The careful choice of analytes that will be measured reflects information gleaned from the literature and our own previous research, which includes lipids, nucleosides, organic and amino acids, and a broad range of other metabolites that are closely related to ASD.   We expect results similar to what we found in our post-pregnancy study. In the 2nd phase, we will focus on the 30-40 metabolites of highest interest, and re-measure them quantitatively with standards. This re-measurement will yield a much   higher precision, which will enhance the reliability of our approach.  These significant metabolites will be ported to our highly reproducible and sensitive targeted LC-MS/MS platform. We will optimize the LC-MS/MS system using metabolite standards, and important parameters mainly include precursor ion, product ion, collision voltage, and retention times (RTs). For study samples, targeted data acquisition will be performed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode, due to significant advantages of great selectivity and excellent quantitation. Samples will be run with a set of internal or external standards such that we can determine absolute concentrations of the selected metabolites. We will then use our FDA methods with cross-validation to develop the best models for 2, 3, 4, and 5 metabolites; we expect those models to be similar to our current post-pregnancy models.  We will also use cluster analysis methods to determine which metabolites are grouped together in clusters of abnormal metabolites, and work on interpreting the biological significance of those abnormalities     Plans for future funding:  If this study is successful, we will use the results to justify a much larger proposal to NIH, focused on verifying the results in the entire nuMoM2b cohort, and also investigating blood samples during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  List of publications and summary of follow-up grants obtained as a result of previously awarded grants from ARI: One ARI Grant on Human Intestinal Microbial Ecology and Its Relationship to Autism led to a publication .  Kang D-W, Park et al., Reduced incidence of Prevotella and other fermenters in intestinal microflora of autistic children, PLoS One. 2013 Jul 3;8(7).  This pilot study led to several grants (approximately $2 million) and papers on further studies of gut bacteria in autism, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials of microbiota transplant.  One ARI Grant on Metabolomics Analysis of Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Their Mothers Compared to Neurotypical Controls.  This pilot study found significant differences in the urine of the children with ASD, but less significant differences in their mothers.  This pilot study led to a grant from the ASU catalyst fund, and a submitted NIH proposal (pending), focused on children with ASD.  Impact/Innovation: 1)  Early Detection:  If successful, this study will develop a diagnostic test to determine which mothers are at high risk of having a child who will develop ASD.   2)  Early Personalized Intervention:  If successful, this study will also suggest personalized interventions (such as folate, B12, and carnitine supplementation) which could be investigated in future studies as possible treatments during pregnancy to reduce the risk and/or severity of ASD.

FP00020868,108,,,,,1,,,"Attachment 3: Technical Abstract   Background: There is substantial evidence that pathogenic gut bacteria including primarily certain harmful Clostridia species are increased in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.  Previous clinical trials have suggested that elimination of those harmful species and the re-establishment of normal GI microbiota results in a reduction of GI and ASD symptoms.  CRS3123 is a novel narrow spectrum antibiotic with activity primarily targeting Clostridia species with little activity against the major groups of normal GI microbiota.  It has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in Phase 1 studies involving healthy adult volunteers.  It is well suited for studies in children with ASD who have severe GI symptoms and are colonized with potentially harmful Clostridia species, including C. bolteae and C. perfringens. Hypothesis: A novel narrow-spectrum antibiotic, CRS3123, will safely and effectively eliminate or reduce harmful Clostridium species in the subset of children with ASD, GI disorders, and the presence of these bacteria.  In addition, treatment with CRS3123 will lead to a reduction in both GI symptoms as well as some ASD-related symptoms. Specific Aims 1)  Estimate safety and tolerability of CRS3123 in children with ASD. Safety and tolerability of multiple doses of CRS3123 will be assessed by monitoring reported adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, pharmacokinetics, and comprehensive laboratory testing.  Labs tests will include serum chemistry, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, and urinalysis. 2)  Estimate efficacy of CRS3123 on improving microbiota composition and function. We will use a combination of complementary methods (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, qPCR (quantitative PCR), metagenomics) to hopefully confirm that, similar to our previous animal and human studies, CRS3123 is able to dramatically reduce levels of harmful Clostridia in children with ASD with minimal effect on commensal bacteria and short chain fatty acid production, and minimal increase of antibiotic resisting bacteria. We will continue these evaluations for 6 months post-treatment, to determine if a single course is sufficient or if additional courses may be needed in some cases. 3)  Estimate the efficacy of CRS3123 on GI and ASD-related symptoms. We will evaluate changes from baseline in GI and ASD-related symptoms with a combination of assessment tools, including daily stool record, gastrointestinal assessments, and assessments of ASD-related symptoms, both during treatment and afterward. This will provide crucial information for planning larger studies to determine safety and efficacy. Most assessments will be the same as we used for our microbiota transplant study, so that we can directly compare the results of CRS3123 therapy with microbiota transplant therapy.  Screening:   We will screen 60 children with ASD and GI disorders to identify 30 with the highest levels of harmful Clostridia in their stool.  We will also evaluate 30 matched controls of typically-developing (TD) children (baseline only, no treatment) for comparison.   Treatment:  Thirty (30) children with ASD, a minimum GI severity score, and at least one (1) identified Clostridium pathogen, will be enrolled and randomized to receive oral CRS3123 or oral placebo in a double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CRS3123 compared to placebo. Study Design:  Impact:  This study will investigate an entirely new treatment for pathogenic Clostridia bacteria in children with ASD.  It is likely to be highly effective at least temporarily, and possibly in the long term.  Even if the benefits are only temporary in some cases, it may still be important as a much safer and more effective replacement for vancomycin in current microbiota transplant therapy (MTT), especially when an overgrowth of pathogenic Clostridia are present.   Translatability:  This pilot study will provide critical preliminary data on safety, efficacy, and duration of treatment effects.  That data will be crucial for planning future randomized clinical trials. ",
FP00020944,109,,,,,1,,,"Lay Abstract.  This study aims to gain knowledge on the level of vitamin C in a military relevant population and this knowledge will facilitate future interventions to optimize the vitamin C level in military populations and civilians. It is a common belief that low vitamin C levels in the blood, known as scurvy, does not exist anymore. Although, the prevalence of scurvy is quite rare (7% of the U.S. population), about 30% of U.S. adults have below adequate vitamin C levels in blood. This is a condition termed sub-clinical scurvy. Symptoms of sub-clinical scurvy are vague and often go unreported:  fatigue, depressive feelings, and increased respiratory tract infections. Screening of vitamin C levels in the blood is not a standard measurement and therefore this specific low vitamin C  levels  easily  go  unnoted.  This  results  in  generalized  malaise,  which  influences  well-being,  physical performance, and mental function.  In the U.S., the dietary recommendations (RDAs) are based on the avoidance of disease protecting individuals from frank scurvy; however, the RDA is not designed to optimize health and performance. As a result, non-healthy or highly stressed individuals need more vitamin C than recommended.  Individuals under mental or physical stress likely need dietary intakes above that specified by the RDAs.  Based on the national survey data suggesting that 30% of Americans have low vitamin C levels in blood and it is very likely  that  this  is  also  the  case  for  military  service  members.    Furthermore,  since  military  service  members experience a high degree of mental and physical stress, their vitamin C needs are likely above that specified by the RDA.  Thus, vitamin C status of populations experiencing a high amount of (physical and-or mental) stress should be assessed and related to performance indicators.  If vitamin C status is related to suboptimal performance and-or physical or mental, this is easily remedied by supplementation or diet changes for both military service members and their civilian counterparts.    This  study  proposal  addresses  the  area  of  Nutrition  Optimization  that  is  part  of  the  Peer  Reviewed  Medical Research Program. Our plan focuses on two areas of encouragement: (a) The development and/or validation of improved  nutrition  strategies  for  physical  and/or  cognitive  performance  enhancement  and  sustainment  in operational environments and efforts to optimize nutrition in resource-limited settings and (b) Research on the impact of the use of dietary supplements (e.g., vitamins, probiotics, protein powders) on the physical and/or cognitive performance, including the readiness of military service members.    This study will assess blood vitamin C levels of surrogate military populations (such as fire fighters, athletes and ROTC students) who have the physical ability, stamina and strength to function in demanding environments such as the battlefield or the fire ground.  The vitamin C levels will then be related to health and performance related outcomes. There is strong evidence in the research literature that vitamin C is a key substance for optimal energy production during exercise, is required for optimal brain performance, and protects the air ways from infections or inflammation. However, the link between blood levels of vitamin C with physical and mental performance in military service members and other high-performance populations has never been examined.  Vitamin C status is easily maximized by dietary supplementation or by including specific vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables in the diet daily.  The results will allow us to make recommendations about vitamin C supplementation or dietary intake changes in the military. This helps to inform the public and policy makers about the importance of vitamin C in our diet and to facilitate future research to define new military recommended dietary intakes (MRDI) for vitamin C. As this is not a clinical trial, the study aims to define the vitamin C status of high-performance individuals whose readiness for physical and mental performance is a job expectation and relevant to the community they serve.    For  this  study,  statistical  analysis  determined  that  450  participants  will  provide  adequate  information  to confidently  assess  vitamin  C  status  in  our  sample.    Participants  will  be  recruited  from  military  facilities, firehouses, and university athlete populations.  A mobile test unit is used to test exercise performance under heat stress, mental acuity, and respiratory tract function on site. Participants will receive a modest incentive for their contribution.  Statistical analyses will aid in data interpretation and allow a high level of confidence in the results.  The  outcomes  will  help  to  develop  new  recommendations  for  vitamin  C  intake  by  providing  clear  diet  and supplementation guidelines for optimizing the vitamin C status of high performing men and women.

BC  continues  to  be  a severe  threat  to  womens  health4-5.  It  is  the  most  common  cancer  and  ranks  the  second  in cancer  deaths  among  women  in  the  US.  Despite  the  many  advances  in  BC  detection  and treatment over the past decades, currently only ~61% of BC patients are diagnosed and treated with early-stage (stages I and II), localized disease when the average 5-year survival rate can be  as  high  as  99%6.  In  particular,  triple-negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC)  is  generally  more aggressive and has a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer7-13. Therefore, it is of strong significance to further develop better approaches for the early and accurate diagnosis of BC, especially TNBC.  In recent years, a sizable number of DNA and protein-related markers at the molecular level have been discovered for cancer diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and recurrence surveillance14-20. For example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations have been associated with increased risk of female BC. However, the gene-based prediction is the average outcome of a group of many women, and it is still impossible to accurately predict the outcome for any individual woman. CA 27-29,  a  mucus-containing  protein  that  is  produced  by  the  MUC-1  gene,  has  been  FDA-approved for monitoring remission and progression in BC patients, but only in more advanced stages21. Therefore, in addition to these existing molecular tests, there is still a critical need for sensitive, specific, and early diagnostics for detecting and identifying TNBC. Cancer  induces  wide  and  extensive  alterations  in  metabolism22-24,  which  provides  a promising approach to detect cancer. Metabolomics25-47, which focuses on the parallel analysis BRANDER BEACONS CANCER RESEARCH | branderbeacons.com | info@branderbeacons.com3of  hundreds  of  small  molecule  metabolites,  has  emerged  as  a  powerful  methodology  for  BC detection  and  a  better  understanding  of  BC  processes48-59.  In  fact,  our  previous  studies  also confirmed that metabolomics is an efficient approach for detecting BC in both cell models1 and blood tests2-3. Particularly, our published data3 showed that a panel of 6 plasma metabolites can  provide  an  area  under  the  receiver  operating  characteristic  curve  (AUROC)  of  0.87  for differentiating  stage  I-  and  II-BC  patients  from  healthy  controls.  However,  our  results  are  not ready for clinical settings yet due to the limitations including that 1) we only included 4 TNBC out of 102 BC samples, 2) a limited coverage of metabolome was investigated, and 3) no external validation has been performed. To  at  least  partially  address  these  fundamental  gaps,  the  overall  objective  of  this collaborative  study  is  to  use  state-of-the-art  metabolomics  profiling  methods  and  a  well-characterized biorepository to identify and validate plasma metabolite markers associated with early occurrence of TNBC. Based on our previous results1-3, our central hypothesis is that TNBC causes  unique  metabolic  patterns  in  blood,  which  provides  innovative  and  promising approaches to enable early and accurate TNBC diagnosis.  Aim 1. Validate the diagnosis performance of the panel of 6 plasma metabolites3 for early stage TNBC. We plan to obtain 100 TNBC (stages I and II), 100 non-TNBC (stages I and II), and 100 matched healthy control plasma samples (de-identified), from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer  Research  Center-Breast  Specimen  Repository  (FH-BSR)  directed  by  Dr.  Peggy  L. Porter  (consultant).  Notably,  26  samples  of  each  category have  been delivered  to  Dr.  Haiwei Gus (PI) lab. Half of these samples will be randomly selected and used for test development, and  the  remaining  samples  will  be  used  for  validating  the  tests.  We  will  examine  the performance of the panel of 6 plasma metabolites discovered in our previous study3. In addition, we will determine if combining plasma metabolites with established protein-based markers (e.g., CA 27-29) may enable superior classification. This will extend the capability of our previously developed tests from non-TNBC to early stage TNBC.   Aim  2.  Develop  and  validate  a  new  diagnostic  test  for  early  stage  TNBC,  through examining the significantly expanded metabolome. The same plasma samples as those in Aim 1 will be further analyzed, to examine >2,500 aqueous metabolites and lipids. Using bio-statistical  approaches,  we  will  seek  and  validate  the  significantly  altered  metabolites  in  early stage TNBC. We will also combine and compare them to existing diagnostic test methods (e.g., CA  27-29)  to  determine  whether  our  tests  yield  better  results.  These  steps  will  augment  and improve the sensitivity and specificity of the panel of 6 metabolites established in our previous study3. Successful  implementation  of  this  multidisciplinary  study  will  lay  the  foundation  for  the development of a novel, minimally-invasive tool to detect TNBC early and accurately, which has great  translation  potential  to  clinical  settings.  The  proposed  study  will  also  set  the  stage  for future  large-scale  studies,  which  will  leverage  the  existing  resources  to  validate  our  findings across multiple population groups. To ensure successful completion of the proposed aims, we have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with Dr. Haiwei Gu (PI) focusing on mass spectrometry-based  metabolomics,  Dr.  Xiaojian  Shi  (Postdoc)  focusing  on  MS  data  collection and mining in Omics fields, and Dr. Peggy L. Porter (consultant, see the attached Supporting Letter) specializing in pathological oncology of breast cancer.   A.  Background and Significance Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a severe threat to womens health4-5. According to the BRANDER BEACONS CANCER RESEARCH | branderbeacons.com | info@branderbeacons.com4American  Cancer  Society5,  it  is  the  most  common  cancer  in  American  women,  and  it  ranks second in cancer deaths among them. Approximately 1 in 8 women will develop BC during their lifetimes,  and  the  lifetime  chance  for  a  woman  to  die  from  BC  is  about  1  in  37.  In  particular, triple-negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC)  tests  negative  for  estrogen  receptors,  progesterone receptors,  and  HER2  protein,  which  makes  TNBC  not  responsive  to  hormone  or  anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody therapy7-13. TNBC causes a disproportionate number of BC deaths due to its  aggressive  nature,  earlier  relapses,  and  distinct  patterns  of  metastasis.  While  ~99%  of patients live longer than 5 years after diagnosis at a localized stage (stages I and II), currently only  ~61%  of  BC  patients  are  found  at  an  early  stage6,  which  causes  a  tremendous socioeconomic burden and negative impacts to the patients and their families. Early and accurate diagnosis of BC will not only improve survival, but also help clinicians and patients determine the best therapeutic strategies and thus avoid inappropriate treatment. Currently,  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  BC  relies  heavily  on  physical  examination  and  auxiliary imaging  modalities,  including  mammography,  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  scan, computed  tomography  (CT)  scan,  etc.60  However,  these  traditional  approaches  have  limited sensitivities to detect early stage lesions or tumors that show little or no imaging abnormalities61-62. Therefore, the development of more effective and reliable methods for TNBC early detection and accurate diagnosis has long been an important goal. Towards achieving effective screening, early detection, and accurate diagnosis, the analysis of  cancer  biomarkers  at  the  molecular  level  has  attracted  tremendous  attention13-20.  For example,  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  gene  mutations  have  been  associated  with  increased  risk  of female  BC.  However,  the  gene-based  prediction  is  the  average  outcome  of  a  group  of  many women, and it is still impossible to accurately predict the outcome for any individual woman. In addition, a sizable number of protein-related markers have been discovered for blood tests of BC,  including  cancer  antigen  (CA)  15-3,  carcinoembryonic  antigen  (CEA),  and  CA  27-29.  In most  cases,  however,  these  markers  are  not  sufficiently  sensitive  or  specific  to  detect  BC  at early stages or its recurrence at an early time point. For instance, CA 27-29, a mucus-containing protein that is produced by the MUC-1 gene, has been FDA-approved for monitoring remission and progression in BC patients, but only in more advanced stages21. Therefore, in addition to these existing molecular tests, new approaches are strongly desired for the early and accurate detection of BC, especially TNBC. Beyond  proteins  and  genes,  metabolite  markers  provide  a  complementary  and  promising approach to detect BC. Since metabolite levels are sensitive to subtle differences and changes in  pathological  status,  metabolomics25-40,  the  comprehensive  study  of  small  molecular-weight metabolites and their dynamic changes in biological systems, promises novel avenues for early TNBC detection and a better understanding of cancer processes48-59. In our previous studies, metabolomics  has  also  been  shown  as  a  promising  approach  for  detecting  BC  in  both  cell models1 and blood tests2-3. For example, we established a novel 6-metabolite panel of potential biomarkers that showed relatively high sensitivity (0.80), specificity (0.75), and area under the receiver-operating  characteristic  curve  (AUROC  =  0.89).  Similar  classification  performance  of the  statistical  model  was  observed  for  detection  of  early-stage  (I  and  II)  BC  (AUROC=0.87, sensitivity:  0.86,  specificity:  0.75)3.  These  studies  support  the  hypothesis  that  metabolomics profiling  can  potentially  represent  a  novel  alternative  or  adjunct  to  physical  examination  and radiologic imaging for early and accurate detection of TNBC patients.  However, our previous work has certain limitations. First, we only included 4 TNBC out of 102 BC samples; therefore, the diagnostic performance of the panel of 6 plasma metabolites for TNBC is un-determined. Second, a limited coverage of metabolome was investigated. We only had  ~250  aqueous  metabolites  in  the  detection  panel,  and  ~110  metabolites  were  actually BRANDER BEACONS CANCER RESEARCH | branderbeacons.com | info@branderbeacons.com5detected. Third, with respect to our multivariate modeling, it should be noted that our estimates of classification accuracy were obtained using the same samples used to identify the included metabolite  predictors;  thus,  external  validation  will  be  essential  to  obtain  truly  unbiased performance estimates.  Our long-term goal is to develop clinical-grade biomarker assays with significant impact on reducing morbidity and mortality associated with BC. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the onset and progression of TNBC is detectable in blood, through measurement of the changes in metabolic profiles. To at least partially address the limitations of our previous studies1-3, we will use the state-of-the-art metabolomics profiling methods and a well-characterized biorepository, the  Fred  Hutchinson  Cancer  Research  Center-Breast  Specimen  Repository  (FH-BSR).  This collaborative study seeks to identify and initially validate plasma metabolite markers associated with  TNBC.  Findings  from  this  proposal  will  help  elucidate  the  mechanism  by  which  TNBC perturbs  the  metabolic  levels  (>2,500  metabolites)  in  human  blood.  Through  identifying metabolic  vulnerabilities  induced  by  TNBC,  the  resulting  important  metabolites  and  metabolic pathways  can  be  used  for  early  and  effective  diagnosis and  treatment  targets. The  proposed study  will  set  the  stage  for  future  large-scale  studies  related  to  TNBC,  which  has  great translational potential in clinical settings. Therefore, our proposed work is of great significance.  B.  Innovation To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive metabolomics study aiming to discover novel metabolite markers of early stage (I and II) TNBC, which has strong potential to achieve  sensitive,  specific,  and  early  diagnosis  of  TNBC.  This  project  will  utilize  the  unique resources developed within the FH-BSR directed by Dr. Peggy L.

In this targeted approach, 105 metabolites from more than 35  metabolic  pathways  of  potential biological  relevance  were  reliably  detected  in  201  plasma samples  taken  from  two  groups  of  subjects  (102  BC  patients  and  99  healthy  controls).  The results  of  our  general  linear  model  and  partial  least  squares-discriminant  analysis  (PLS-DA) informed  the  construction  of  a  novel  6-metabolite  panel  of  potential  biomarkers.  As  shown  in Table  1, these  6  metabolites showed  considerable  fold  change values  (FCs)  and  significant  p-values between early stage (stage I and  II)  BC  patients  and  healthy controls,  4  of  which  were  further found  to  be  mutually  significant  in both  stage I/control  and  stage II/control comparisons.

Power analysis showedthat 50 samples in each group willprovide an excellent test.D.3 Aim 1: Validate the diagnosis performance of the panel of 6 plasma metabolites3 for early stage TNBC. D.3.1 Rationale: Our previous work has shown that certain blood metabolites are significantly different between BC and healthy controls and that it is possible to determine if a subject has early stage BC with high specificity and sensitivity2-3. As the samples for prior work mainly came from non-TNBC patients (although including a few TNBC patients), the motivation behind Aim 1 is to verify that the previous results will also hold for early stage TNBC patients.  D.3.2 Sample preparation: All preparation steps will follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs)  we  established  for  analyzing  human  biofluid  samples3,  69,  77-81.  Briefly,  for  aqueous extraction, 50 L of each plasma sample will be mixed with 500 L MeOH and 50 L internal standard  solution  (containing  1,810.5  M  13C3-lactate  and  142  M  13C5-glutamic  acid).  The mixture will then be vortexed for 10 s and stored at -20C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4C. The supernatants (450 L) will be dried and then reconstituted in 150 L of 40% phosphate-buffered saline/60% acetonitrile (ACN). A pooled sample, 50 L taken  from  all  plasma  samples,  will  be  used  as  the  quality  control  (QC)  sample  and  injected once every 10 experimental samples to monitor system performance.  D.3.3 Targeted LC-MS/MS detection of the plasma panel of 6 metabolites3, using both the Training  Set  and  Validation  Set  samples:  These  significant  metabolites  (Table  1)  will  be ported  to  our  highly  reproducible  and  sensitive  targeted  LC-MS/MS  platform.  We  are  highly experienced with targeted LC-MS/MS detection65, 67, 69-74, 82-83; for example, our pathway-specific targeted  method  was  developed  based  on  HILIC  (hydrophilic  interaction  chromatography)  for the detection of over 300 metabolites from >35 different metabolic pathways of strong biological significance.  In  this  study,  all  LC-MS/MS  experiments  will  be  performed  on  an  Agilent  1290 UPLC-6490  QQQ-MS  system.  We  will  optimize  the  LC-MS/MS  system  using  metabolite standards, and important parameters mainly include precursor ion, product ion, collision voltage, and retention times (RTs). For study samples, targeted data acquisition will be performed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode, due to significant advantages of great selectivity and excellent quantitation. Samples will be run with a set of internal or external standards such that we can determine absolute concentrations of the selected metabolites.  BRANDER BEACONS CANCER RESEARCH | branderbeacons.com | info@branderbeacons.com9D.3.4 Discovery statistical analyses using the Training Set samples: For each metabolite, we will use multivariate logistic regression to determine the statistical significance of intensity differences  in  binary  comparisons  across  different  groups,  considering  age,  BMI,  and  other clinical factors as covariates. The false discovery rate (FDR) of these multiple hypothesis tests will  be  controlled  using  the  method  proposed  by  Storey  and  Tibshirani84,  with  a  significance threshold of q < 0.05. Initial selection of significant metabolites will focus attention on those with low  q-values  and  high  fold  changes.  We  will  further  employ  a  regularized  regression  model, namely  Lasso,  to  select  an  optimal  set  of  biomarkers  to  achieve  the  highest  combined discriminative power. With this panel of biomarkers, we will build a logistic regressio",

Ms. Nyarige is currently working on developing several bioinformatics tools that can help understand different disease etiology. For example, she is actively working on a project that focuses on patients with neuro-degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) where she is using genetic data like whole genome sequence, to develop computational methodologies to help understand the mechanisms of these diseases. Her other research focus has been on cancer - specifically brain cancer where she plans to generalize these methodologies to help understand diseases like Glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer), as well as predict patients at risk of developing these diseases. The fact that these projects can be generalized to most disease make translation of her research easy. Her research is very important as it plays a key role in aiding early disease detection and further contributes to more informed treatment plans, moving us a step closer to precision medicine. With the findings from Ms. Nyarige s work, we can quickly identify patients at risk and put them on close monitoring as required. ",

FP00021104,117,,,,,1,,,"Attachment 3: Technical Abstract  Background:  A recent paper by our team analyzed metabolite concentrations of the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) and trans-sulfuration (TS) pathways in blood samples of 83 children with ASD and 76 age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) peers ages 3-10 years.  Several other studies have also previously demonstrated consistent abnormalities in these pathways, including primarily increased oxidative stress, decreased methylation, and decreased glutathione.  Notably, our advanced statistical analysis of the metabolites with Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) enabled the development of a diagnostic model which had 98% sensitivity and 96% specificity, after leave-one-out cross-validation.  In addition to known impairments in the FOCM/TS pathways and sulfate metabolism, our group has also searched for abnormalities in other metabolic pathways.  We analyzed hundreds of metabolites in blood from 31 children with ASD and 28 TD children.  We found that the 5MetPath model, a subset of five key metabolites (glutamate, methylmalonic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, and levulinic acid), had very good ability to differentiate ASD from TD, with sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 87% after cross-validation.  These five metabolites play important roles in five metabolic pathways (glutamate synthesis/degradation, folate/B12 metabolism, benzoate degradation, lysine/saccharopine metabolism, and gamma-keto acids).  Abnormalities in each of these five metabolites are indicative of different metabolic pathway impairments.  So, although there is some overlap with the FOCM/TS metabolites, these five metabolites also represent several additional areas of metabolic abnormalities, and thus represent a more complete picture of important metabolic abnormalities in autism. FY19 ARP Clinical Translational Research Award Area(s) of Interest:  Improve diagnosis and access to services across the life span Hypothesis:  Most cases of autism can be identified by measurement of several key metabolites. Specific Aim 1:  Validate the original FOCM/TS model in another cohort.  We will collect blood and urine samples from a new cohort of 100 children with ASD and 100 TD children, ages 2-12 years and of similar gender.  We will measure the FOCM/TS metabolites in those children, and using our original model we will predict which of those children have ASD or are TD.  This will provide formal and rigorous validation of the original FOCM/TS model, along with its sensitivity and specificity. Specific Aim 2:  Improve the FOCM/TS model and validate it.  We will also measure sulfate metabolism and the 5 metabolites of the 5MetPath model in the 100 children with ASD and the 100 TD children, and search for new metabolic biomarkers to improve the model.  We will use 60 children in each group to develop an improved diagnostic test that combines key biomarkers of the FOCM/TS, sulfate, and 5-MetPath tests.  We will then validate that model by determining its sensitivity and specificity in the remaining 40 children in each group who are not part of the development of the model. Study Design:  We will conduct a case-control study to measure the levels of specific metabolites in 100 children with ASD ages 2-12 years, and 100 TD children of similar age and gender.  We will use those results to validate the original FOCM/TS model, and then develop and validate an improved version of it. Impact:  This research will result in the first validated medical test for ASD, allowing more accurate and potentially earlier diagnosis and hence earlier intervention, which should greatly improve the childs outcome.  Also, the results of the metabolite measurements will suggest methods for personalized treatment for First effort to fully validate the FOCM/TS model. The FOCM/TS model is the most promising medical each child based on their individual biochemistry.  It will also suggest future targets for research and treatment. Innovation:  This project involves several significant innovations: 1) test for diagnostic screening for ASD, and the proposed validation study will confirm that.  2) have shown to be very abnormal in children with ASD.   3) understanding of possible mechanisms and enable future targeted treatment studies.  First effort to improve the FOCM/TS model by incorporating several other metabolic pathways that we Greatly improve our understanding of metabolic abnormalities in ASD, which will enhance ",
FP00021180,118,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY   Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) disparities among Latino children and adolescents represent some of the most significant public health challenges facing society. Inflammation is associated with beta-cell dysfunction and both are evident in obese youth with prediabetes. Lifestyle intervention is the primary approach to preventing or delaying onset of T2D and has been effective in improving the inflammatory milieu and beta-cell function. However, less is known about the effect of lifestyle intervention on specific pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators associated with beta-cell dysfunction in youth. Furthermore, the relationship between changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and changes in beta-cell function remains unexplored in obese youth. Knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which T2D risk mediators are improved is limited due to a lack of measurement of different anti-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, we propose a longitudinal study that will examine the effect of lifestyle intervention on pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in 26 obese Latino youth with prediabetes as compared to a usual care control group of 26 obesity- and glycemia-matched Latino youth. Understanding how changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory markers relate to changes in beta-cell function is important to identify specific mechanisms that can be targeted in future studies. Therefore, this study will explore the association between changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and changes in beta-cell function in obese Latino youth with prediabetes.  This proposal leverages the resources and infrastructure of an ongoing diabetes prevention study and builds upon a transdisciplinary team of mentors to address a critical gap in chronic disease prevention in obese Latino youth, age 12-16 years. This innovative approach is an essential first step in the development of lifestyle interventions aimed at targeting inflammatory mechanisms to assess changes in T2D risk in this high-risk population.

FP00021243,123,,,,,1,,,"To capitalize on the promise of precision medicine, clinical decision making will increasingly depend on validated, high-quality biomarkers that can be used to guide surveillance and treatment. Markers of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) will be particularly important, since TNBC continues to be a severe threat to womens health worldwide. However, clinically useful biomarkers predictive of occurrence or survival for TNBC patients are lacking.In this project, we hypothesize that the onset and progression of TNBC is detectable in blood, through the measurement of changes in metabolic profiles. We will use state-of-the-art metabolomics profiling methods and a well-characterized biorepository, and this collaborative study seeks to identify and validate plasma metabolite markers associated with early stage TNBC. Specifically, we will 1) examine and validate the panel of 6 plasma metabolites discovered in our previous study for BC diagnosis, for detecting early stage TNBC, and 2) develop and validate a new diagnostic test for early stage TNBC, through examining the significantly expanded metabolome that includes >2,500 aqueous metabolites and lipids. Our discovery of metabolic biomarkers will yield novel, distinct signals related to early stage TNBC, and will also be synergistic with ongoing analyses of the proteome, glycome, and autoantibodies in this patient population. The long-term goal will be to develop clinical-grade biomarker assays with significant impact on reducing morbidity and mortality associated with TNBC.",
FP00021251,124,,,,,1,,,"SPECIFIC AIMS Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half of heart failure (HF) cases, and is more common in women than men. Compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) for which there are numerous proven pharmacologic therapies, there are no evidence-based effective therapies for HFpEF. This is driven in no small part by the marked heterogeneity of the syndrome combining multiple co-morbidities, to our poor understanding of the  net  underlying  pathways  involved.  Common  features  of  HFpEF  include  hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome/obesity.  These have been linked to pro-inflammatory pathways, resulting in reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and deficient cGMP/protein kinase G signaling. The net effect is worsening of cardio-metabolic, renal, and other organ dysfunction to generate the syndrome.  The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Go Red  For  Women  (GRFW)-Network  Center  tests  the  hypothesis  that  this  pathophysiology  is significantly  worse  in  post-menopausal  women  due  to  a  decline  in  estrogen-dependent  NO signaling.    In  the  JHU  Center  project,  targeted  molecular  signaling  and  gene  transcriptome analyses are being performed, focusing on heart and skeletal muscle.   In  this  Soter  Collaboration  project,  we  will  expand  our  investigation  to  include  metabolomics, teaming up with Dr. Sears from the UC San Diego GRFW-Network Center (now based at Arizona State University College of Health Solutions) who is doing similar analyses in her  Basic  Science  Project  and  our  metabolomics  collaborators  at  the  University  of Pennsylvania. This will be very useful for a syndrome with prominent co-morbidities including obesity,  metabolic  disease,  and  hypertension.    Their  analysis  provides  quantitative  data  for over  300  metabolites,  providing  a  snapshot  of  essential  nutrient  and  energy  pathways  and associated signaling. Relevant pathways include lipid oxidation and branched chain amino acid catabolism,  and  levels  of  intermediate  metabolites  (e.g.,  acylcarnitines  and  alpha-ketoacid BCAA derivatives) are assessed by targeted metabolomic analysis of mitochondrial metabolite biomarkers. Metabolomics data will be collected not only from the same select tissue muscle samples we are obtaining, but also from plasma. The proposed work vastly expands on recent plasma-only  metabolomics  HFpEF  studies  as  it  assesses  blood  and  tissue  from  the  same patient  for  the  first  time,  is  the  first  to  combine  transcriptome/metabolome  analysis  with extensive  clinical  phenotyping,  and  will  specifically  address  the  contributions  of  sex  and estrogen  status  to  these  biological/clinical  signatures.    The  Bader  laboratory  at  JHU  will perform  the  bioinformatic  analysis  combining  these  various  data  sets  using  a  multi-scale, systems biology integration approach.   Aim 1: Determine the metabolomic profile from plasma from 100 HFpEF patients (60 women, 40 men)  enrolled  in  the  JHU/NU  HFpEF  deep phenotyping  study  and  compare by  sex,  and additionally compare to 40 age and sex matched non-HFpEF subjects enrolled at NU as part of  the  phenotyping  study.  This  will  be  accomplished  by  measuring  concentrations  of  ~300 plasma metabolites (e.g., amino acids, acylcarnitines, organic acids) at baseline in the HFpEF cohort  in  collaboration  with  USCD.    Hypothesis:  Key  clinical  features  of  HFpEF  including exercise capacity, echocardiographic data of cardiac structure and function, vascular function, demographic  covariates  such  as  age,  obesity/DM,  research  site, female  sex,  and metabolic/molecular  parameters  such  as  estrogen  cGMP/PKG  regulatory  function    will  be systematically  linked  to  metabolomic  subgroup  clusters,  providing  a  biomarker  for  patient diagnosis and therapy targeting.   Aim  2:  To  obtain  metabolomics  profiling  in  the  subset  of  HFpEF  patients  (30  patients  with skeletal muscle biopsy; 30 patients with endomyocardial biopsy and 30 non-failing controls) to  1   determine tissue-specific metabolic and mitochondrial profiling, and link this with concomitant RNAseq data and targeted cGMP/PKG molecular signaling. Hypothesis: Metabolomics from muscle tissue in HFpEF (specifically mitochondrial related signaling) will correlate with plasma metabolomics  as  markers  of  exertional  disability  and  defects  associated  with  metabolic syndrome.    We  further  anticipate  metabolic  profiles  will  form  phenotype  clusters  that  are sex/estrogen  status  dependent  and  correlate  with  tissue-based  analysis  of  cGMP/PKG signaling and the transcriptome.     2  Statement of Work:  This project is part of a multi-site collaboration between Subcontract PI Dr. Dorothy Sears, Dr. Matthew Allison (Site PI at UCSD) and Dr. Kavita Sharma (Site PI at the Johns Hopkins University (JHU)) and Dr. Sharmas team which include investigators at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and Northwestern University (NU). The project is funded by a Soter Collaborative Award that is part of the American Heart Association Go Red for Women  Strategically  Focused  Research  Network.  Heart  failure  with  preserved  ejection  fraction  (HFpEF) constitutes  half  of  heart  failure  cases  today,  is  more  common  in  women  than  men,  and  is  associated  with numerous  comorbidities  including  hypertension,  diabetes,  and  obesity.  There  are  no  specific  therapies  for HFpEF  with  proven  survival  benefit.  The  overall  aim  of  this  Soter  project  is  to  investigate  metabolomic aberrancies  in  skeletal  and  endomycardial  tissue  and  plasma  from  HFpEF  patients  to  better  understand underlying mechanisms of disease.

FP00021290,125,,,,,1,,,"Background: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) affect a large number of individuals in the U.S., with athletes and Military Service Members at particularly high risk. A challenge in the understanding of the longer-term sequelae of TBI is that the TBI population is notoriously heterogeneous. This heterogeneity partly arises from the presence of concomitant conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and disturbed sleep. Due to the context of many injuries, Veterans are more susceptible to these comorbid conditions. Demographic variables, including gender, ethnicity, and bilingual status, are also likely contributors to the variability in TBI profiles, but there is little research on such effects. Given the rising number of military Veterans experiencing TBI and the growing proportion of Hispanics and bilinguals in the U.S. enlisted forces and the general population, research on these effects will have implications for both service members and civilians.Objective: The proposed study will utilize data from the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR) to examine how concomitant conditions relate to the cognitive and neuropsychological sequelae of TBI in civilians and military Service Members, with a focus on demographic subgroups. The overall goal is to establish the identification of unique clinical outcomes for civilians and Service Members.Specific Aims: 1) To compare civilians and military Service Members in the prevalence of conditions concomitant with TBI and evaluate group differences in the relationships between those conditions and neuropsychological/cognitive profiles; 2) To identify profiles of specific demographic subgroups (Hispanics, bilinguals) in their prevalence of TBI, concomitant conditions, and cognitive/neuropsychological symptoms; 3) To develop evidence-based clinical guidelines for military Veterans and specific demographic subgroup populations based on the study findings.Retrospective Study Design: Common data elements (CDEs) across studies were identified to allow for cross-study examination of specific measures of cognitive performance and neuropsychological symptoms. When appropriate, responses will be re-scored to allow for analysis of measures across studies. Demographic characteristics, TBI symptoms, concomitant conditions (sleep disorders, depression, PTSD), and cognitive performance (e.g., inhibition, verbal learning, mental flexibility, and executive function) will be examined. Group differences will be assessed for veteran group status (civilian vs. military), gender (male vs female), ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic), and bilingual status (bilingual vs monolingual). Multiple regression models will be used to examine the predictive relationship of demographic factors on reported symptoms and cognitive performance after adjusting for potentially confounding factors. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to test for group differences in cognitive performance.Impact: The proposed study examines how specific demographic factors relate to TBI-associated symptoms. The findings will inform the development of clinical guidelines specifically for military populations and for under-researched populations, including female veterans, Hispanics, and bilinguals. Currently, almost no research exists on outcomes for Hispanics and bilinguals with mTBI, thus making the proposed analyses relevant to both military and civilian populations. Determining the impact of demographic factors on TBI outcomes, and incorporating the findings into revised clinical guidelines, will allow clinicians to tailor their treatment approaches based on the specific characteristics of the patient.",
FP00021314,126,,,,,1,,,"Delivery of actionable nutrition information to the public remains a vital approach to preventing and treating the deleterious and expensive chronic diseases and conditions that originate in part from lifestyle-related behaviors.   Because medical and health professionals have access to, and the trust of, large groups of individuals through their practices, they represent a key touchpoint for delivery of fundamental, evidence-based nutrition education. And, because they often see the same individuals with at least some frequency over time, they have the opportunity to build on education and provide continued motivation on individuals path to improved diet and health.  However, very little nutrition education is provided in medical school or other professional training settings, in part because of the great volume of other content that must be delivered and also because nutrition is generally not highlighted in testing. This gap in nutrition education can be addressed by the development of freely available nutrition modules with scalable content related to diet and health outcomes. Further, given trends in information delivery online, such content could be delivered in novel ways that provide physicians, nurses, and medical and allied health students a variety of avenues for learning, including high-quality videos, narrative-style podcasts, and interactive tools that support multiple types of learners.  The proposed project represents a novel collaboration between a national healthcare leader in HonorHealth and the global leader in innovative online educational content delivery, Arizona State University (ASU). The objective of this proposed project is to create a new set of multimedia nutrition- and diet-education modules representing the latest research in the field that can be delivered freely online to a large network of medical and health professionals. The modules will focus on evidence-based nutrition principles coupled with lessons learned from cutting-edge research in four areas:   nutrition fundamentals, dietary supplements, popular diets for weight management, and pathways to better diets and better health.  These modules will be linked to educational enhancement so that health professionals can, if desired, easily identify onramps to more in-depth information through credentialing programs, such as certificate and degree programs.  The modules will utilize the Canvas platform thus allowing for quantifying the use and efficacy this educational program.  ASU, separate from this proposed project, is designing a medical nutrition certificate program, which can be launched to coincide with the launch of this educational content. As such, it will provide the next step in nutrition education for medical and health professionals. Further, ASU already offers a fully online, one-year professional masters program in Medical Nutrition, which provides yet another level of in-depth education on nutrition information for the medical setting.",
FP00021333,127,,,,,1,,,"One in three Arizona children are recipients of our state Medicaid program, Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS). The children receive coverage for dental services through AHCCCS, pediatric usage rates remains low, with fewer than half regularly visiting a dentist. This is of particular concern for low-income and vulnerable children who are often navigating a variety of social determinants of health and access to care issues. Lack of regular and preventative dental health services puts children at significantly higher risk for serious dental illness such as tooth decay and dental caries, all of which can have dangerous health implications and wide ranging social and economic impact. Tooth decay is the leading cause of missed school days among all children in Arizona and a 3rd graders in our state living in poverty is almost twice as likely to suffer from tooth decay compared to their higher resourced counterparts.

Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery, Center for Sleep Medicine]; Dana Epstein, PhD, RN [ASU, College of Health Solutions]; Erik St. Louis, MD, MS [Mayo Clinic Rochester, Center for Sleep Medicine] Stroke survivors are four-to-six times more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) than the general population. Clinical trials indicate that the gold standard treatment for OSA, positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, is feasible in this population, and is associated with improvements in function and motor outcomes, sleepiness, depressive symptoms, neurological recovery, and reduced mortality. Yet, adherence to PAP therapy is substantially lower among stroke survivors with OSA compared to OSA patients without stroke. Specialty care and intensive programs for patients with comorbid acute stroke and OSA are rare and costly. A self-management approach to long-term care is needed. We seek to leverage an existing smartphone application, called SleepWell24, designed to promote adherence to PAP therapy among patients with OSA. Our team developed and recently completed testing of SleepWell24 within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the Mayo Clinic Centers for Sleep Medicine (CSM) at Arizona and Rochester with NIH/NINR R21NR016046 support [NCT03156283]. In this proposed usability and clinical feasibility project, we will expand and adapt its capabilities to impact clinical practice among stroke survivors with OSA prior to future testing in a large RCT. Our patient-facing, smartphone application, SleepWell24, currently targets PAP therapy adherence through objective feedback from biosensors (i.e., Fitbit activity/sleep tracker, PAP machine) and evidence-based lifestyle behavior change components (sleep, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and nutrition) among newly diagnosed OSA patients without recent stroke. We propose to: (Aim 1) expand and adapt SleepWell24 to accommodate stroke patient needs and to include patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) of physical function, general cognition, depression symptoms, and fatigue; (Aim 2) pilot test adapted-SleepWell24  implementation in 20 PAP-nave stroke survivors with OSA in a feasibility, pre-post single arm design; and (Aim 3) produce and input summarizations of provider stakeholder-selected SleepWell24 data into Aim 2 patients Epic electronic health records (EHR) to investigate impact on patient-provider communication and treatment decision-making. For Aims 1 and 3, we will use a user-centered iterative design process to obtain stroke patient (n=5) and interdisciplinary provider team (n=3; CSM, stroke, primary care) feedback on incorporation of PROMs and adaptations specific to stroke survivors into SleepWell24. In Aim 3, these same provider teams will be simultaneously engaged to inform the selection and visual display of clinically-meaningful data captured from SleepWell24 to be summarized and scanned into Epic EHR. The Mobile App Programming (MAP) Core in ASUs College of Health Solutions (CHS), the same team that developed and manages SleepWell24, will use this feedback to program the PROMs and tailor SleepWell24 accordingly. In Aim 2, we will test preliminary clinical feasibility of the working prototype over the first 60 days of PAP use. To complete Aim 3, post-treatment, we will re-engage the provider stakeholder teams to provide feedback on the impact of SleepWell24 data entered into Aim 2 patients EHR on patient-provider communication and treatment decision-making. These activities expand SleepWell24 to a vulnerable, aged population at greatest risk for non-adherence to PAP therapy and related neurological sequelae and disability. With the addition of PROMs and implementation of SleepWell24 data into OSA-stroke care delivery processes, we will strengthen our intervention approach (via enhanced patient-provider communication and quality care) and expand applicability of SleepWell24 to a complex population; thus positioning ourselves to apply for larger funding opportunities (R01), and improve SleepWell24s clinical practice integration.

FP00021381,129,,,,,1,,,"ABSTRACT:  This pilot study has two Specific Aims: Aim-1 to identify modifiable risk factors contributing to the persistent racial disparity of gallbladder cancer (GbCa) incidence, and Aim-2 to characterize a prominent risk factor for GbCa, namely, gallstone disease. The overarching goal of the two interrelated aims is to lay a foundation for developing effective strategies in early diagnosis and timely treatment of GbCa in high-risk populations. Gallbladder cancer presents one of the greatest racial disparities of cancer burden in the U.S., with American Indian (AI) people at a 6-fold or higher incidence rate than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). This disparity has been known for half a century, especially in Alaska and the Southwest Region of the U.S.; based on our recent systematic literature review and meta-analysis, however, no significant progress in reducing this disparity has been reported. Major risk factors have been recognized including a history of cholelithiasis (formation of gallstones) and type II diabetes (DM-II); being AI, female, obese or overweight; and a family history of GbCa and cholelithiasis. Noticeably, several of these risk factors are modifiable through medical and behavioral interventions. Aim-1 will identify the top three modifiable factors that contribute to the persistent racial disparity of GbCa incidence. We will focus on Mayo Clinics catchment area population in Arizona, i.e., Maricopa County, using 225 de-identified GbCa patients (45 AIs and 180 NHWs 1:4 matched on age and sex). Our primary objective is to identify the actionable targets in reducing GbCa burden among high-risk individuals. Gallstones, where stones are formed in the gallbladder, liver or bile duct, occur in up to 80% of GbCa patients and particularly in older women of AI and Hispanic origin, and cholelithiasis is a common medical condition in U.S. adults. Besides the morbidity and mortality associated with cholelithiasis itself, the excessive risk of digestive system cancers in gallstone carriers is remarkable, specifically, 3-10 times higher risk of GbCa, 2-4 times of liver cancer, and 1.2-2 times of other digestive system cancers. Even among asymptomatic individuals harboring gallstones, an overall 50% increased risk of cancer was reported. Aim-2 will focus on gallstones utilizing the Mountain Park Biobank with patients clinical and epidemiologic questionnaire data resources in Phoenix Arizona, where we will assess plasma metabolome to identify metabolic markers in predicting gallstone phenotypes, and their associations with sex difference in cholelithiasis and GbCa risk.

The overarching goal of the two interrelated aims is to lay a foundation for developing effective strategies in early diagnosis and timely treatment of GbCa in high-risk populations. Gallbladder cancer presents one of the greatest racial disparities of cancer burden in the U.S., with American Indian (AI) people at a 6- fold or higher incidence rate than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). This disparity has been knownfor half a century, especially in Alaska and the Southwest Region of the U.S.; based on our recent systematic literature review and meta-analysis, however, no significant progress in reducing this disparity has been reported. Major risk factors have been recognized including a history of cholelithiasis (formation of gallstones) and type II diabetes (DM-II); being AI, female, obese or overweight; and a family history of GbCa and cholelithiasis. Noticeably, several of these risk factors are modifiable through medical and behavioral interventions. Aim-1 will identify the top three modifiable factors that contribute to the persistent racial disparity of GbCa incidence. We will focus on Mayo Clinics catchment area population in Arizona, i.e., Maricopa County, using 225 de-identified GbCa patients (45 AIs and 180 NHWs 1:4 matched on age andsex). Our primary objective is to identify the actionable targets in reducing GbCa burden among high-risk individuals. Gallstones, where stones are formed in the gallbladder, liver or bile duct, occur in up to 80% of GbCa patients and particularly in older women of AI and Hispanic origin, and cholelithiasis is a common medical condition in U.S. adults. Besides the morbidity and mortality associated with cholelithiasis itself, the excessive risk of digestive system cancers in gallstone carriers is remarkable, specifically, 3-10 times higher risk of GbCa, 2-4 times of livercancer, and 1.2-2 times of other digestive system cancers. Even among asymptomatic individuals harboring gallstones, an overall 50% increased risk of cancer was reported. Aim-2 will focus on gallstones utilizing the Mountain Park Biobank with patients clinical and epidemiologic questionnaire data resources in Phoenix Arizona, where we will assess plasma metabolome to identify metabolic markers in predicting gallstone phenotypes, and their associations with sex difference in cholelithiasis and GbCa risk.",

FP00021513,132,,,,,1,,,"My overarching research aim is to develop a multi-disciplinary program studying aging in older adults with ASD from basic science to translational treatment, factoring in the largely unexplored area of sex differences. Aging research in ASD is minimal, yet estimates suggests there will soon be over 4 million adults with ASD. My Autism and Brain Aging Laboratory is among the first to: 1) comprehensively describe age-relatedcognitive and brain changes in adults with ASD, and 2) develop behaviorally and neurobiologically informed interventions for aging adults with ASD. I have a rich multi-disciplinary foundation investigating cognitive aging, including molecular and behavioral neuroscience techniques. In my current research, I employ human neuroimaging (functional and structural MRI and EEG) and neuropsychology techniques, with collaborations in genomics. Through a K01 from the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH), I am undergoing rigorous training in advanced analytics. My combination of novel questions and research methods poises me to be a leader in the field of ASD aging research. Cognitive and brain aging with ASD. During my postdoc, I developed one of the first longitudinal cohorts of older men with ASD as Co-PI on a three-year, Department of Defense (DoD) grant. My colleagues and I published our initial findings in the top autism journal (Braden et al., 2017, Autism Research) and have now added three additional manuscripts to the first Special Issue: Growing Older with Autism in Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders. Establishing sex differences: I am PI on a three-year grant from the Arizona Biomedical Research Commission to extend our study to women and delineate sex differences in aging with ASD. Sexspecificpredictors of exacerbated aging: I am thrilled to be the PI on a recent four-year K01 Career Development Award from the NIMH. This award funds the continuation of our longitudinal aging cohort and my training in advanced analytics. The expected outcome is to identify the combination of brain and behavior measures that best predict age-related cognitive decline in older men and women with ASD. This award alsoprovides me programmatic training to establish an NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (P30) in Arizona. My PhD student was recently awarded an NIMH F31 to predict sex-specific core symptom aging outcomes from our longitudinal cohort. Genomic markers: As PI on a Virginia G. Piper Charitable Trust Award, Icollaborated with the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix, AZ to identify a genomic marker of cognitive function in ASD. The resulting manuscript is in review. I will submit an add-on to my K01 in 2020 to evaluate the same genomic marker in our aging cohort.Behavioral interventions for adults with ASD. Cognition and social communication. Building directly on findings from our longitudinal aging study, I am Co-PI on a DoD Clinical Translational Research Award that is under review. This neurobiologically informed intervention aims to address cognitive and social communicationdeficits we identified in aging adults with ASD. We will combine the widely effective social communication intervention for young-adults with ASD, PEERS, with the newly impactful HABIT intervention for older adults with cognitive decline. Depression and anxiety: Because of my background in the neurocircuitry of mood regulation and mindfulness-based interventions, it was striking when we noted elevated depression and anxiety symptoms in adults with ASD that may get worse with age. As a postdoc, I authored a grant awarded by the Institute for Mental Health Research to detail co-morbid mood symptoms in aging adults with ASD and inform our future clinical trial. I now lead the first clinical trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) foradults with ASD. We are confirming efficacy and identifying neural correlates of symptom improvement. Our first manuscript identifying a brain change that predicts depression reduction is in review. To develop entrepreneurial aspects of our mindfulness in ASD intervention research, I was PI on a National ScienceFoundation I-Corps Award to develop a mindfulness app tailored to adults with ASD. I am preparing an R01 to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) for this work to be submitted in 2019. My other PhD student has an NCCIH F31 for added analysis of neural predictors currently under review.SUMMARY: ASD is one of the most common developmental disorders and a lifelong condition.

FP00021519,133,,,,,1,,,"I.Background: Optimizing early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major public health priority that will impact hundreds of thousands of patients per year and will directly lead to changes in clinical practice and improved patient outcomes. The goal of this project is to improve the early detection of liver cancer in patients by: 1) using lottery-style health promoting prizes to increase HCC surveillance rates beyond those achieved by care coordination and action planning and; 2) by using microsimulation modeling to develop precision surveillance protocols that maximize the health benefits of HCC surveillance while minimizing its risk and economic cost.II.Specific Aims: The Specific Aims are to:Aim I: To conduct a randomized controlled trial testing the hypothesis that lottery-style health-promoting prizes reduce the time between HCC imaging tests. Subjects in Arm A (control) will be enrolled in PARTNER (Promoting AdheRence To Liver caNcEr SuRveillance) only. To reinforce PARTNER, subjects in Arm B will be given the opportunity to win prizes each time they complete an HCC imaging test. The primary outcome is the percentage of the group that undergoes imaging at 6 months, compared between the two Arms (n=110 per Arm). The secondary outcome is the comparison between Arm A (PARTNER only) and historical controls (no HCC care coordination). Tertiary endpoints include the percentage of time up-to-date with surveillance and self-reported barriers to surveillance.Aim II: To use computer modeling to identify key determinants of the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of alternative surveillance strategies.III.Services to be Performed: Co-I Chad Stecher will provide advice on the study design and implementation strategy for Aim I during the first year of this project, and will help perform the necessary statistical analyses and write-up of the findings generated by this research in year five. In addition, Dr. Stecher is expected to present to biostatistics design workshop (a weekly gathering of all core quantitative scientists for reviewing and approving investigator-initiated trials) design and analysis plan of any protocol arising from this liver spore involving behavioral economics-based research.",
FP00021543,134,,,,,1,,,"One of our toughest challenges is treating and caring for patients with severe impairment following a stroke. Severe stroke survivors have a grim prognosis because they do not meet eligibility criteria for our most effective therapeutic solutions. With 800,000 additional strokes occurring each year, there is a clear need for more effective therapy solutions for individuals across all levels of disability.  What if there was a non-invasive, easily implemented tool that allowed severe stroke survivors to participate in traditional therapy? Startle may provide a solution. Startle is elicited using a loud, acoustic stimulus which evokes the classic flinching reflex. However, when the same startling stimulus is applied in the presence of a motor plan, startle involuntarily evokes planned movements (e.g. reaching), a phenomenon referred to as StartReact. Distinct from the stereotyped flinching startle reflex, startReact movements unlock the execution of sophisticated muscle activity patterns and movements tightly regulated and scaled with the intended action. I have recently advanced startle (specifically startReact) as a therapeutic technique because of the profound way it affects movement in individuals with stroke, in particular severe stroke. I have shown that when the movements of severe stroke survivors with little to no voluntary movement (Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer < 25/66) are elicited via startle, muscle recruitment and reaching distances are increased on average 38% and 15%, respectively. This effect is immediate and requires no training. Importantly, this acute benefit generalizes to voluntarily initiated movement. Following training with startReact, subjects voluntarily initiated movement has increased muscle recruitment and reaching distance, and decreased proximity to target. Application of startle during hand extension training also increases the probability of muscle activation. These changes occur in a single session.   LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE: Develop startle as an adjuvant rehabilitation therapy to unlock preserved movement capacity of stroke survivors thereby allowing severe patients to participate in our most effective rehabilitation therapies. While the preliminary data are provocative, this proposal will address 4 key knowledge gaps so that Startle Rehabilitation Therapy (START) can be explored as a viable tool during therapy. IMPACT: If successful, this proposal will revolutionize the way we treat stroke survivors in 3 key ways. START 1) allows severe stroke survivors to participate in and benefit from therapy, 2) is inexpensive and mobile allowing it to be implemented in rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged hospitals, and 3) best suited to be used alongside traditional therapy (adjuvant) allowing its use across many modalities (i.e. arm, hand, speech).  INNOVATION: The PI runs the only lab in the world pursing START as a therapeutic target. This proposal is intrinsically high-risk because it represents a completely novel, untested paradigm but if successful has the potential to revolutionize the way we treat stroke survivors across all levels of disability.

FP00021554,135,,,,,1,,,"INTERPRET: INTEgRative approach to PREdictive biomarker development and Translation in HER2+ breast cancer  Abstract The goal of this US-Ireland R&D Partnership Programme is to discover, validate, integrate and translate a set of individual biomarker assays that will guide therapy of early stage HER2+ breast cancer (BC). HER2 is overexpressed in ~20% of BC. There are a number of approved HER2-targeted therapies, administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Since as many as half of patients fail to respond to first line HER2-based therapy, novel biomarkers are needed to stratify treatment. Many factors have been investigated individually to predict therapy response; however, none can be reliably used clinically. We will take a systems approach by characterizing descriptive and functional biomarkers. Both innate and adaptive cellular and humoral immune response are associated with anti-tumor immunity. We will perform a patented immune function assay using antibody dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to assess patients innate immune competence in the presence of anti-Her2+ antibody. We will adapt and assess a novel prognostic 63-gene phospho-HER2-based tumor gene expression signature developed through integration of Reverse-Phase Protein Array data with gene expression profiles in fresh-frozen (FF) HER2+ pan-cancer cohort samples. This signature will be developed for use with clinically-relevant Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) samples. Furthermore, molecular subtyping using RNA-seq data will facilitate the discovery of novel gene signatures associated with the different biological pathways underpinning various response states to first-line therapies. There is growing evidence for a functional role of tumor-associated autoantibodies (AAb) including ADCC. We will identify AAb biomarkers on the innovative Nucleic Acid-Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA) platform displaying the full human proteome. We propose a systems-level data integration and analysis strategy combining RNA-seq, function assay, TIL, chemokines, and AAb data generated from tissue, blood and cells isolated from the same Her2+ BC patient. We hypothesize that multi-parameter cellular, transcriptomic, genomic and immunologic data integration of the same Her2+ BC patient undergoing neoadjuvant treatment will reveal distinct signatures for patient stratification into responders and non-responders. We have assembled a renowned, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources from the Biodesign Center for Personalized Diagnostics (Arizona State University, US), Cancer Biotherapeutics (Dublin City University, Republic of Ireland) and Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (Queens University of Belfast, Northern Ireland). The project fulfills the requirements of the US-Ireland R&D Partnership Programme by increasing the level of collaborative R&D amongst researchers across the three nations in an area focused on the development of novel biomarkers for improving clinical management of Her2+ BC patients. Funding for the proposed work in Dublin and Belfast will come from the Republic of Ireland (Science Foundation Ireland) and Northern Ireland (R&D Office), respectively. NIH funding is requested for the US component.    ",

Presurgical mapping with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has developed into a standard tool to permit neurosurgeons to adjust surgical plans to spare language, motor, and other critical functions. Demand from both patients and surgeons exists to extend presurgical fMRI procedures to map other areas of cognitive function with high personal value. This pilot project develops procedures to localize cortical networks critical for music cognition in highly trained musicians. Preserving musical abilities would protect both life satisfaction and financial outcomes in professional musicians. We hypothesize that cortical networks critical for music cognition may be localized at an individual level, and that there is approximate consistency in the location of these cortical sites across people, a concept similar to that observed for language functions. To identify such regions, we have developed a novel experimental paradigm that has participants listen to music (versus non-musical control sounds) and perform music (versus a similarly complicated motor task) while undergoing functional brain scanning. Our research team includes experts from ASU in neuroimaging, music perception, and music performance and from Mayo in presurgical mapping, neuroradiology and neurosurgery. We have access to state-of-the-art MR-compatible noise cancelling headphones and will acquire an MR-compatible piano keyboard to perform the study. We expect our results to impact both basic science research on brain organization of music processing and to have translational implications for surgical planning. Our novel approach toward mapping will provide a template for other areas of expertise.  As such, we expect to use results from our pilot project to motivate both an NSF and a NIH grant.",

FP00021603,139,,,,,1,,,"The last decade saw considerable growth in the food service sector (FSS) with the global rise of eating out and emergence of food delivery apps. Projected growth in this sector will intensify resource use and environmental impact in terms of energy, water, solid waste, and air pollution. Urban regions are particularly important to consider given the concentration of food service operations there. Although strong local regulations can tackle some of the associated sustainability challenges, no global standard yet exists. Jurisdictions with lax or non-existent mandatory regulationson FSS thus have an opportunity to promote voluntary sustainability programmes developed and administered in collaboration with FSS stakeholders. The FSS in Hong Kong (HK) represents an important case study. The HK FSS remains largely unregulated. Government data shows restaurants consume most of the energy and water allocated to the commercial sector, contributing considerably to greenhouse gas emissions. Air quality studies further reveal cooking fumes from restaurants contribute greater particulate matter (PM) pollution than private vehicles in the area. Additionally, food waste constitutes nearly 40% of all municipal solid waste in HK, eventually contributing to methane emissions from already overflowing landfills. As such, clear operational controls in kitchens are needed for limiting energy and water consumption along with controlling and treating waste from oversized portions and over-ordering. Globally, the problems of resource consumption, air quality and production of waste relating to food provision are significant. To a considerable extent, these issues are embedded in FSS due to a lack of consistent operational control of equipment, regular maintenance, use of resource-efficient equipment, food production and waste diversion systems, and design of retail spaces. The absence of any programme based on the Food Waste-Energy-Water- Emissions (FEWE) nexus to systematically evaluate and drive sustainability practices in commercial kitchens means these issues remain unchecked.",

FP00021675,142,,,,,1,,,"Falls in older adults lead to enormous personal, economic, and societal costs, and current treatments are largely ineffective. For example, medications do not positively impact balance or reduce falls. In fact, polypharmacy is a risk factor for increased falls. Further, while physical rehabilitation programs have been developed to reduce falls, these approaches also have limited effectiveness. This reflects an urgent need for novel and innovative approaches to reduce and understand falls. It is on these topics that I have focused my career thus far. Specifically, I have developed both translational and basic/fundamental arms of my lab to 1) develop novel methods to reduce falls, and 2) understanding the link between the brain and domains of balance related to falls. This work has been focused primarily on individuals with neurological populations such as people with Parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis.A challenge in fall prevention research is the enormous number of ways that a person can lose their balance. For example, tripping, weight shifting, and transferring (e.g. moving from a chair to a toilet) are just a few of the many circumstances that can perturb balance and lead to a fall. However, regardless of the loss-of-balance circumstance, the ability to produce a quick and effective step (i.e. reactive balance) can often forestall the impending fall. This final common pathway for fall prevention is therefore a unique target for balance training. Over the past 7 years, my research has focused on understanding reactive balance, including the ways in which reactive balance is impacted by neurological conditions and what types of physical rehabilitation may improve these movements. Early work from our lab has provided promising results, suggesting that reactive balance is responsive to specific types of physical rehabilitation. We are following up on these findings with two externally funded clinical trials to understand how larger doses of training can improve stepping and reduce falls in neurological populations.In addition to exploring these translational questions, our lab is interested in clarifying more fundamental neuroscientific questions related to reactive balance, such as understanding the brain regions that contribute to these movements. We have begun to explore this this question through the use of functional MRI (e.g. Peterson et al. 2016 & 2017). This preliminary work suggests that, indeed, supraspinal structures likely contribute to speed and adaptability of reactive balance. However, additional work is necessary. Further, recently established collaborations here at Arizona State University in the College of Health Solutions provide additional avenues of assessment, including electro-encephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Through the use of these multi-modal neural recording and neural-modulation tools, the goal of my lab in the upcoming years is to provide clarity to fundamental neuroscientific questions surrounding reactive balance. Specifically, we will measure EEG during reactive stepping to characterize brain activity related to these movements, as well as functional MRI at rest to relate stepping performance (and EEG) to both structural and functional connectivity of the brain. Assessing brain and behavior in both neurotypical and neurological populations will provide important and actionable insights into the neural control of this critical movement.In short, while we are beginning to pursue early-stage rehabilitative trials to track the efficacy of reactive stepping training, a more thorough understanding of the brain regions contributing to these movements will enhance our ability to develop and test fall-prevention treatments. This work will also expand our basic understanding of how the brain controls these unique and functionally relevant movements. My expertise in reactive postural control, neural control of movement, and neurorehabilitation, as well as our preliminary work characterizing the relationship between brain connectivity and postural control place me in a unique position to carry out this important work. Further, my experience and commitment to leveraging basic science findings to treatments will facilitate an efficient translation of this knowledge toward improving treatments for people at risk for falls. The Sloan Foundation Fellowship will provide funds for protected time, small equipment, and staff support to facilitate continued growth in this critical and impactful area of research.",
FP00021683,143,,,,,1,,,"August 28, 2019  STATEMENT OF WORK   I. Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a crippling illness that affects 16% of US adults, costs over $37B annually, and results in high rates of hospitalization, readmission, and mortality. Self-management, particularly chronic medication use, is critical for improving health outcomes and slowing disease progression, but medication adherence among COPD patients is far too low, averaging about 40%. Wellth is a digital health company focused on promoting medication adherence among patients with chronic illnesses using a mobile health app that incorporates evidence-based strategies from behavioral economics (BE). To date, Wellth has successfully helped motivate patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension to achieve higher rates of medication adherence by providing financial incentives framed as losses with contextual reminders that serve as additional behavioral nudges. This tool has led to lower rates of hospitalization and reduced A1c among diabetes patients, but the long-term effectiveness of the Wellth app, along with many other BE-based interventions, needs to be further evaluated. Through this STTR, we propose to incorporate new behavior change strategies built on a well-established literature in psychology that identifies the powerful role that environmental cues play in successful habit formation and persistent behavioral change. Specifically, the app will offer financial incentives conditional on pairing a daily medication regimen with an already routinized behavior, such as brushing ones teeth or eating breakfast, a strategy called piggybacking, which has been successful at maintaining behavioral change among participants with high levels of motivation. By combining piggybacking with BE-based financial incentives, this new tool offers the potential for significant long-term improvements to COPD patients medication adherence. To test this strategy, the intervention will be implemented for COPD patients in the Mount Sinai Health System, an existing customer of Wellth.   Specific Aims: SA 1. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the new Wellth COPD program through patient and provider surveys that elicit reactions and preferences to the intervention design. SA 2. Compare changes in COPD medication adherence after a 30-day incentivization period between patients receiving the Wellth App and the Wellth App + pairing medication-taking with existing daily behaviors.  SA 3. Investigate the persistence of medication adherence improvements over the subsequent 30 days after incentivization.  Services to be Performed: PI Chad Stecher will assist with all stages of this proposed research. This includes the design and construction of the survey instruments, the intervention training materials, and the administration of survey assessments and the analysis of all study data.

The new method use over 7,000 features derived from an ensemble of genomic studies.    The new method will be compared to six other methods using four benchmark datasets.   Aim 2 is seen as the clear advance here and is well written. The new method will be applied  to  DAVs  in  type  2  diabetes.  A  large  number  (>40,000)  of  samples  will  be analyzed. The valid cases are identified from EHRs.   Software will be developed in python. Weaknesses:   Validation needs to expand beyond statistical replication.   The sample sizes of under-represented populations (~3000 Africans and ~5000 Mexican Americans) are not large given the context of the problem.   With respect to the diabetes data, it is not clear that the new method will discover DAVs missed by other methods or identify false positives.  Environment:  Strengths:  Weaknesses:    None.   The environment at Arizona State University is excellent.  Plans to strengthen the research proposal:  Based on the comments from the review panel and the program officer, I summarized three key issues in the previous proposal. I have investigated solutions to these issues and plan to strengthen the proposal with further research.  1.  Demonstrate scientific contributions of the new method that significantly advance the field In the January 2019 issue of the Nature Communications, my collaborators and I published a pivotal study showing functional noncoding DAVs with tissue specificities and clustering patterns  are  pervasive  in  the  human  genome  but  extremely  challenging  to  discover  with current methods. This is a significant knowledge gap that can be addressed by our new method potentially. To demonstrate the feasibility, I plan to conduct two experiments. E1a. Test if modeling gene-epigenetic interactions enables tissue-specific discoveries. We will build a pilot deep-learning model that has two phases. Phase-I uses genetic and epigenetic contexts of a noncoding variant to predict its regulatory roles in adipose tissues and in brain tissues jointly. Phase-II combines this information with other annotations to predict if a variant is relevant to diabetes or to Alzheimers disease. We expect that this model shows a higher accuracy than existing methods. E1b. Test if the above model can discriminate a functional DAV linked to a cluster of non-functional variants. Exact mapping of functional noncoding DAVs is available for several genomic loci. We will review these studies and curate annotations of allelic pathogenicity at each position. We will evaluate our pilot model on the precision of fine-mapping functional DAVs and compare with existing methods.   2.  Clinical significance of the identified DAVs and their validations. To broaden the translational spectrum, I will involve a physician scientist on diabetes genetics in the study. With this new expertise, we will incorporate disease risk assessment, molecular function inference and in vitro validation in the new proposal.   E2a. Establish a relationship with researchers on diabetes genetics and disease prevention, namely Adrian Vella M.D. and Steven Smith M.D. at Mayo Clinic.  E2b. Conduct a survey of current approaches to assessing diabetes risk. Using variants identified from our preliminary study, we will test if integrating these novel genetic risk factors with conventional clinical features improves the accuracy of predicting lifetime  risk  and  age  of  onset  of  diabetes  for  individual  patients,  and  predicting disease prevalence on the population level. E2c. Elucidate the upstream regulator and downstream effector genes of the discovered functional DAVs. We will design in vitro experiments to validate the trios. 3.  Justify sample sizes of under-represented populations. The 3,000  5,000 genomes of under-represented population are the largest sample sizes I have  access to. Although genome-wide screening of genetic  risk factors in these samples likely  produces  many  false  positives,  they  shall  provide  a  sufficient  power  for  targeted screening.  To  estimate  the  statistical  power  and  false  discovery  rate,  we  will  perform computer  simulations  of  populations  with  various  levels  of  genetic  heterogeneity,  and calculate the maximum number of candidate variants at a locus and the minimum effect size of functional DAVs for targeted screening.  Timeline for resubmission: Oct. 16, 2019: new R21 to NIDDK focusing on diabetes. Feb. 5, 2019: new R01 to NLM focusing on complex diseases in general. Jun. 5, 2020: new R01 to NIA focusing on Alzheimers disease  Bridging-fund budget:  I request funds to support a full-time research scientist for 12 months who will conduct the proposed pilot studies and prepare manuscripts on our ongoing research on genetic risk factors of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimers disease.

FP00021690,145,,,,,1,,,"Nationally and locally in Arizona, kidney cancer incidence rates have increased over the past several decades, especially in the younger age group (age<50) (1, 2) and also among veterans (3). Kidney cancer was the 4th most common cancer among patients in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System in 2010 (3). Kidney cancer risk factors include obesity, obesity-related health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, family history, genetic factors and race/ethnicity, with African Americans (AAs), Hispanic Americans (HAs), and Native Americans (NAs) having a heavier kidney cancer burden with earlier age of onset and higher incidence and mortality rates than European Americans (EAs) (4-7). The highest kidney cancer mortality rate has been observed in NAs, and NAs have about 2-fold increased risk of kidney cancer mortality compared to EAs (7). Previous renal cell carcinoma (RCC) health disparities studies focused on AAs (8-13). However, HAs and NAs are underrepresented in clinical, molecular, and metabolomic studies of RCC, and RCC molecular and metabolomic profiles among them are not well known (14). For example, frequencies of somatic mutations on commonly mutated genes are different between AA and EA tumors (8), but there is no such information for HAs and NAs. Racial/ethnic minority groups may have different or previously uncharacterized molecular and metabolomic signatures, and it is important to understand molecular and metabolomic signatures in minority groups with a heavy RCC burden.Arizona is uniquely situated to address this need. While nationally the mean age of diagnosis for RCC is 64 (15), we have a unique patient population with a sub-group of them who were diagnosed at a very young age (4). Race/ethnicity and obesity were independently associated with diagnosis before age 50. 50% of NAs and 30% of HAs were diagnosed with RCC before age 50, while only 20% of EA patients were diagnosed before that age. Obesity and diabetes were also more common among HA and NA patients than EA patients.Patients with germline and somatic mutations on the VHL gene for von Hippel-Lindau syndrome develop clear cell RCC (ccRCC) at a young age. Although hereditary ccRCC due to VHL germline mutations accounts for only 3-5% of cases, the VHL is the most commonly altered gene. VHL tumor suppressor inactivation occurs early in ccRCC natural history (16, 17), and metabolomic reprogramming due to obesity may cause VHL alteration and inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes or genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell adhesion through hypermethylation (18-20). However, many patients who were diagnosed at a young age did not have pathogenic VHL germline or somatic mutations or family history, suggesting that other factors may have contributed to early-onset (EO) in HAs, and HAs may have other distinctive molecular signatures. Our preliminary study found that PPP1R1A, a subunit of PP1 (Protein phosphatase 1) that is involved in glycogen metabolism, was down-regulated in EO ccRCC (PADJ<0.05).Increasingly, kidney cancer is being recognized as a metabolic disease, and many mutated genes in RCC, such as VHL and fumarate hydratase (FH), are involved in cellular metabolism activities. VHL regulates the cellular response to hypoxia through its interaction with hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and HIF-1-induced genetic reprogramming promotes a classic Warburg phenotype in RCC through VHL or mechanisms dependent on metabolic enzymes. The inactivation of FH, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, in RCC results in the glucose-mediated generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-dependent HIF-1 stabilization, which consequently enhances aerobic glycolysis and reduces the reliance on mitochondrial respiration in RCC. Moreover, previous studies identified dysregulated metabolic pathways compared to normal tissues (21) and demonstrated that metabolomic profiling can distinguish RCC stages (22, 23). However, metabolomic variation across racial/ethnic groups or metabolomic profile of EO RCC has not been explored in the U.S., and only a few studies explored the metabolomic profile of aggressive RCC in serum (22, 23). We have previously shown that the loss of SETD2, a histone H3 lysine trimethyltransferase frequently inactivated and associated with recurrence of ccRCC, is associated with a metabolic switch in ccRCC cell lines toward enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and lipogenesis (24). The relationships between genomics alteration and metabolomic profiles needs to be further investigated to identify key genomic alterations and metabolic changes occurring early in the ccRCC natural history.",
FP00021753,146,,,,,1,,,"  PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome that is characterized with increased amyloid -protein and tau aggregation in medial temporal lobe regions of the brain that begin before cognitive symptoms. There is a critical need to develop sensitive and readily accessible brain markers to detect AD-related pathophysiology and track decline. In AD, a major goal has been to understand the sequence and time course of  cellular  and  neurovascular  abnormalities  using  brain  imaging  markers.  Further  distinct  clinical  variants  of Alzheimers disease make up 25% of all AD cases. Advanced diffusion and functional imaging may provide evidence  to  better  understand  at  which  stages  synaptic  dysfunction  and  inflammation  contribute  to  various clinical features of cognitive impairment. The PI and colleagues have reported elevated hippocampal free-water is  sensitive  to  staging  along  the  Alzheimers  disease  clinical  continuum.    Understanding  how  previously sensorimotor  network  connectivity  changes  in  the  presence  of  increased  free-water  will  provide  integral knowledge  about  the  nature  of  these  early  changes,  which  has  great  potential  to  improve  patient  care  by facilitating  early  intervention  for  AD      However,  changes  in  sensorimotor  function  with  respect  to  advanced neuroimaging tools has not been comprehensively investigated.  The multimodal assessment of structural and functional imaging techniques has not been characterized within the same participants and tracked over time in preclinical  AD.    In  this  application  in  response  to  PAR-18-19,  Sensory  and  motor  changes  as  predictors  of preclinical AD our central hypothesis is that decreased brain activity during grip motor tasks indicate the presence of AD-related neurodegeneration and can be used in conjunction with free-water imaging to track progression over time.  The rationale is that increased free-water measures in medial temporal regions alters brain activity and this may depend on the mode of sensory feedback elicited during these grip motor tasks.  We will study how advanced dMRI and fMRI measures affects preclinical AD progression using a longitudinal study design. Aim 1 studies free-water markers of medial temporal structures and sensorimotor networks over 1 year, Aim 2 studies a task-based fMRI marker of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area differentiates staging of preclinical AD,  Aim 3 studies longitudinal changes in fMRI marker of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area in preclinical AD and help differentiate sub-types of preclinical AD, Aim 4 evaluates the ability of cross-sectional  and  longitudinal  dMRI  and  fMRI  predict  future  decline  in  cognition,  clinical  conversion,  and amyloid  status.  Successful  completion  of  these  aims  has  the  potential  to  alter  the  current  concepts  and methodologies of early diagnosis and time course of preclinical AD, which in turn will support the development of  sensorimotor  measures  as  accessible  and  cost-effective  diagnostic  and  progression  markers  for  use  in screening, diagnosis, and clinical trials of AD therapies.

FP00021757,147,,,,,1,,,"Rationale: Our long-term goal is to identify metabolic vulnerabilities induced by SETD2 mutations, which will provide innovative and effective approaches to reduce the threat of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to human health. Mutations in the histone lysine N-methyltransferase SETD2 occur in 32% of RCC. Previous studies1-2 indicated that in RCC cell lines and patient-derived tumors, SETD2 mutations are associated with loss of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), transcriptional alterations, global DNA hypermethylation, and clinically a 3-fold higher risk of metastases and decreased survival. These epigenetic mutations have vital clinical utilities, and they are directly relevant to a clinical focus area of gaps in cancer prevention, early detection/diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and/or survivorship.Chromatin modifications are closely linked to metabolism, and dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of many cancers. A recent publication3 found that loss of SETD2 induces a metabolic switch in RCC cell lines toward enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. SETD2 null isogenic cells had elevated levels of ATP, glycolytic/mitochondrial respiratory capacity, citrate synthase activity, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. In addition, SETD2 deficient cells showed disturbed gene networks related to mitochondrial metabolism and oxidation of fatty acids, which was associated with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor transcriptional coactivator (PGC-1a), a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, major limitations of this published study include that 1) it was based on 2D cell culture that does not recapitulate solid tumor conditions, and 2) it did not address fatty acid oxidation.Objectives: To address this fundamental gap prior to future clinical applications, the overall objective in this proposal is to achieve a better understanding of metabolic reprogramming associated with SETD2 mutations in RCC under physiologically more relevant conditions using 3D cultures and mouse models. Our central hypothesis is that SETD2 dysregulation modifies the RCC phenotype by inducing a distinct metabolic reprogramming via dysregulation of PGC-1a or CPT1A that control the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, respectively.Methods: We will examine our working hypothesis (Fig. 1), through testing the following Specific Aims.Aim 1. We will identify metabolic alterations in the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, comparing isogenic SETD2 cell line pairs (KO and wild-type) in 3D culture. We will use 4 independent pairs of SETD2 isogenic cell lines (human and mouse). Aim 1a: we will test whether increased TCA respiration in SETD2-deficient cells leads to increased fatty acid synthesis. Aim 1b: we will test whether the metabolic flux in central carbon metabolism is altered to induce increased fatty acid synthesis in SETD2-deficient cells. Aim 1c: for potential translational applications, we will determine if functional suppression/overexpression of PGC-1a or CPT1A is sufficient to reverse the SETD2-mediated changes of metabolite levels and fluxes.Aim 2. We will examine metabolic changes of the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism due to SETD2 dysregulation in immunocompetent murine RENCA models. Tumor samples will be collected from NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice injected with parental or SETD2 KO RENCA cells. We will measure both metabolic levels (Aim 2a) and dynamic metabolic fluxes (Aim 2b). In addition, we will explore the effects of functional suppression/overexpression of PGC-1a or CPT1A (Aim 2c), which ultimately will provide a promising therapeutic approach.Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Approaches: It is possible, although quite unlikely, that we will find no connection between SETD2 mutations and the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism under physiologically relevant conditions. In such a case, we would use the state-of-the-art metabolomics profiling methods and platforms, and concentrate our efforts on profiling >2,500 metabolites and >35 metabolic pathways, many of which have been reported to be affected by epigenetic mutations and cancer. These metabolites include oncometabolites, lipids, nucleosides, organic and amino acids, and a broad range of other metabolites of biological significance. Therefore, we are confident that we will discover at least a few significant metabolites and metabolic pathways highly related to SETD2 mutations in cancer, even under physiological conditions.Fig.1.WorkingHypothesis:elevatedTCAmetabolites(green)inSETD2-deficientcellsmaybeshuntedtowardfattyacidaccumulation,leadingtocancermetastasis.CPT1A",
FP00021826,148,,,,,1,,,"Children with hearing loss have smaller vocabularies than their peers with normal hearing. A common assumption is that hearing loss prevents the formation of clear auditory representations of new words in memory. Although it is not possible to examine a childs auditory representations directly, there is ample evidence that hearing loss degrades childrens: 1) perception of familiar and unfamiliar words, 2) perception of vocal prosody and emotion, 3) production of speech, and 4) precise localization of sound sources. Children with hearing loss also require more exposures to learn new words than children with normal hearing and they retain fewer words over time. To learn a new word, children must associate the acoustic properties of the word with a referent over multiple exposures in acoustically diverse contexts. There is evidence that words presented under acoustically varying conditions, like different individual talkers or listening environments, decreases speed and accuracy of word recognition while increasing later recall of the words from memory. These distinct perceptual effects suggest that auditory perception is highly sensitive to variations in the acoustic signal. Therefore, the central hypothesis to be tested in this project is that perception of acoustic variation in the auditory signal improves retention of newly learned words. If this hypothesis is valid, better retention of newly learned words will be observed in children who are able to access the acoustic variability in the auditory signal compared to children who cannot. To test this prediction, word recognition and word learning will be examined in 8- to 15-year-old children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss compared to peers with normal hearing. In each of seven experiments, children will learn 5 nonsense words without acoustic variations and 5 nonsense words with acoustic variations that represent daily communication. All words will be presented auditorily and the children with hearing loss will be tested with and without amplification that meets prescriptive targets for each childs degree and configuration of loss. Retention of the nonsense words will be measured with four-alternative forced-choice identification tasks immediately after learning and again 7 days later. Each aim will target a different acoustic domain representative of daily communication: 1) variations in speech acoustics including prosody, emotion, and multiple individual talkers, 2) variations in spatial acoustics including localization and motion, and 3) environmental acoustics including auditory scenes and reverberation. The acoustic characteristics selected for the first, second, and third aim vary in low-frequency, high-frequency, and broadband-frequency regions, respectively. Additionally, the source of the acoustic variations progress from those directly, indirectly, and not related to the talker, also respectively. The outcomes of these aims will separately and together specify the contribution of commonly occurring acoustic variations to word learning. The results of this research will have immediate and long-term impact on the interventions prescribed to children with hearing loss including hearing-aid signal processing that preserves acoustic variations determined to support vocabulary development.",
FP00021876,149,,,,,1,,,"Cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases with diverse clinical characteristics and molecular profiles. Decades of research have discovered many germline genetic risk variants that confer hereditary cancer susceptibilities, and somatic driver mutations that promote malignant transformations of body cells. Because somatic mutations arise in the background of an individuals germline genome, pre-existing germline variants may influence which synergistic somatic mutations are needed to drive tumorigenesis. Thus, these two groups of variants and their interactions together affect a tumors clinical phenotype, such as histological subtype, metastasis sites, and response to treatments. However, as current studies mostly examine germline and somatic variants independently, our knowledge of germline-somatic interactions (GxS) is very limited. To address this knowledge gap and to facilitate precision oncology, we propose a novel computational framework, Variants Interacting in Germline and Soma (VIGAS) that jointly assess the functional impact of these two groups of variants. We will develop a suite of bioinformatics methods to discover and characterize GxS via integrative analysis of multi-omics data. We will examine various types of genetic variants in coding and noncoding regions. Unlike existing methods that use simple metrics based on co-occurrences of germline and somatic variants, the VIGAS methods aim to discover GxS with biological significance. We will pursue three specific aims. Aim 1: we will develop a VIGAS-e method to discover GxS based on evolutionary selection, in which germline contexts influence evolutionary advantages of somatic mutations. Aim 2: we will develop a VIGAS-t method to discover GxS based on transcriptional regulation, in which germline contexts influence transcriptional patterns of genes harboring somatic mutations. Aim 3: we will apply VIGAS to >10,000 tumors from >30 cancer types to identify GxS by cancer type and by pan-cancer group, such as pan-squamous and pan-gastrointestinal cancers. Comparisons across cancer types will reveal associations of GxS with tissue specificity, as well as the risk of developing cancers in different organs.

FP00021950_Res1,152,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary/Abstract Many biological analytes of interest to both clinical oncologists and cancer researchers are unstable when the unfixed biospecimens in which they reside are exposed to thawed conditions. For example, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines state that the post-excision-up-to-fixation exposure time span for tissues collected for clinical HER2 testing in breast cancer must be less than 1 hour. For blood plasma/serum and many types of tissue specimens that are to be frozen, the proper cold storage temperature is well below the common laboratory freezer temperature of -20 C. For this and many other reasons, every year improprieties and inconsistencies in pre-analytical sample handling and storage generate unacceptably large numbers of costly false leads in biomedical research. Unsurprisingly, experts in the field agree that this problem must be minimized immediately. Currently there are few tools and not so much as one widely accepted approach by which to implement evidence-based tracking of biospecimen exposure to thawed conditions. In practice, it is actually quite rare for biomedical researchers to employ any evidence-based QA/QC tools at allwhich suggests that easy-to-use, individual aliquot-level thawed-state indicators could have a major impact on improving biospecimen quality tracking and therefore actual quality.  Here, we will develop color change-based indicators designed for 12 different biospecimen handling/storage requirements that ultimately will be implemented by placement into custom-designed dual-chambered, flex-activated (like a glow-stick) see-through devices that can be housed on (notched into) the outside of a specially designed sample storage vial. Once the bright pink color of permanganate (Mn(VII)) in the indicator turns clear due to its reduction to Mn(II) (as easily seen from the outside of the storage vial), this indicates that the specimen inside the vial has been exposed to a time-temperature span that is outside of the allowed storage/handling parameters. Importantly, subsets of these indicators will not freeze until -33.5 C or -76 C, facilitating the unprecedented ability to track exposures to very cold, but nevertheless improper storage temperaturesall in a manner that will be difficult to ignore by anyone handling the samples. Development of these indicators will be accomplished via two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Establish kinetic control of the permanganate/oxalate reaction system by designing reaction starting conditions so that 12 uniquely useful time/temperature indicating solutions are developed. Specific Aim 2: Verify that reaction kinetics and temperature sensitivities for the 12 indicators behave as expectedthat is, A) accurately, precisely (reproducibly), and with substantially increasing run times at 25 C, 4 C, 0 C, and -20 Cand B) remain accurate and precise when different stock solutions, reagent lots, analysts, or varying periods of freezing are involved.

FP00022004,156,,,,,1,,,"Epidemiology studies and animal experiments have demonstrated that developmental exposure to persistent environmental toxicants polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is associated with increased neurological disorder prevalence and neurotoxic phenotypes in adulthood. However, mechanisms governing early life PDBE exposure and neurotoxicity remain unknown. Current literature supports a mechanistic link between gut microbiome and brain functions in humans and animal models, through the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA). In addition, we showed that oral exposure to PBDEs in adult mice results in dysbiosis with profound changes in bacteria known to be associated with inflammation and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are known to play an important role along the MGBA. Building on these findings, we seek to establish a causal relationship among developmental PBDE exposure, gut microbiome dysbiosis, altered SCFA profiles along the MGBA, and neurotoxicity later in life, using C57BL/6J CV mice in conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) background. We hypothesize that developmental PBDE exposure causes acute and persistent dysbiosis in gut microbiome and imbalance of SCFA profiles along the MGBA, which at least partially contributes to neurotoxicity in early life and beyond. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will determine if developmental PBDE exposure perturbs the gut microbiome and SCFA profiles along the MGBA, leading to neurotoxicity in early life and beyond. In Aim 2 we will determine that reprogramming the gut microbiome using fecal transplant mechanistically contributes to developmental PBDE exposure-mediated neurotoxicity. We will perform fecal transplant to CV pups with early life PBDEs, from CV pups without PBDE exposure, to determine whether healthy microbiota can at least partially restore SCFA imbalance and rescue PBDE-mediated neurological phenotypes. Notably, to differentiate endogenous and gut-derived SCFAs, we will track 13C-SCFAs that are produced from 13C-resistant starch by gut microbiota in vivo. The expected outcome of the proposed research is a new research paradigm demonstrating that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome mechanistically contributes to early life PBDE exposure-induced neurotoxicity later in life, and more importantly, enables a novel, therapeutic approach to intervene neurological diseases among populations with high risk of PBDE exposure, especially those children in the U.S.",

These biannual surveys will specifically capture each participants perceived changes in knowledge, confidence, practice patterns, number of patients with OUD in their clinic, etc. by asking where they were prior to attending the ECHO program and where they are now on specific measures. Please see Appendix A for an example of this survey format. The number of DATA-waived participants is also assessed via the bi-weekly CE survey, such as number waivered providers, number of OUD patients in the panel, and delivery of evidenced-based content. Capacity needs to be teased out using survey logic; current data reflect the interdisciplinarity of the ECHO participant group. Program participants have included physicians (15%), advanced practice providers (28%), behavioral health providers (25%), and other provider types (e.g. medical assistants, health educators) (21%), consistent with the interdisciplinary program the team intended to build.",

FP00022106,162,,,,,1,,,"Performance athletes are human beings first and athletes by choice. It is only when student-athletes disengage, underperform or display unbecoming behaviors that we are reminded of this fact. An in-dept analysis reveals that most significant behavior changes can be traced back to student-athletes challenges outside the athletic facilities [1, 2]. These challenges are known to affect their behaviors, athletics engagement and ultimately their wellbeing. The main factors identified as having a significant effect on student-athlete wellbeing are: life transitions; environmental changes; social-emotional life; etc.; all happening off-court. As a consequence, in the absence of consistent off-court data, the decision makers and people in charge with SA wellbeing, have to operate heuristically and rely primarily on (educated) intuition.It is generally difficult (or impossible) even for trained specialists to detect most micro-behavioral changes precluding the onset of catastrophic behavioral changes on account of their complex and subtle manifestations and also because of a chronic lack of access to students off-court data. Fortunately, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms excel at exactly this type of detection. While direct (human) observation of (micro)behaviors is prohibitive, the devices and software required to record the datasets needed to train and deploy ML/AI micro-behaviors detection algorithms is extremely cost effective and if applied correctly non-intrusive and not infringing on students privacy. Furthermore, these patterns of behavior are far from being unexplainable, unpredictable or uncorrectable [3, 4]. It is only our limited access to the off-court information and the lack of proper tools and methodologies that prevents us from predicting, preventing or correcting these behaviors and ultimately affecting the wellbeing and athletic performance of thousands of student-athletes. We propose here the creation of a scalable ML and AI driven data platform and intervention to support SA wellbeing and performance on and off-court.",
FP00022119,163,,,,,1,,,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and, in the US, young adults between ages 20-24 have the highest rates of HPV infection. Infection with this virus can cause various forms of cancer as well as non-cancerous genital warts. Fortunately, a commercially available 9-valent HPV vaccines offer the potential immunity against the strains that cause the majority of HPV-related cancers. Unfortunately, the US has not reached an HPV vaccine uptake rate that would stop the spread of this common infection. Increasing HPV vaccination rates among the age-eligible population, particularly targeting college students, a population which is largely insured, is one way to help stop the spread of HPV. Past interventions with college students have aimed to increase HPV awareness and intentions to vaccinate. Few have aimed to change vaccination behaviors. Further, interventions that did measure behavior change have had modest results. This research seeks to build on what works, using evidence-based health education strategies to increase HPV awareness, perceived susceptibility, positive attitudes towards the vaccine, and intentions to vaccinate and expand to increase self-efficacy to vaccinate and, moreover, actual HPV vaccine uptake (behavior). This cluster randomized controlled study (clustered by campus) pairs this research-proven educational strategy with a vaccine implementation strategy, a pop-up, mobile HPV vaccine clinic held in a public location on campus. Both the intervention and control groups will receive the HPV vaccine educational component. Student organizations will be randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention groups will have immediate access to the mobile HPV vaccine clinic. The control group will be given an information card with student health services information. The intervention will be carried out by a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student. The vaccine clinics will be hosted by campus registered nurses and a medical assistant, current staff of the universitys student health services. The aims of this intervention research are twofold: 1) compare the effectiveness of an HPV vaccine implementation strategy (mobile HPV vaccine clinic) versus the standard care of providing information to the health student center  in increasing HPV vaccine uptake behavior; and 2) conduct mixed methods research to explore the acceptability and also barriers/facilitators to implementation of the HPV vaccine implementation strategy. Study results will provide insight into the preliminary efficacy of disseminating an HPV vaccine intervention via a sustainable outreach approach. This same strategy, if proven effective, can be used for increasing other immunizations (e.g. flu, meningitis B).",

Proposal Summary Cancer runs in families, even for so-called sporadic cases. International surveys of over 10 million individuals estimated that having an affected first-degree relative significantly increases the risk of various cancers, ranging from 8% higher risk for lung cancers to 53% higher risk for thyroid cancers.  Furthermore, the prognosis among first- or second-degree relatives is also highly correlated. These observations unambiguously point to a significant hereditary component of cancers. However, all genetic risk factors known to date explain at most 20% of the heritability for each cancer type.  The large amount of hidden heritability poses a major obstacle to precision risk assessment and individualized cancer prevention.  Meanwhile, because the cancer-driving activity of a genetic variation depends on other co-existing variations, the search for new risk factors involves examining a myriad of combinations, which surpasses the capacity of traditional experimental assays.  To address this challenge, my lab has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) technique that mimics tumor development and detects cancer-driving events computationally.  We applied this technique to studying a key cancer driver gene. We discovered a novel genetic change that confers susceptibility to lung cancers but protection from brain cancers.  This example represents a group of cancer drivers that function in a context-dependent mechanism. When a person inherits such a genetic variation from his/her parent (germline), its influence is masked until a body cell in a specific tissue acquires a specific mutation later in life (somatic).  Cancer risks associated with such germline-somatic-tissue (GST) trios are extremely difficult to detect with conventional approaches. In this application, we designed an AI-guided functional study to discover GST trios in 33 cancer types and to assess the clinical significance of our findings. Our specific aims are (1) Apply our AI technique to established genomes of >10,000 tumors of 33 cancer types. We will discover GST trios for each cancer type and for pan-cancer groups, e.g., all cancers involving squamous cells or all cancers affecting the digestive system. We will examine contributions of novel genetic risk factors to the hidden heritability, and evaluate their predictive power to forecast the most likely primary cancer site, the most likely metastatic site, age at diagnosis and overall survival for individual patients. (2) Validate tumor-promoting functions of top-ranked GST trios that confer the highest cancer risks using cellular assays. We will engineer human cell lines to introduce GST mutations and test cancer hallmark characteristics.  (3) Release the AI method as an open-source software and create an online database to disseminate our discoveries to the community.  Our study will generate information critical to realize precision oncology, especially for individualized risk assessment and targeted therapies. Important findings will help initiate multiple clinical trials. This endeavor will help put ASU on the map of next-generation AI-aided cancer management. The cross-disciplinary collaboration provides an excellent environment for student training, preparing them for future challenges. Therefore, our effort aligns with ASUs 2020 goals, i.e., striving for excellence and innovation, access to students, and ultimately greater good of the society.

FP00022137,166,,,,,1,,,"Our health and healthcare systems are challenged to identify which interventions and programs work for which individuals, and which communities. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Arizona communities are diverse with multiple micro-climates of community health, brought together by a shared geographical identity, yet separated by disparate health outcomes. We also share diverse institutions dedicated to community health, including multi-specialty hospitals (e.g., Mayo Clinic, Banner Health), community clinics (e.g., Mountain Park, Adelante), and research institutes (e.g., Barrow Neurological, TGen). These entities capture rich forms of health data that, if brought together, could maximize our ability to improve community health, promote healthy lifestyles, and eliminate health inequities in Arizona. These goals address the ASU 2020 Campaign priority to enrich our communities. Analysis of linked data from various sectors has proven beneficial for healthcare. For example, in Durham, North Carolina, health data overlaid with geographical and census information resulted in better administration of social and emergency services and enhanced care of diabetic individuals. ASU, through the College of Health Solutions (CHS), is well-positioned to lead an effort to harmonize health data through a ASU Community Cohort, a physical and virtual repository of biological, clinical, behavioral, geospatial, social, and environmental data collected from Arizona patients and volunteers. This effort will lead to improved health programs, more actionable health data, and data-driven innovations for individual and population-level health. The ASU Community Cohort repository will establish a resource to track community health parameters; identify underlying biologic-behavior-environment signatures predictive of health; inform community targets for change (behavioral, social, political); facilitate community partner and research volunteer engagement; and provide accessible, high-quality biospecimens for biomarker-based research at ASU. Our team includes experts in biomarker assessment and storage (Whisner, Sears, Vega-Lopez, Gu), behavioral assessment (Buman, Tasevska), geospatial health determinants (Adams), social health determinants (Bruening, Vega-Lopez), biomedical informatics (Scotch, Runger), and participant registry and database management (Rao, Gray). Our team has long-standing partnerships with most major hospitals, community clinics, and health research institutes across Arizona and a pipeline of $5M+/year of federally-funded, community-based research that will immediately populate this repository.The Arizona Wellbeing Commons, a multi-institution initiative to tackle pressing health issues, brings together Arizonan researchers, clinicians, community partners, and students but it lacks a harmonized repository for sharing archived data and biological samples. The novel resources in CHS (e.g., State-of-the-art wet lab facilities, Application Programming Core,) will allow us to archive biological samples and develop a data repository that catalogs available data and increases access for community partners, while maintaining high levels of data security/encryption. ASU can be the leader in improving health at scale for Arizona by bringing together the rich and diverse forms of data our community generates. The ASU Community Cohort stands to address community health on a scale never attempted within Arizona. Development of a platform that harmonizes diverse and multi-modal data, from a variety of community partners, will allow ASU to fuel more rapid discovery and enrich our communities by addressing the complex challenges that currently prevent all Arizonans from achieving healthy lifestyles.",
FP00022151,167,,,,,1,,,"Statement of Work Arizona State University (ASU) will conduct a multi-method research design to assess tenants understanding of their rights and assess their interest in training and advocacy in order to reduce their housing eviction rates. ASU will employ Participatory Action Research (PAR), a community-engaged research methodology that directly builds community capacity through involving people in research who in turn can take actions to improve their own conditions. The research will involve two sites, Tempe and Tucson. Community Researchers will be identified at each site and using PAR, a needs assessment will be conducted, and eviction resources developed. ASU will also undertake a formative and summative evaluation framework where the research team will compile and review the performance data collected and report findings to the program director and project partner representatives.     Research Plan and Evaluation Methodology  We will conduct a multi-method research design to assess tenants understanding of their rights and assess their interest in training and advocacy in order to reduce their housing eviction rates.  Research Plan Our community engaged research project will involve community members throughout the research process to ensure solutions are designed and implemented in direct response to identified needs, assets, constraints, and preferences of communities. Specifically, we will use Participatory Action Research (PAR) (Bilandzic & Venable, 2011), a community-engaged research methodology that directly builds community capacity through involving people in research who in turn can take actions to improve their own conditions (Baum, MacDougall, & Smith, 2006). Our research will involve two sites, Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas, selected because they are the two largest metropolitan areas in Arizona and have a higher percentage of residents at-risk for eviction from housing.  Phase 1 (Months 1-12): Assembling Research Team & Needs Assessment Our first activity will be to identify individuals and organizations in Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas who will form the core research team along with Arizona Housing Coalition and ASU researchers.  These community members are referred to as community researchers (CRs), who along with the research team will form the hybrid research team which will guide and direct the project. To identify the CRs, the Arizona Housing Coalition, Southwest Fair Housing Council and ASU team will work together, identifying individual housing activists and persons from formal or informal groups working on housing rights in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas area. In total, we anticipate identifying five community researchers in each location.  After assembling the hybrid research teams in both locations, the team will conduct a needs assessment consisting of dialogue between team members with local knowledge of housing issues and semi-structured interviews with community members who have experienced or are at risk of eviction, landlords, and local housing officials (Kindon, Pain, & Kesby, 2007). The needs assessment will seek to answer the questions: 1) what are the needs of residents at risk for eviction or recently evicted? 2) What resources do people who are at risk for or recently evicted need? 3) What eviction resources exist? 4) What are the barriers to accessing existing eviction resources?  Phase 2 (Months 13-18): Design of Eviction Resources In phase 2, the hybrid research team will synthesize results from the needs assessment to design resource materials to reduce eviction and convey tenants rights to individuals at risk for eviction intended. Resources will be developed for intended use by municipal governments and residents. While we cannot know in advance the precise design of the resources which will be designed, we anticipate it may contain elements such as an accessible set of resources such as emergency rent resources and detailed and accessible information related to navigating housing law and court procedures and a set of best practices for local governments. The hybrid team will create a prototype of the resources, then conduct user testing in the form of short, structured interviews with end users to refine the design and implementation plan. We anticipate that the resources will be made available in both analog forms (through local social services organizations) and digital (through a central, publicly accessible website) formats.  Phase 3 (Months 19-36): Implementation + Ongoing Evaluation and Adjustment The hybrid study team will create an implementation plan for the resources based on the needs assessment conducted in phase 1, to directly surmount barriers to accessing resources and make the resources available in a format(s) that will provide the most access possible for individuals at risk for eviction. The hybrid study team will then follow the implementation plan, adjusting implementation to accommodate new information about the needs of the target population as they go.  Evaluation Methodology We will undertake a formative and summative evaluation framework throughout this project. Figure 1 depicts a Logic Model that classifies the various input, process, output, and outcome measures. The research team will compile and review the performance data collected and report findings to the program director and project partner representatives.  Figure 1: Logic Model   Once the resources have been publicly released, the hybrid study team will conduct a longitudinal mixed-methods evaluation of the resources. The evaluation will consist of statistical measures of resource access and eviction outcomes assessed quarterly; 2) ongoing dialogue about the resources use and effectiveness by community researchers interacting with their local communities; and 3) brief surveys of users (both those seeking eviction help and those providing eviction help) administered when individuals access the resources online or from a local community organization. Mixed-methods evaluation data will be reviewed by the hybrid study team monthly after implementation, and each month the study team will make a list of design modifications based on evaluation data. These design modifications will be implemented to continuously refine the design of the resources in the field. Finally, at the end of the study period, the hybrid study team will carry out a comprehensive evaluation and create a plan for sustainability of the resources over time, including plans for stewardship by the local housing organizations (Southwest Fair Housing Council and Arizona Housing Coalition) and transition materials and oversight to these organizations.

FP00022158,168,,,,,1,,,"The aim of this two-year proposal is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a supplement education campaign to influence the Attitudes, Knowledge and Behavior of student-athletes and athletic department staff toward dietary supplements.During the first 6 months, baseline information will be gathered from each of the partner institutions about student-athletes predisposing attitudes, beliefs and knowledge related to supplement education. All partner institutions will ensure at least a 20% participation rate of student-athletes in the program evaluation. This data will be used to create a central program as well as help develop a theoretical approach for addressing these factors. After 6 months (start January 2021), we will launch the supplement education program. Our evaluation approach will be implemented both during and after the proposal, including process evaluation components (program implementation) and outcome evaluation components (i.e., did attitudes, knowledge and behaviors change?). From the start of 2022, the program will be adjusted based on insights collected during the evaluations. The following complimentary institutional data will be collected; anonimyzed data on external and internal drug testing, student-athlete visits at registered dieticians, information sessions, student-athlete and staff attendance of activities, meetings regarding the education program, permissible supplement budget vs. use and individual student-athlete input based on a questionnaire, quiz, and-or other potential measure. Successful outcomes of this project will be 1) the development, implementation and evaluation of a Pac-12-wide education program on dietary supplements for student-athletes; 2) defined roles and responsibilities for athletic staff about supplement education, behavior and monitoring; and 3) insight into the attitudes, knowledge and behaviors of student-athletes toward dietary supplements. Finally, the evaluation tools, i.e., questionnaires, scoring charts and standard operating procedures, will be developed. These evaluation tools can be utilized after the end of the proposal period by the five partner institutions for follow-up monitoring.",

FP00022192,170,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARYOverview:Visual maps provide hearing with an important frame of reference to guide ongoing goals and expectations, but the space encoded by these two modalities does not always align. For foveal species like humans and monkeys, the visual field is restricted to the frontal space, whereas the auditory field is panoramic, covering the entire frontal and rear space. The rear space, however, has been largely overlooked in multisensory research. To our knowledge, no cortical studies have investigated how visual input influences panoramic auditory spatial processing. Furthermore, few theoretical studies have investigated how cortical network oscillations facilitate interactions between vision and audition in space or how existing theories of multisensory perception might be implemented in neural circuits. Through integrated experimental studies, predictive statistical modeling, and mechanistic computational modeling, we will investigate visual modulation of sound location information in a panoramic auditory space. Our central hypothesis is that visuo-spatial information can enhance both focal and global analysis of auditory events by changing the directional preference of network dynamics. Electrophysiological experiments will provide a comprehensive assessment of the spatial tuning of auditory cortex neurons under various visual conditions. Statistical models will determine the important features that drive spiking in cortical neurons and will predict spiking output. Mechanistic models will use these identified features to delineate the microcircuit level mechanisms for visual modulation with a focus on the layer-specific interactions between local rhythm generators and single-unit activity. The integrated analysis will characterize cortical multisensory control, including the involvement of attentional inputs (alpha rhythm) and auditory-evoked inputs through superficial and deep gating circuits (gamma/beta rhythms).  Intellectual Merit:Our collaboration will advance the understanding of neural mechanisms for multisensory spatial perception in the primate brain. Statistical and computational models for single-neuron and circuit-level mechanisms will provide detailed and efficient studies of auditory cortical function that are not limited to processing sound parameters but include dynamic modulation via visual factors, as occurs in real-life environments. Because these models will specifically link multisensory inputs with neuronal responses, they will have broad applications in sensory and cognitive neuroscience, with the ultimate goal of understanding the relationship between perception and stimuli from the sensory environment.  Broader Impacts:SCIENTIFIC: The proposed activities will provide insight into the fundamental strategies of multisensory perception and the cortical neural mechanisms that implement these strategies in the brain. The impact of this work will be maximized through sharing of data in standardized formats, rigorous and transparent model validation, and use of model description standards for model sharing, which allows for code generation for simulating models in many different programming languages or simulation platforms for model re-use. All software pipelines will be open source and will be shared with comprehensive documentation and video tutorials. EDUCATIONAL: This work will provide further impact through undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training opportunities, contributing to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. ASU undergraduate students are highly encouraged to participate in research during their studies. The investigators will invite undergraduates to participate in the proposed research through existing undergraduate research programs: the NIH-funded Workforce Inclusion in Neuroscience through Undergraduate Research Experience (WINMURE) program, the NSF-sponsored Mentoring Through Critical Points (MCTP) Program, and several ASU-based inclusion programs. We also will impact teaching and learning by developing innovative, active learning modules for data analysis in neuroscience that center around the themes of this proposal.  Modules will focus on open source neuroscience data and analysis of these data within the context of specific neurobiological questions to teach statistical methods and data science. The use of Jupyter notebooks will provide a web-based front-end for data analysis and visualization in modules and also increase the accessibility of the materials for learners in many settings and with a wide range of backgrounds.

FP00022205,171,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary Overview:  In  this  Pilot  and  Feasibility  Project,  we  propose  to  broaden  the  participation  in  STEM  of Burundian refugee families living in the Phoenix metropolitan area. We will achieve our goals of improving STEM career aspirations among children and parents by focusing on 24 families organized into four Family Circles. Guided by social cognitive career theory and research regarding the influence of family, we are mustering and adapting existing resources and creating new experiences to affect childrens self-efficacy, STEM identity, interests, and aspirations to pursue STEM learning and STEM careers. Correspondingly, we will impact familial college social capital and STEM capital by engaging families in tailored informal learning experiences. Specifically, families with children ages 12-17, will participate in the following:   Host  living  room  outreach  events  facilitated  by  students  and  faculty  from  Arizona  State  University (ASU) that excite people about STEM and societal career connections  Participate in an adapted award-winning 8-session program focused on college-knowledge, enabling parents to be effective advocates for their children, and building a bridge to higher education  Meet and interact with STEM professionals, with e-mentoring for older children  Participate in field trips to multiple university campuses to interact with faculty and students and learn about college life and various STEM pathways   Participate in informal STEM learning experiences of choice and share with other families This project,  STEM and Social Capital: Advancing Families through Learning and Doing (SSCAFLD), creates  new  partnerships  among  multiple  schools  and  centers  at  ASU  with  the  Burundi-America Association  for  Humanity  and  Opportunities  (BAAHO).  SSCAFLD  provides  a  transformative  way  of marshaling resources to provide STEM learning experiences that bolster representation of refugee families.  Intellectual  Merit:  We  will  advance  knowledge  by  addressing  our  research  questions  that  are  framed around  social  cognitive  career  theory.  By  orchestrating  multiple  informal  learning  experiences,  we  will determine  their  composite  and  specific  effects  on  childrens  self-efficacy,  STEM  identity,  outcome expectations, and STEM interests, in support of their STEM goals. Prior studies have examined parental impact by typically asking students to reflect on family influence; however, in this study, we gain first-hand understanding by including parents as both project and research participants. We aim to understand how college social capital and STEM capital, among underrepresented families, both directly impacts and acts as a moderator on childrens STEM aspirations. In sum, knowledge and experience gained from this project clears the path toward supporting underrepresented communities via family-focused non-traditional means.  Broader Impacts: Our project has broader impact through inclusion, research, and outreach innovation. Via  inclusion    refugees  have  been  overlooked,  if  not  disregarded,  by  traditional  educational  supports. Beyond  the  Phoenix  area  Burundian  community,  we  will  impact  refugee  outreach  through  our dissemination  plan  which  includes  direct  communication  with  the  International  Rescue  Committee  and plans  to  expand  to  other  refugee  communities.  Via  research    by  advancing  knowledge  of  how  STEM career aspirations are influenced by informal learning experiences and by families learning together, this project impacts societal goals of promoting STEM and developing a STEM-ready workforce because it helps us understand influences on career decisions, particularly among underrepresented groups and their STEM  paths.  This  is  especially  meaningful  for  STEM  matriculation  and  higher  education  recruitment efforts. Via outreach innovation  this project acts as an innovative outreach model for practitioners and researchers that leverages existing strengths and dedicates resources to a targeted population. Our family-focused model is unique and has the potential to impact future outreach efforts at ASU and other institutions to support underrepresented populations, particularly refugee communities. ",
FP00022263,172,,,,,1,,,"Compared to normal-hearing listeners, cochlear implant (CI) users have significantly worse speech recognition in noise, most likely due to the limited spectral resolution with CIs. Various spectral ripple tests have been used to measure spectral resolution with CIs and their results have been shown to correlate with speech recognition. Thus, there is a fast-growing interest in using these tests to assess CI outcomes and evaluate CI processing strategies. However, the perceptual and learning mechanisms of various spectral ripple tests are still in debate. This proposal aims to address these concerns and provide scientific evidence for the clinical and research use of spectral ripple tests. We hypothesize that CI performance in spectral ripple detection, phase discrimination, and  density  discrimination  would  all  reflect  spectral  resolution,  although  spectral  ripple  detection  and  density discrimination  may  also  involve  temporal  processing.  We  also  hypothesize  that  target  training  (rather  than repeated  testing)  of  spectral  ripple  density  discrimination  may  improve  CI  performance  in  not  only  spectral ripple perception but also speech recognition in noise. We will test these hypotheses by pursuing two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will compare different spectral ripple tests with narrow-band stimuli centered on individual electrodes  to  forward  making  pattern  and  temporal  amplitude  modulation  detection  measured  on  the corresponding electrodes. Different spectral ripple tests, temporal amplitude modulation detection, and speech recognition measured with broad-band stimuli across the electrode array will also compared to each other. The comprehensive  comparisons  of  spectral  and  temporal  processing  will  reveal  how  much  does  each  spectral ripple  test  reflect  spectral  resolution  and  involve  temporal  processing.  Specific  Aim  2  will  develop  a  novel training  task  of  spectral  ripple  density  discrimination  and  compare  the  effects  of  target  training  and  repeated testing  on  spectral  ripple  perception,  temporal  amplitude  modulation  detection  and  speech  recognition.  The results  will  have  significant  implications  for  the  use  of  spectral  ripple  tests  as  a  clinical  and  research  tool  to assess and enhance spectral resolution and in turn, speech recognition of CI users.

FP00022308,173,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, which is responsible for roughly 5% of all cancers. Almost 80 million Americans are infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus that causes various cancers (e.g. cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal) and non-cancerous genital warts. Based on cancer registry data from 2011 to 2015 about 42,700 new cases of HPV-associated cancers occurred in the United States each year, including about 24,400 women and 18,300 men. HPV is considered to be a cause of nearly all cervical cancers, approximately 90% of anal cancers, 75% of vagina, 69% of vulvar, 63% of penile, vaginal, 70% of oropharyngeal cancers, and 32% of oral cavity cancers. The  finding  of  observed  disparities  influencing  HPV-associated  cancers  risk  leads  us  to  understand  why disparities  in  cancer  outcomes  persist  by  identifying  factors  contributing  to  disparities  and  their  relative importance. Cancer disparities data rely on cross-sectional based approaches and do not consider the time-variant and dynamic nature in disparities. Further, this research mainly examines race/ethnicity, as well as socio-economic status, to draw assumptions related to HPV-associated cancer disparities. It has failed to consider the community-level factors, such as access to health care, vaccine schedules, state-wide HPV vaccine policies, risk factor profiles, patient experience and care variables, health-related quality of life measures, and cancer related information like cancer site, stage, and treatment. Our proposed study seeks to fill this research gap. We hypothesize  that  trajectory-based  modeling  approaches  considering  behavioral,  social,  and  community-level factors will lead to the better understanding of factors influencing disparities compared to the current approach of time-invariant based analyses. In order to fulfill this research gap, we will use latent class growth methods (LCGMs)  within  a  longitudinal  multilevel  framework  used  to  identify  disparities  by  different  clusters  or subpopulations  among  US  counties.  This  study  is  highly  innovative  because  we  can  consider  more  a comprehensive  set  of to sociodemographic and economic factors by creating a novel dataset of Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER) linked dataset of Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) and the existing national cancer registry data of SEER. Longitudinal-based latent class growth models on trajectories in HPV-associated  cancer  risks  will  provide  an  effective  tool  to  identify  behavioral,  socioeconomic,  community,  and environmental factors (healthcare plan and providers) that lead to HPV-related cancer disparities in outcomes and their relative importance. Such findings will provide insight into the factors lead to better understanding why disparities are occurring, lead to designing and implementing effective interventions and changes in policies and healthcare coverage to reduce those disparities.   including  behavioral,  healthcare  providers  and  plans in  addition factors ",

FP00022335_Res1,175,,,,,1,,,"Sensorimotor control networks are the engines of action, including for speech and language. They have been argued to form the basis of working memory, modulate aspects of perception and comprehension, and when damaged have been linked to a range of language-related disorders including aphasia, apraxia of speech, dyslexia, and developmental stuttering. Visuomotor networks in the inferior parietal lobe have been extensively studied by multiple labs in several species and with a range of methods. In the visual domain, research and understanding has progressed to a point to enable translation into cognitive neural prosthetics (Andersen et al., 2010. Ann Rev Psych). If we could do the same for speech and language, the public health impact would be tremendous. Yet, far less is known about sensorimotor networks for speech, particularly regarding those in and around the planum temporale (PT) region, which significantly constrains the development of prosthetic and other treatment options. In this proposal, we will shine spotlights from multiple angles on this enigmatic and critically important cortical zone for speech and language function with the ultimate goal of developing truly game-changing therapeutic advances for the treatment of aphasia. Our approach is multi-pronged. We start with a novel hypothesis that there are at least two and probably three cortical auditory-motor circuits for speech/language production planning, one for laryngeal control, one for supralaryngeal control, both with hubs in the planum temporal region, and a higher-order (~lexical) circuit in the posterior parietal lobe. We then test this hypothesis (while mapping the broader circuits) using targeted fMRI studies (Aim 1), data-driven, large-scale functional and anatomical connectivity analyses (Aim 2), and lesion studies (Aim 3). AIM 1: Map auditory-motor circuits for speech production using targeted fMRI studies. We propose to use multiple paradigms to map auditory-motor speech/language circuits from converging perspectives. Altered auditory feedback paradigms allow us to target online auditory-motor error and correction signals directly for laryngeal (F0/pitch), supralaryngeal (F1/vowel), and in addition will study altered lexical-level feedback to test our prediction of posterior parietal involvement at this level. We also use a more standard listen-repeat paradigm but separate pitch from phonological components with representational similarity analysis. Finally, we use a novel model-based approach to mapping sub-abilities in speech production. We predict this work will identify subnetworks involved in auditory-motor vocal control.AIM 2: Delineate functional and anatomical connectivity networks. Human connectome data affords an opportunity to map cortical connectivity with unprecedented resolution. We use a novel analysis pipeline to identify connectivity patterns in and around the PT region and to test our hypothesis of the existence of multiple subnetworks, even within the PT. We then apply decoding analysis, using a meta-analysis of the functional activation literature, to attach functional significance to the networks we identify. The connectivity patterns we map, along with their decoded functions, will then be studied in relation to functional activation and lesion findings under the other Aims. AIM 3: Assess the causal involvement of auditory-motor circuits for speech using stroke. Finally, we use the lesion method to test our prediction that damage to the identified networks will cause deficits in a core set of abilities. We focus on feedback control using F1 shift, laryngeal control by developing our melody repetition and related tasks, and use data-driven analysis of speech and language ability in conduction aphasia to identify subtypes of sensorimotor deficits and their lesion correlates.",

If a small amount of hand-labeled training data is available corresponding to the class of interest and a large amount of unlabeled and unknown data is available, a semi-supervised learning algorithm called Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU Learning) can learn a model and label the unlabeled data automatically with high accuracy.   To learn models of ground combat vehicles, commercial vehicles, unmanned air systems, and so on, large amounts of labeled training data will be required.  PU learning can be used to gather large quantities of such data from existing datasets.  In addition to identifying and labeling model training data, PU learning techniques can be used in real-time classification of images as part of aided target recognition and classification.   Domain adaptation: Many signal processing and machine learning tasks require training data to learn the parameters of some underlying model. Most of the theoretical analyses and practical considerations in these applications are focused on scenarios where training and test data come from the same distribution. This may be justified in a number of small, controlled circumstances; however, in most applications, it is the case that, once deployed, these algorithms will encounter data similar to, but different from the training set. For example, consider an algorithm trained to classify between wheeled and non-wheeled vehicles using infrared (IR) imagery. Infrared image intensities will depend on generated heat from the engine, time of day, object surface properties, aspect angle, depression angle, range, etc. This results in a combinatorial explosion of potential signatures that can be encountered in real scenarios and it becomes impossible to expect that the training data will be representative of all possible future test data.  In this work, we propose to develop new algorithms for model adaptation based on a non-parametric estimator of data drift. In previous work, we derived a new bound on classification error that is based on a nonparametric probability distance measure that belongs to the family of f-divergences. In the context of binary classification, this new measure two appealing properties relative to this proposal: (1) there exists an asymptotically consistent estimator of the divergence measure that does not require density estimates of the two distributions; (2) it tightly bounds the minimum achievable error rate for the case where training and test data in the classification problem come from different distributions. We propose to track data drift using the non-parametric estimator by comparing the divergence between new incoming data and data previously used to train the model. Then iteratively labeling new samples in an active-learning framework to adapt the original trained model. ",
FP00022598,179,,,,,1,,,"Epilepsy is a common disorder in the United States (US) and globally that affects patients and caregivers health and quality of life. In the US, approximately 3.4 million people, or 1.2% of the population, are living with epilepsy; and the number is increasing. Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy face many challenges, and untreated epilepsy can result in poor health outcomes with potentially serious implications. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the essence of epilepsy treatment. Clinical guidelines recommend treating epilepsy as early as possible, but despite the availability of effective treatments, initiation of AEDs is often significantly delayed.In the US, one-third of newly diagnosed patients remain untreated up to 3 years after epilepsy diagnosis (Khalilani, 2019). This significant treatment gap increases the risk of medical events, ED visits and hospital admissions, however at this time there is limited research to explain the delay in AED initiation. Current thinking on population health would indicate that Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) may play a role in this critical gap in care. SDoH include factors such as ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomics, housing, physical environment, employment and health behaviors, as well as access to healthcare and the quality of care.There is limited research about the impact of SDoH on epilepsy and given the importance of these factors on health outcomes this represents a significant gap in knowledge for the epilepsy community. A recent study outlines a framework for evaluating how SDoH affect epilepsy care management and health outcomes (Slaflarski, 2014). This framework proposes several areas that would be addressable by UCB such as improving access to regular epilepsy care, improving patient/provider factors, medication adherence, changing health behaviors, and improving psychosocial support.To our knowledge, this project will provide the first substantial research looking at the correlation between SDoH and epilepsy outcomes, and the insights generated about AED treatment delay may influence strategies for improving health outcomes in the epilepsy population in Arizona and beyond.RESEARCH PROJECT DESCRIPTIONThe Research Project is estimated to take place over seven (7) consecutive months. The Research Project will encompass a scoping literature review, gathering of SDoH data at a census tract-level, development of a predictive statistical model, building of an interactive Geographic Information System map (GIS Map), statistical analyses, development of poster/s to be presented at relevant population health and epilepsy conferences, and preparation of a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.Initially a scoping literature review will be conducted by ASU to identify best practices regarding initiation of AED treatment, health outcomes related to AED treatment delays, and research on the implications of SDoH in epilepsy and other similar health conditions. At the completion of the literature review, a summary report will be developed.The Institutions CHiR team will develop a model that will relate the AED treatment gap for a patient with epilepsy with the SDoH at the census tract-level. The model will be built such that the relationships between SDoH and epilepsy treatment gaps can be quantified and examined in a study of census-tract level communities across Arizona (the Study). CHiR will develop a report describing the model and its use so it may be replicated in future studies.The following historical data will be gathered and included in the S     tudy:1.Existing Medicaid claims data from patients in Arizona with epilepsy are available from the years 2008 - 2017. This data will be used to determine the actual AED treatment gap for each patient and the census tract associated with the patients residential address.2.SDoH data at the census tract-level.

FP00022611,181,,,,,1,,," Statement of Work for: Changes in voice quality over time for Advanced Bionics SSD-CI patients M. Dorman, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona  Background: In a recent paper, we described the cochlear implant (CI) sound quality experienced by three Advanced Bionics (AB) single-sided deaf (SSD) patients who were fit with a CI (Dorman et al., in press, JSLHR). The patients were chosen for study because they had limited experience with their CI  less than 6 months  and because of the relatively short insertion depth of the AB electrode array.  To make the match to CI sound quality, all three patients need an upshift in formant frequencies (300 Hz - 800 Hz) and a metallic sound quality. Two of the three patients also needed an upshift in voice pitch (10  80 Hz) and a muffling of sound quality. These results are completely in keeping with the widely reported Mickey Mouse or Munchkin (from the movie The Wizard of Oz, 1939) voice quality that is very commonly reported for all devices shortly after device turn on.    Current proposal:  At issue in the proposed project is whether the Mickey Mouse voice quality changes over time and becomes, at 1 year post device activation, less upshifted in formant frequencies and/or pitch and becomes less metallic and muffled.  Time line = 1 year from start date. Design: We will bring back the 6 patients we have previously tested (we have tested 3 more since the Dorman et al. (in press) report, and retest them. We will obtain matches between the sound of the CI and signals presented to the normal hearing ear (which sounded upshifted in our original report). In addition, we will obtain data on a large number of tests of speech understanding and sound source localization.  ",

FP00022700,184,,,,,1,,,"Moving the Needle Forward in Health Disparities: An Education Initiative Project Summary Both trainees and medical staff at Mayo Clinic Arizona (MCA) have traditionally had remarkably limited exposure to underserved and/or vulnerable populations. Interwoven in this gap is a lack of understanding and appreciation of the impact of health disparities, social determinants, implicit bias and cultural humility of providers on patient health, healthcare seeking, trust in the healthcare system and willingness to participate in clinical trials. This health disparities initiative represents an innovative curricular program that aims to better prepare healthcare workers to deliver optimal care and develop patient rapport through a patient-centric approach to understand reflective of our societys rapidly shifting demographics.  This, in turn, will provide trainees and staff the tools necessary to recruit these patients to important clinical trials.The disparities and equity-based curriculum will include quarterly didactic lectures, online interactive modules and group discussions. Curricular and clinical efforts are interdependent and ultimately will provide the didactic and hands-on context needed to fully understand issues related to health disparities and treating socially, economically and culturally diverse patients. This program will be initially piloted to oncology providers and trainees in Arizona with the goal of broadening the program to include all oncology providers including nurses and midlevel providers at the tri-site level. We anticipate that this curriculum will be easily adapted within a variety of graduate medical education programs and provide critical continuing education for all current medical- and study staff members.Specific project aims and objectives:  Presently there is no formal training in healthcare disparities and equity, cultural humility, implicit bias or social determinants of health at the GME level or the CME level for medical and research staff at MCA. This area of study has become increasingly important in our era of healthcare delivery and is vastly under-recognized and under-appreciated. By contrast, the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine (MCSoM) has recognized the value in conveying this content knowledge to their medical students, formally designating these topics as mandatory curricular offerings. As part of MCSoMs partnership with Arizona State Universitys (ASU) College of Health Solutions, students are required to complete an 18-credit Certificate in the Science of Health Care Delivery program that includes coursework covering the social determinants of health, health disparities, health policy, and the role of physician leadership and advocacy to increase health equity. Notably, the program now also includes a course covering unconscious bias, which has recently been integrated into the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accreditation standards. Much of this content has been iteratively co-developed and delivered in the medical school classroom over the past two years at the MCSoM Arizona campus by ASUs Professor Swapna Reddy, JD, MPH. Beyond these curricular offerings, all MCSoM faculty and students are also required to read Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People and complete the Implicit Association Test (IAT) prior to the first day of medical school. In this way, MCSoM has demonstrated a commitment toward improving disparities based content in medical education, developing the core health equity competencies of both students and faculty and becoming a national leader in preparing future physicians to tackle some of these difficult issues.Unfortunately, this curriculum has not translated into the educational programs offered to our oncology investigators and staff (nor other post-graduate GME training) and, as such, a vital portion of education and clinical development are missing.  Many of our cancer center staff practice in or interact with communities of need from a wide array of socioeconomic and culturally diverse backgrounds. The ability to understand patients socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds, health literacy and other social determinants that impact their health will be vital for our trainees and staff to be able to give compassionate, comprehensive care to all patients as well as to establish relationships and rapport with patients to be able to recruit them into available studies. Aim 1 To establish a curriculum to provide oncology providers, trainees and allied medical/research staff with a foundational understanding of disparities in health and health care delivery, social determinants of health, implicit bias and cultural humility. Aim 2 To deliver a multi-modality curriculum through the use of quarterly didactic in-person lectures, online modules, group discussions and problem-based learning activities. Aim 3 To evaluate the efficacy and impact of the curriculum through the use of pre- and post- validated measures of specific clinical and personal competencies as well as online module assessments. Objectives: 1.To better understand the social, economic and systemic factors that contribute to health inequity in the U.S and locally;2.To identify how the lack of cultural humility and biases exacerbate disparities for vulnerable patient populations; 3.To demonstrate improved physician leadership skills; 4.To demonstrate improved cultural humility after having the opportunity to work with patients from different backgrounds;  5.To develop skills that improve quality and patient centered care.By way of these three Aims, this project effectively moves the needle forward on both health equity and GME/CME for Mayo Clinic Cancer Center providers, trainees and allied medical/research staff.  Significance of project:  Despite advances in medical science and education in the United States, significant health disparities persist. Social determinants of health including socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, access to care, language, health literacy, social capital, and trust in health systems play a significant role in the health outcomes of communities.1 In an attempt to make a significant impact in health equity, it is vital to understand how these determinants impact patients lives and contribute to their health. Additionally, physicians themselves must recognize and confront their own biases and need for cultural humility, not only to meet the social mission of medicine, but also in an effort to elevate the quality and responsiveness of care.2This initiative is critical for the education of medical staff providers, trainees and research staff at Mayo Clinic Cancer Center as it represents an innovative opportunity to gain both clinical and curricular education in an effort to better prepare them to provide high quality, patient-centered care and form relationships necessary for study recruitment. Description of the project:   A multi-platform, case-based curriculum will be formatted whereby online modules and in-person lectures will be delivered on the topics of health- and healthcare disparities, cultural humility, implicit bias and social determinants of health. Online modules will include multimedia tools such as interactive videos, lectures and assessments. In-person lectures will utilize didactic presentations, use of selected sections of the novel Blind Spot, group discussions and problem-based learning activities. This curriculum will be leveraging successful similar educational programs in medical education both at the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine and at a national level in medical education .3-5  Specifically, the content delivery would include four (4) quarterly iterative curricular sections that would include A.) a one hour lunch time interactive discussion and B.) a correlative case based multimedia online module. Topics for each section are: QuarterTopic General Description1Social Determinants of HealthWhat are social determinants of health? How do they impact the lives of patients and communities? How do they impact health outcomes? Why is it important for health care providers, researchers and systems to understand the social determinants of underrepresented communities? How can a deeper understanding of social determinants aid in recruitment and participation of underrepresented communities in clinical trials?Arizona-Based Case Study illustration.2Cultural Competency & HumilityWhat is cultural competency? What is cultural humility? What are the roles of each in the context of interacting with underrepresented communities? How do each impact the relationship between patient/community member and provider/researcher? How can improving cultural competency and humility build, improve and sustain trust between patients/community members and the scientific community? How can a deeper understanding of cultural competency and humility aid in the recruitment and participation of underrepresented communities in clinical trials?Arizona-Based Case Study3Health LiteracyWhat is health literacy? How does the concept impact patients and communities? How can health care providers/researchers/systems work with patients/community members to improve health literacy? How can a deeper understanding of health literacy aid in the recruitment and participation of underrepresented communities in clinical trials?U.S. Based Case Study4Unconscious Bias in Health CareWhat is unconscious bias? How does it differ from explicit bias? What is the impact of unconscious bias on patient outcomes, scientific research, providers and health systems? Effective interventions for unconscious bias in health care. How can a deeper understanding of unconscious bias aid in the recruitment and participation of underrepresented communities in clinical trials?IAT AdministrationU.S. Based Case StudyOnline Modules:  The online modules will include multimedia tools such as interactive videos, lectures and assessments. Online modules are intended to complement the in-person presentations and offer learners the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of each of the quarterly topics. To this end, each module will include: at least 2 thought piece topical articles, 1-2 short topical videos (news pieces, short documentary clips or recorded faculty discussions) to review, and a multiple choice quiz. All curricula components will, whenever possible, use cancer-related examples of disparities in health and screening. The overall online platform should include an optional discussion board on which learners can regularly post comments, articles, relevant current event clips, local lecture series, etc. for those interested to continue engagement throughout the four quarters.  Modules will be managed by Professor Reddy and her study manager. Modules will be delivered using Blackboard which is currently in use by the MCSoM.Literature supports that infusing this type of curriculum in the education of future health care providers leads to an improved patient-physician relationship, and consequently improved patient outcomes.6 The AMA has most recently attempted to recognize and address unconscious personal biases through a similarly-structured GME Competency Education Program. This program has worked to help physicians not only acknowledge their own susceptibility to implicit biases, but also practice evidence-based perspective-taking techniques through interactive modules. Development of a physicians cultural humility and management of biases are indispensable tools with which emerging education programs seek to equip the emerging workforce.6 Audience:  This curriculum will be widely available and applicable to all Cancer Center staff including GME trainees, medical and research staff. Specifically, all physicians, trainees and staff involved in MCCC clinical trials including consultant oncologists, radiation oncologists and consultants and trainees in medical, radiation and surgical oncology and gastroenterology will be recommended to participate in this program. These lectures will be recorded and also be available to those unable to attend in person using video-conferencing.  This will be piloted at the Arizona campus and thereafter if successful can be made available to trainees and staff at all three Mayo Clinic Cancer Center sites as well as could be made available to other institutions to facilitate their GME/CME curricula in healthcare disparities.Anticipated Outcomes: We expect participants to demonstrate an improved understanding of the factors that contribute to inequity in our healthcare system and to gain the tools necessary to address and overcome these factors with patients both as patient advocates and physician leaders.  All graduates of the program, those who successfully participate in all in-person/remote and online module offerings, will earn a Certificate in Health Care Disparities created and distributed by ASU College of Health Solutions.  Significance to Mayo Clinics Educational Mission:  As discussed above, we are committed to providing both trainees and staff with the highest level of training which will culminate in them becoming excellent clinical providers. We have identified a significant gap in both training and CME for both medical and research staff which, if filled, would round out their overall experiences and help them to be better providers. There is a significant portion of our population to whom our providers have minimal exposure on a routine basis and, hence, minimal understanding. Plan for evaluating the outcomes of the project:  We will be using multiple, validated instruments as well as pre- and post-lecture testing.  Participants will complete the Jefferson Scale of Empathy7, the CCCHP instrument  (Cross-Cultural Competence of Healthcare Professionals (CCCHP))8and the IAT 9-11 to assess providers cultural awareness and experience and preparedness with working with different cultures.  The Jefferson Scale of Empathy is a 20-item scale designed to assess empathy in healthcare professionals (Appendix A). The CCCHP is a 32-item self-reported scale which delivers a comprehensive assessment of health professionals cultural competence (Appendix B). The IAT is an online instrument developed by Harvard University used to help detect preferences or aversions to certain attributes and has been used to measure implicit bias in physicians.12 Paper questionnaires (CCCHP and Jefferson Scale of Empathy) will be completed before the first lecture (pre-) and after the last lecture (post).  These will be mandatory for all trainees attending the lectures and optional, but encouraged, for medical, nursing, midlevel and research staff. Time during the first lecture will be set aside to complete these brief instruments and they will be distributed and collected by Professor Reddy and her study manager/s who will be attending at the Phoenix location and from video conferenced location on the Scottsdale campus. The data will be collated and entered into a database formulated and managed by Professor Reddys team. The completion and analysis of these questionnaires also supports a robust research component to this project as we expect to glean valuable, publishable data from this experience.Program Deliverables:  The improvement in understanding of healthcare disparities will be evaluated at the end of each year and, partially, at the end of each lecture via pre- and post-lecture assessments. We anticipate an improvement in scores on all instruments indicating higher levels of cultural competency and empathy and lower levels of implicit bias and improved knowledge of the concepts as demonstrated by higher post-lecture scores. An annual report will be created collating assessment results, mapping of the process and identifying challenges as well as best practices to create scalable programs for future trainees as well as other GME and CME programs at MCA with similar gaps in knowledge and experience.",
FP00022733,185,,,,,1,,," PROJECT SUMMARY OVERVIEW:  SCH:INT: Smart and Connected Shoe for Ankle Injury Prevention PI: Hyunglae Lee, Co-PIs: Matthew Buman, Junseok Chae, and Sze Zheng Yong Lead Institution: Arizona State University  The proposed research/education activities explore unique approaches for ankle injury prevention using a smart  and  connected  shoe  system,  with  the  long-term  goal  of  preserving/promoting  ankle  health  and enhancing behavioral adherence to expert/clinical recommendations. Chronic ankle instability can lead to significant public health and financial burden, and current approaches (i.e., passive support from ankle taping, manual ankle braces) have limited utility due to constantly restricted ankle motion leading to muscle atrophy and sub-optimal adherence. This project seeks to study the unique smart and connected shoe system, using integrated scientific solutions of engineering, computation and behavioral science, to overcome these limitations and support enhanced user/patient care for individuals at risk of ankle injury. The smart and connected  shoe  system  is  equipped  with  Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System  (MEMS)-based  wireless sensors, an active ankle brace as well as prediction and control algorithms that provide assist-as-needed ankle support during challenging physical activities. In addition, the proposed system includes a mobile interface for providing feedback to the users/patients on their progress, use, and adherence to expert/clinical prescriptions. We will engage heavily throughout validation and evaluation phases of this project with clinical partners to ensure the system is tailored toward optimal clinical integration in mind, readying a prototype for clinical efficacy testing at the conclusion of this project. Therefore, the smart and connected shoe  broadly  targets  to  prevent  ankle  injury,  improve  health  outcomes,  and  reduce  healthcare  costs associated with this highly prevalent health concern. INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The proposed research pursues an integrated approach to substantially enhance the effectiveness of the current practice of passive ankle bracing or taping to reduce the risk of ankle injury during various physical activities. We propose to achieve improved injury prevention by designing a smart and connected shoe system with the capability of actively supporting the ankle as-needed and providing feedback to the target users on their adherence to risk-neutral gaits. The overarching goal will be accomplished by tackling the following scientific challenges: (i) accurate modeling of foot-ankle mechanics from in-situ data collected by wireless MEMS-based insole sensors, (ii) real-time likelihood prediction of ankle injury, (iii) integration of injury risk prediction and assist-as-needed control algorithms with a novel soft actuator design for ankle injury prevention, and (iv) delivery of an intuitive user interface that provides real-time and summative injury risk metrics to promote user adherence to ankle sprain prevention strategies. The proposed integration of wireless MEMS-based insole sensors and active stiffness-controlled actuators with biomechanics-based prediction and control algorithms provides a better scientific understanding of foot-ankle mechanics and their correlation to the risk of ankle injuries, and allows for continuous injury risk prediction and active support of ankle health in real time. The real-time data and predicted risk measure will be communicated via a mobile app that is designed based on behavioral studies and needs of users and clinical providers.  BROADER IMPACTS:  This research is impactful on many levels. On the scientific level, this research will benefit fundamental understanding of how active joint support via closed-loop assist-as-needed control improves the overall function of human users, such as athletes and soldiers, during various physical activities by improving ankle, knee or wrist stability and reducing the risk of injury without hindering performance nor contributing to potential muscle atrophy. In addition, gait/motion data of users can be acquired in natural settings, i.e., outside research or clinical labs, providing valuable data for better understanding the causes of ankle or other  joint  injuries.  On  the  societal  level,  continuous  assessment  and  injury  prevention  will  lead  to  a significant reduction of healthcare cost and may also translate to impacting rehabilitation of other motor impairments such as stroke. Examples of educational impact include new college-level course offerings on smart health and outreach to K-12 students, in particular women and minorities in engineering.  ",

The IHI Triple Aim framework was developed in 2007 by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Cambridge, Massachusetts (www.ihi.org). 2.Collaborate with key stakeholders across the HonorHealth organization and faculty researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) to identify and sustain ResQIPS projects. 3.Disseminate QI/research projects through local, national, and international venues. 4.Partner with internal and external stakeholders to develop innovative educational pathways to meet the needs of our learners and the communities we serve. Fig. 1. Principles of health systems scienceProposal: Develop Informational Podcasts targeting residents, fellows, and clinical faculty at HonorHealth, 2020Rationale: The efforts to train physicians to excel in the current and future health care landscape, it is pivotal to provide learning resources beyond those just clinical in nature. In order to achieve the Triple Aim, physicians must demonstrate proficiency in  clinical care, but also issues impacting the larger health care system in which they will practice. Physicians must have easy access to current, evidence-based, and relevant information, engage with high priority health systems topics, and critically consider challenges in our health care system. The goal is to not only train clinically excellent physicians of the future, but also physician leaders who can improve practice and outcomes for health care organizations, patients and communities. We propose funding the development of an exclusive 8-part podcast series intended for our residents, fellows, and clinical faculty with the explicit goal of creating accessible, dynamic and relevant deliverables that inform but also engage. Due to the various locations of our trainees, podcasts are ideal (and familiar) forms of media that can be broadly accessed from virtually anywhere, at any time. To create content that is not only engaging but also evidence-based, we will collaborate with a team of clinical expert faculty at Arizona State University (ASU). The ASU team has a history of crafting popular, relevant and high-quality programming on some of the toughest topics in health care, aptly named We Need to Talk-Tough Conversations in Health Care.In the proposed partnership, the ASU team would collaborate with key stakeholders at HonorHealth, including clinical experts, residents and fellows, to produce six original podcasts delivered every two months in the 2020 calendar year focused on high priority health care topics. Each podcast would consist of background information on the topic, interviews with experts, and an engaging interprofessional discussion. Topics based on principles of health systems science and built from Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) program priority areas. The production of high-quality podcasts would require podcast quality sound equipment, editing, and an experienced podcast producer. Furthermore, these podcasts could incorporate a closed, social media platform where learners could safely discuss ideas, engage in interprofessional dialogue, share articles, thought pieces and events relevant to the topics. (figure 2). Outcomes: ASU faculty experts (Swapna Reddy, JD, MPH; Gregory Mayer, MD; Adrienne White, MS) in collaboration with experts from within the HonorHealth system will deliver a 6-part, evidence-based podcast series for residents, fellows, and clinical faculty. HonorHealth will investigate CME opportunities through HonorHealth Library Services.",
FP00022871,187,,,,,1,,,"     Abstract_Maupome_draft 042920.docx Title: Factors involved in added sugar intake among Hispanics: A social influence approach to understanding its relationship with negative dental caries outcomes.  SPECIFIC AIMS We propose the use of network science methods to characterize added sugar intake among Hispanics, and to delineate determinants of dietary patterns, in the context of negative dental caries outcomes. While we know that dietary patterns generally deteriorate upon migration to the U.S.A, it is not well established how specific mechanisms of shifting dietary patterns affect Hispanics. There are multiple factors influencing dietary custom modification. Hispanics consume many foods and drinks that often add to their sugar intake: their quantification is difficult because food and drink choices adopted in the U.S.A. are superimposed on those from the country of origin. The net effect of added sugar on dental health is deleterious for high dental caries experience (tooth decay) across countries of origin, socio-demographic background, acculturation level, and skill level for navigating the health care system.  Dietary evaluations for dental health tailored for the Hispanic population have yet to be developed. Existing work focuses disproportionately on individual level factors. Community and personal network variables related to dietary health among Hispanic individuals are largely understudied. Network variables have distinct roles on health experiences and are necessary to gain a more complete perspective of dental health because they will help understand dietary patterns and dental health behaviors. Our long-term goal is to better characterize factors associated with the role and context of added sugar intake among Hispanics, leading to an interpretation that is sufficiently complete and actionable to inform clinical and policy decisions. Our central hypothesis is that social influence through personal and community networks modify effects of added sugar intake on negative dental experiences linked to dental caries. Our specific aims are to:  Aim 1. Develop surveys to ascertain added sugar intake and social influence among 1st and 2nd+ generation Hispanic immigrants.  Aim 2. Characterize network-level and individual-level factors associated with negative dental experiences (e.g., dental pain, prescription of medications for dental reasons).  Aim 3. Determine relationships between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, and norms and resources, to quantify the association of added sugar intake with negative dental experiences.  Our research strategy will afford a precise interpretation of the context of those dental experiences associated with caries; it will contribute to tailoring preventive interventions and health promotion programs to Hispanics socio-cultural profiles. We will add to the objective methods that inform, e.g., clinical criteria to manage caries, and to, e.g., the values driving public health campaigns that incorporate multi-level perspectives. Scope of Work   Dr. Vega-Lpez, PI at Arizona State University, will oversee all study-related activities in Arizona, including implementation, recruitment, data collection, data management, and coordination with the team and Indiana University.

Our central hypothesis is that social influence through personal and community networks modify effects of added sugar intake on negative dental experiences linked to dental caries. Our specific aims are to:  Aim 1. Develop surveys to ascertain added sugar intake and social influence among 1st and 2nd+ generation Hispanic immigrants.  Aim 2. Characterize network-level and individual-level factors associated with negative dental experiences (e.g., dental pain, prescription of medications for dental reasons).  Aim 3. Determine relationships between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, and norms and resources, to quantify the association of added sugar intake with negative dental experiences.  Our research strategy will afford a precise interpretation of the context of those dental experiences associated with caries; it will contribute to tailoring preventive interventions and health promotion programs to Hispanics socio-cultural profiles. We will add to the objective methods that inform, e.g., clinical criteria to manage caries, and to, e.g., the values driving public health campaigns that incorporate multi-level perspectives.",
FP00022926,189,,,,,1,,,"STATEMENT OF WORK I.Background: INMIND is a novel pilot intervention that addresses the significant problem of poor long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and lack of viral suppression among HIV-infected patients initiating ART treatment. This research project will be implemented in an HIV clinic in Uganda in a 12-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of two different methods for supporting the formation of daily ART adherence routines. Participants in the first intervention group (n=50) will receive advice on how to anchor healthy pill-taking to an existing behavioral routine in combination with daily SMS messages reminding participants of this behavioral strategy for 90 days (Message group). In a second intervention group, participants (n=50) will receive that same information and messages but in addition have the chance of winning small monetary rewards conditional on taking ART medications at approximately the same time as their pre-specified existing behavioral routine (Incentive group). Adherence will be measured for the 9 months following the 3-month intervention, and viral load will be taken at baseline and month 12. The control group (n=50) will receive the usual standard of care, along with the same educational materials regarding the value of daily routines and anchoring ART adherence to an existing routine. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, month 3 (end of the intervention), and month 12.II.Specific Aims: The Specific Aims are to:SA1. Formative Phase 1: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of INMIND. Elicit reactions to the intervention, preferences for behavioral routine information, and feedback on incentives and other intervention design parameters to finalize intervention development in preparation for Phase 2.  SA2a. Intervention Phase 2: Test the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention, including the relative effectiveness of two different implementation approaches. The main hypothesis is: reminder text messages are more effective for anchoring ART adherence to an existing routine than providing one-off information. The secondary hypothesis is: adding incentives to the information-reinforcing messages is more effective for supporting persistent ART medication adherence. SA2b. Intervention Phase 2: Test the intervention effectiveness on secondary outcomes. Evaluate the main and secondary hypotheses as outlined in SA2a in terms of the secondary outcomes: self-reported medication adherence, retention in care, and viral suppression. SA3. Adaptation Phase 3: Collect data informing intervention parameters for a subsequent fully-powered R01 application. III.Services to be Performed: Co-I Chad Stecher will assist PI Sebastian Linnemayr with all stages of this proposed research. This includes the design and construction of the survey instruments, educational materials, and SMS reminder notifications (Message group), as well as the administration of baseline, month 3, and month 12 assessments and the analysis of all study data. In addition, Dr. Stecher will assist in the dissemination of the research findings through oral presentations at public health and behavioral economics conferences, and by preparing manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Specifically, Dr. Stecher will provide the behavioral economics theoretical modeling and parameterization based on the behavioral data collected in this pilot study.",

FP00022955,191,,,,,1,,,"African American women experience a high burden of cardiometabolic disease conditions. Fifty-five percent are obese, 57% have cardiovascular disease, and 13% have diagnosed diabetes. Engaging in regular aerobic physical activity is an established mechanism to prevent and manage these cardiometabolic diseases. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of three physical activity interventions to increase physical activity and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among sedentary and overweight/obese African American women. In a 12 month randomized trial, 240 African American women will be assigned to one of three intervention groups for an active 4-month intervention period followed by an 8-month minimal contact follow-up: a) Smart Walk, b) Smart Walk + Enhanced Social Support, or c) Fitbit-only comparison arm. The Smart Walk intervention group will receive a culturally relevant smartphone-based physical activity intervention previously developed and tested by our research team. This intervention is primarily delivered through our Smart Walk smartphone application, which includes four key features: 1) personal profile pages, 2) culturally relevant multi-media (i.e., text and video) PA promotion modules, 3) message/discussion boards, and 4) PA self-monitoring/tracking feature that integrates with Fitbit activity monitors for participants to track their daily, weekly, and monthly activity. Smart Walk participants also receive three PA promotion text messages each week for the duration of the active 4-month intervention. The Smart Walk + Enhanced Social Support intervention group will receive the Smart Walk intervention and be assigned a physical activity promotion coach to reinforce Smart Walk intervention content through one-on-one physical activity coaching and by facilitating small group-based (i.e., 2-3 participants) weekly walking sessions among participants. The Fitbit-only arm comparison arm will receive a Fitbit activity monitor and be encouraged to use the commercially available device to increase physical activity. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4-months, and 12 months. We hypothesize the Smart Walk and Smart Walk + Enhanced Social Support groups will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in physical activity and cardiometabolic risk factors when compared to the Fitbit-only comparison group, with the Smart Walk + Enhanced Social Support group demonstrating greatest improvements. Behavioral outcome measures will include accelerometer-measured and self-reported changes in physical activity. Physiological outcomes include traditional risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (i.e., BMI, blood pressure, serum lipid profiles, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance), and more novel and prognostic risk factors, including cardiorespiratory fitness, aortic pulse wave velocity, and pro-inflammation biomarkers (TNF-a, IL-1). Additionally, we will explore mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness and determine the total societal cost per participant of delivering each intervention and the cost-effectiveness of the interventions to increase minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.",
FP00022966,192,,,,,1,,,"Abstract The Mind the Gap project will address the national substance abuse treatment gap via rapid preservice education of 500 healthcare and behavioral healthcare students across the Arizona university system. Despite the prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs), mainstream healthcare education is currently inadequate in preparing future practitioners to provide high quality services to individuals and families suffering from SUDs. The overarching goal of this project is to equip future providers by enhancing, disseminating, implementing, and evaluating SUD-related curricula across multiple health and behavioral health programs at Arizona State University (ASU) and Northern Arizona University (NAU). The project team has secured partnerships with NAUs Physician Assistant program and ASUs Healthy Lifestyles Coaching program and the Health Education and Health Promotion program. These programs presently include only limited curricula related to SUDs. We will also expand content on SUD-related specialty topics in ASUs Addiction and Substance Use-Related Disorders online graduate certificate program, the Doctor of Nursing program, and the Doctor of Behavioral Health program. This grant will support the development and delivery of new training content for undergraduate and graduate students. We will enhance existing curricula by developing new modules in SUD assessment and treatment strategies and by expanding student access via an online learning portal (Canvas). We will incorporate and build upon our existing, comprehensive Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) curriculafunded through the SAMHSA SBIRT Student Training Grantand our existing specialty topic curricula (e.g., medication-assisted treatment and Motivational Interviewing). We will use a quality improvement approach to iteratively evaluate, improve, and disseminate the enhanced curricula. We will then work with licensing and certification boards overseeing the participating programs to implement questions related to SUDs in certification examinations. Our project objectives are to (1) expose a minimum of 500 students to best practices for SUDs screening and interventions by implementing curricula across six health and behavioral health disciplines within two universities over the course of two years; (2) ensure student mastery of SUDs content through average scores of 80% or higher on post-training knowledge assessments; (3) establish a student course satisfaction rate of 85% or higher through the continued adaptation and enhancement of learning materials; (4) ensure the transfer of SUDs best practice from the university classroom to post-graduation practice settings through an implementation rate of 60% or higher for new graduates; and (5) sustain SUDs curricula content in 85% of participating programs. These project objectives will create a more comprehensive and robust curricula and will increase access to SUDS training, which will, in turn, increase patient access to evidence-based interventions for risky substance use in the southwest region of the United States.

FP00022976,193,,,,,1,,,"Abstract Despite clear and convincing evidence for the efficacy of preventive interventions in preventing substance use and abuse (SU/A), the public health impact of these programs has been limited by inadequate uptake in community settings. This application seeks to train 3 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral fellows annually to conduct research that reduces the gap between real-world practice and evidence-based preventive interventions targeting SU/A. The proposed background is a renewal of our current NIDA-funded T32 (currently in Year 5) and builds on a lengthy and successful 33-year history of T32 training that has been funded by NIMH from 1987-2014 and NIDA from 2014-present. Our training program is informed by the translational research cycle and Chambers and Proctors recommendations on training for early career Dissemination & Implementation (D&I) researchers. The training is housed at ASUs REACH Institute, and participating units include the Arizona State University (ASU) Department of Psychology and School for Social and Family Dynamics. The interdisciplinary training faculty will be drawn from these units, as well as existing collaborators from College of Health Solutions, W.P. Carey Colleges of Business, Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation, Fulton Schools of Engineering, Hugh Downs School of Human Communications, School of Criminology and Social Justice, and the School of Social Work. Training faculty conduct numerous NIH-funded projects in which collaborative research teams design, implement, and evaluate theory-based preventive interventions in natural service delivery settings and study the implementation science questions related to successful program uptake. Training faculty have unique strengths in SU/A prevention, D&I, culture and health disparities, and research methodology (particularly quantitative methods). The program is guided by an External Training Faculty of national experts in implementation science and a Community Advisory Board composed of decision leaders from service delivery settings (schools, courts, health care, and mental health care settings), with whom we partner on community-based research projects. Training consists of mentored research apprenticeships, an ongoing training seminar (including training in ethics and career development), required courses in SU/A and D&I, and other relevant experiences based on Individualized Training Plans that will be co-created with mentors. Through this tailored combination of coursework and research apprenticeships, trainees acquire skills in designing interventions for implementation, models of cultural adaptation, technology-based interventions, community-based participatory research, implementation theory and design, organizational characteristics, and economic analysis. The research contributions of our trainees will increase the adoption of evidence-based interventions in real world practice, helping to realize their public health impact at the population level. ",
FP00022985,194,,,,,1,,,"Scientific audience abstract  There  is  growing  evidence  showing  that  the  gut  microbiome  is  a  critical  modulator  in  type  1 diabetes  (T1D)  predisposition  and  pathogenesis.  Compositional  differences  of  gut  microbiota have been reported in T1D patients compared with healthy controls. Understanding the functional implications of the taxonomical changes and the establishment of the causal relationship between microbiota and T1D are the foci of much current research. T1D is a chronic autoimmune disease, with both humoral and cellular aspects, and the gut is the largest immune organ in the body. The growing  evidence  of  the  crosstalk  between  the  gut  microbiome  and  the  immune  system, especially during the early years of human development, suggests that immune responses to microbiota impact autoimmunity. We propose to compare anti-bacteria antibody (ABAb) profiles between  T1D  patients  and  healthy  controls.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  a  global  comparison  of antibody  responses  to  bacterial  proteins  will  complement  other  compositional  and  functional studies and inform the role of the gut microbiome in T1D development and its potential utility in T1D risk assessment and clinical management.  The proposed study will be implemented by a team of scientists at Arizona State University Biodesign Institute and University of Florida Diabetes Institute that leverages more than 10 years of  productive  collaboration  between  immunoproteomics  experts,  immunologists,  diabetes clinicians and medical researchers. We will produce bacterial antigen arrays displaying ~5,000 proteins from ~50 different bacteria with rigorous quality control using our innovative nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) technology. We will probe bacterial NAPPA with serum samples  from  new-onset  T1D  patients  and  age-gender  matched  healthy  controls.  Human leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  types,  together  with  other  clinical  parameters,  are  available  for  all subjects. We will detect ABAbs using fluorescent labelled anti-human IgG and IgA antibodies, and compare sero-reactivity differences between T1D patients and controls at the bacteria and individual  proteins  levels.  We  will  analyze  the  association  between  ABAbs  with  HLA  types, autoantibodies and other parameters. Additionally, we will apply machine learning techniques to identify the best combination of ABAbs for classifying T1D patients from healthy controls. We envision this project will provide new insights in the connection between bacteria and T1D and guide future studies using longitudinal samples and higher content arrays.  Lay audience abstract 1.  General Audience Summary In health, humans carry 39 trillion bacteria in our bodies, a little more than the number of our  own  cells.  There  is  growing  evidence  that  these  numerous  passengers,  their composition, byproducts, and behaviors, play an important role in maintaining health and promoting  disease.  The  aim  of  this  proposal  is  to  explore  the  role  of  bacteria  in  the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D).  Previous studies on the connection between T1D and microorganisms focused on viruses. There is growing interest in understanding the bacterial link to T1D. Often when bacteria interact with their hosts, they cause the host immune system to produce antibodies against the bacterias proteins.  This event acts as a sort of molecular graffiti to show scientists that a bacterium was here. The more detail we  can  read  from  this  graffiti,  about  which  bacteria  were  present  and  which  bacterial proteins triggered the response, the more we can learn about how these bacteria may affect  T1D.    Limited  by  simpler  technologies,  previous  studies  could  only  look  at  one protein  per  bacterium  (each  bacteria  has  thousands)  or  a  mix  of  all  proteins  blended together.  Moreover,  earlier  studies  typically  looked  at  less  than  a  handful  of  different bacteria at a time.  We have developed a new technology, called protein microarrays, that will allow us read this molecular graffiti from thousands of different proteins and many different bacteria.  We propose to construct a protein microarray which displays thousands of  bacterial  proteins  from  commensal  and  pathogenic  bacteria.    Serum  samples  from either T1D patients or healthy controls will be screened for the presence of antibodies to bacterial proteins. We will compare anti-bacteria antibodies between T1D and controls at the individual bacterial antigen level and at the individual bacterium level. We will also analyze  association  between  anti-bacterial  antibodies  and levels  of  major autoantibodies, HLA types, age, gender and  other clinical parameters. The successful execution of this proposal will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between bacteria and the development of T1D at a depth and breadth that has not been explored before. the 2.  Technical Abstract See page 1.  3.  Objective The objective of this proposal is to explore the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of T1D from the perspective of T1D specific anti-bacterial antibody responses by profiling serum antibodies  against  thousands  of  bacterial  proteins  from  dozens  of  different  bacteria displayed our innovative protein array platform. 4.  Background/Rationale Environmental factors such as nutrients, microbial infection contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D.   Much focus has been put on the role of viral infection in the development of T1D.  However, with the advancement DNA sequencing technology, the role of bacteria in health and disease including T1D has been increasingly appreciated. Currently, studies of the connection between bacteria and diseases rely heavily on  the sequencing of bacterial 16sRNA  or  genes  in  biological  samples.  While  useful,  the  presence  of  a  bacterial sequence only indicates the presence of a bacterium at the time of sample collection but cannot indicate if the bacterium interacted with the host and will not provide information about bacteria occupancy in the past. We propose a different approach using anti-bacterial antibodies. Antibodies provide complementary information to next generation sequencing, including  infection  history,  gut  mucosal  integrity,  gut  mucosal  immune  system  status, molecular  mimicry  between  bacterial  antigens  and  autoantigens,  interaction  between environment and gene. Longitudinal studies together with immunoglobulin subtypes may provide  event  timelines.  Antibodies  to  individual  bacterial  antigens  can  provide  more information than the overall infection status.  There is no prior study on immune responses to many bacteria at the individual protein level in T1D patients.  By comparing the anti-bacterial antibody profiles between T1D and healthy  controls,  together  with  levels  of  T1D major  autoantibodies,  genetics  related  to antibody production, age, gender and other clinical information, we hope to contribute to our understanding of the bacterial link to T1D.  5.  Anticipated Outcome Our proposal is designed to employ a protein array platform to study antibody immune responses  against  thousands  of  proteins  encoded  by  many  different  human  bacteria simultaneously in T1D patients.  Such a systematic study will not only provide a complete picture  of  bacterial  infection  in  T1D  patients  but  also  offer  detailed  information  on  the importance of immune responses to multiple different proteins in bacterial proteomes to T1D development. 6.  Relevance to Type 1 Diabetes It is well established that T1D is a disease with autoimmune destruction of pancreatic  cells, but the underlining mechanism of how this autoimmune process initiated is still not fully understood.  A consensus points to an important role of for environmental factors.  Among  such  factors,  the  human  microbiome,  including  its  composition,  metabolite production and effect on food processing, has attracted growing interest in relation to T1D.  Yet,  despite  the  potential  impact  of  this  large  aspect  of  our  physiology,  our  current understanding is limited.  Among the missing pieces, we need to understand better, which microorganisms interact with the host to produce a response, both currently and in the past,  and  which  bacterial  proteins  in  particular  trigger  such  a  response.    Given  the importance of immune function in the etiology of T1D, it is highly relevant to document the difference in the immune responses to the microbiome between T1D patients and controls. This  study  focuses  on  the  immune  response  to  bacterial  proteins  This  study  is  highly relevant  to  T1D  research  because  it  will  promote  our  understanding  of  underlying molecular  mechanism(s)  for  how  certain  bacterial  infections  can  contribute  to  the development of T1D.  The identification of causal bacteria and / or their immunodominant antigens  may  facilitate  research  on  the  feasibility  of  vaccination  or  other  microbiome modulation strategies in preventing T1D.

FP00023054,195,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Latino youth are a population at risk for chronic diseases because of their growing overweight and obesity rates, lack of adherence to nutrition and physical activity recommendations, and greater rates of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs use than youth of other ethnic groups. Parents are an important agent of change for youth due to their ability to create a home environment that promotes healthful behaviors (including substance use prevention and healthy nutrition), and parents role as providers of resources to the family (including food). Parenting interventions are efficacious in preventing substance use among Latino youth, but few studies have used a family approach to promote healthy nutrition. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed project is to extend the scope of Families Preparing the New Generation (FPNG), an existing parenting program proven to help reduce substance use among Latino youth, to also promote healthy nutrition. The ecodevelopmental perspective will provide the theoretical foundation for the project for investigating risk and resiliency in Latino youths drug use and nutrition behaviors. Our main aims are to (1) test the effects of a nutrition-enhanced parenting program (FPNG+) on substance use and nutrition among Latino youth, (2) explore how enhancing parenting skills impact the effects of the enhanced intervention, and (3) understand how social and cultural factors impact how the enhanced program works. We will first seek input from community members to create a nutrition-enhanced program that is acceptable to Latino parents of middle school students. We will then collaborate with the American Dream Academy (ADA), an organization delivering an academic success program to families within middle schools throughout the Phoenix Area, to recruit 1,494 families who have a student in 7th grade to participate in the study. Parents from different schools will be offered one of three 10-week programs (assigned to each individual school): FPNG+ (substance use prevention and healthy nutrition), FPNG (substance use prevention only), and the ADA comparison program (focusing on academic success). We will collect data from the 7th grade student and his/her participating parent before the start of the program, immediately after it ends, and 16 weeks later, to compare how the programs affect nutrition, substance use, and parenting. In a subgroup of 126 families (42 from each program), we will explore how the FPNG+ program affects diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors and whether the program induces changes in the types of foods available at participants homes. For this, we will collect capillary blood samples from participants to measure glycosylated hemoglobin (a marker of diabetes risk) and cholesterol (a marker of cardiovascular risk), and blood pressure, as well as a list of foods that participants have at home. Our long-term goal is to design and disseminate programs that contribute to helping parents assist their adolescent children develop and maintain long-lasting positive lifestyle behaviors in order to prevent substance use and chronic diseases.

FP00023060,196,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary     With over 50 million cases worldwide, dengue virus infection is the most prevalent Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) affecting low-income populations of tropical countries. Case reports for dengue and other NTDs are based primarily on a passive surveillance system with limited coverage in rural communities, leading to significant delays and underrepresentation of the number of cases. It is not until the end or after the season that the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reports are updated to reflect more realistic NTD estimates. These limitations greatly impede epidemiology efforts to curb NTD epidemics, including key tasks like identification of the (initial) index cases, identification of geographic areas at risk, and transmission clusters propagating the outbreak. Capitalizing on separately funded work by MPI Gonzalez-Hernandez on social media mining (R01LM011176), MPI Mubayis and MPI Soctchs NSF-funded work on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and MPI Scotchs work on data-driven approaches to studying infectious diseases (R01LM012080), as well as joint work on incorporating geographic location data extracted from full text for (R01AI117011), the goal of this project is to address challenges of NTD surveillance, particularly reporting lag and limited coverage through the use of alternative data sources from the affected regions, including social media -Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, Google search logs, and cell phone and internet connection data. To validate and calibrate the proposed data frame, we will deploy regional teams in the Andes (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru) for mosquito surveillance. To this end, Aim 1 seeks to develop and evaluate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to mine social media and search data, including annotation of gold standards and development of methods for collection extraction, and classification of publicly available social media data that directly mentions a diagnosis of dengue, and the automatic determination of place of residence from the users posts and metadata, thus establishing our capacity of automatically finding cohorts of residents of the Andes that report cases of dengue. Aim 2 seeks to validate the use of these data for epidemiological surveillance models and estimating underreporting of dengue virus in the Andes through comparative analysis of the NLP extracted data to official post-season data from the PAHO and from individual countries public health departments for the same locations. Aim 3 seeks to develop and evaluate a meta-population epidemic model to quantify the spatial distribution of transmission risk per country, to estimate the state specific transmission rate and prevalence of dengue virus using adjusted incidence (for underreporting) derived from data produced in Aim 1, and create a web-site for researchers to access our models and data as it is produced. If successful, the framework we propose could address the delays and lack of coverage of traditional surveillance methods for dengue in the Andean region, has the potential to scale to other NTDs in Latin America and, when other languages are incorporated, other NTDs around the world.

FP00023104,199,,,,,1,,," NRT: Innovation Centric Training in Sensors and Machine Learning (SensMACH) for Health Monitoring Applications  Overview:  The  proposed  NRT  will  produce  graduates  poised  to  innovate  and  lead  the  development  of  next generation  sensor  and  machine  learning  algorithms,  and  software  for  mobile  health  and  IoT  systems.  The program  is  based  on  the  premise  that  next  generation  health  monitoring  technologies  and  standards  targeting disease prevention will reduce health care cost. Sensing and cloud computing capabilities of mobile platforms are  creating  game  changing  environments  for  innovation  in  health  applications.  A  significant  drawback  is  the lack of precision in emerging off-the-shelf mobile health products and apps. Advances in synergistic sensor and algorithm design are key to improving precision in mobile health analytics.  This Interdisciplinary Traineeship Track NRT will train students in Sensors and Machine Learning (SensMACH) for Intelligent Health and IoT Systems. SensMACH will enable predictive diagnostics for prevention of diseases. Training students to innovate and advance monitoring technologies requires understanding of challenges at the overlap of sensor design, big data,  machine  learning,  biomedical  information  management,  and  associated  social  implications  and  policies. This  gender  and  culturally  diverse    NRT  team  includes  distinguished  fellows,  faculty  leaders  and  CAREER award  winners  who  lead  major  centers  in  sensors,  circuits,  signal  processing,  brain  studies,  engineering education and social sciences. Multidisciplinary plans of study along with unique innovation centric laboratory sequence  that  includes  creating  prototypes  in  our  NRTs  Sensor  Innovation  Studio  enable  our  graduates  to invent and patent new sensors and monitoring systems.  The total number of trainees to receive a NRT stipend will be 28. The number of students not receiving a stipend will be 30 for a grand total of 68 NRT trainees. The program will serve both Masters and Doctoral students.  Intellectual Merit: Inexpensive sensors are required for mobile health monitoring and IoT systems. To improve precision and analytics, sensor design must be accompanied by an array of corrective algorithms. This requires integrative  multidisciplinary  research  that  bridges  the  gap  between  sensor  design  and  machine  learning algorithm development. This innovation-centric NRT will train sensor designers that also understand algorithm capabilities  and  produce  algorithm  developers  with  knowledge  on    on  sensor  design  challenges.  A  modular interdisciplinary  plan  will  prepare  Masters  and  Doctoral  students  for  industry,  academic,  and  entrepreneurial careers.  Preparing  such  a  workforce  requires  establishing  multidisciplinary  plans  of  study  with  a  variety  of student  pathways  for  success  that  span  technology  (science,  brain  analytics,  engineering),  diagnostics  (DSP, informatics, big data), innovation education (patents, prototypes)  and policy (social implications, privacy), with an  overarching  emphasis  on  leadership,  innovation  and  entrepreneurship.  Ultimately,  the  NRT  program  will enable  mobile  systems  for  personalized  diagnostics  to  incentivize  healthy  behavior.  NRT  dissertation  topics include:  a)  integrated  sensor  device  and  machine  learning  b)  big  data  and    information  fusion,  c)  biomedical information management, d) flexible circuits and sensor parches, e) mobile brain analytics, and f) cross-cutting topics in standards, social implications and policy.  Broader Impacts: The NRT program will provide solutions that will impact major smart city IoT projects.  The NRT  includes  global  research  experiences,  crosscutting  modules,  and  seminars  in:  public  speaking,  policy, standards, ethics, patents, SBIR planning, and outreach.  The SensMACH team  will create an NRT certificate with the long term plan to eventually establish an institute with a sustainable degree program.

FP00023105,200,,,,,1,,,"Mutations in the histone lysine N-methyltransferase SETD2 are associated with loss of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), transcriptional alterations, global DNA hypermethylation, and clinically a 3-fold higher risk of metastases and decreased survival. We recently found that loss of SETD2 induces a metabolic switch in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines toward enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. However, a limitation of this published study is that it did not address fatty acid oxidation. To address this fundamental gap prior to future clinical applications, we hypothesize that SETD2 dysregulation modifies the RCC phenotype by inducing a distinct metabolic reprogramming of key regulators such as PGC-1a or CPT1A that control the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, respectively. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will identify metabolic alterations in the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, comparing isogenic SETD2 cell line pairs (KO and wild-type) in 3D culture. In Aim 2, we will examine metabolic changes of the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism due to SETD2 dysregulation in immunocompetent murine RENCA models. The intended outcome of these multidisciplinary studies will be both an improved understanding, at the molecular level, of SETD2 mutations on tumor metabolism and, at the translational level, a unique opportunity to identify pathways that SETD2 mutant tumors may be more susceptible to. More importantly, completion of these studies may identify potential drug targets for metastases in a broad range of human cancers with similar SETD2 alteration.",
FP00023110,201,,,,,1,,,"More than 630,000 people died due to drug overdose in the U.S. between 1999 and 2016. 1 The majority of patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) do not receive treatment.2 The majority of opioids are obtained through a physicians prescription, yet fewer than 7% of patients access treatment for OUD through their physician.2 While buprenorphine has been shown to be highly efficacious management, most primarycare physicians are either not waivered to prescribe it, or if they are waivered, are reluctant to prescribe it.2,3 Educational gaps and persistent stigma toward patients with OUD remain among current and future physicians.4,5 Overarching challenges include the shortfall of addiction medicine physicians and lack of coordination between primary care and behavioral health. Patients bear the burden of additional challenges.Disparities exist in access to treatment, satisfaction with treatment efficacy, and treatment completion.6 Patients with OUD also report negative experiences with provider communication in the primary care setting.7The Project ECHO model: The ECHO model connects local primary care clinicians with specialist teams at academic medical centers in virtual clinics to increase provider capacity, reduce waste, reduce hospitalizations and emergency department use, decrease adverse medical events, and improve patient function. 8 The Project ECHO model has been used successfully in the screening, diagnosis, and managementof patients with OUD. 9,10 Goal. Establish a state-wide collaborative partnership to scale education and practice in the management of patients with OUD through Project ECHO  a model that uses technology to leverage expertise of the multidisciplinary team; share best practices to standardize evidence-based care; leverage case-basedlearning and guided practice to master complex cases; and apply web-based tools to monitor outcomes. Objectives.1) Develop and implement a web-based, CE/CME  bearing, interprofessional curriculum on management of complex patients with chronic pain and identification and management of OUD that serves resident, fellow, and clinician populations in outpatient and inpatient settings.2) Increase the capacity of clinicians in primary care to better diagnose, manage, and treat patients with OUD.3) Increase the knowledge and self-efficacy of clinicians in primary care to manage complex patients with chronic pain and OUD.Community partners. HonorHealth is comprised of five magnet hospitals, five urgent care sites, 23 NCQA recognized PCMH locations, an affiliated Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), an emergency center, an acute rehabilitation hospital, and over 100 outpatient sites. The hospitals in the network are major teachinghospitals with residency programs in General Surgery, Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Dermatology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R), and fellowships in Addiction Medicine and Cardiovascular Disease. The HonorHealth Addiction Medicine Fellowship received ACGME accreditation in 2018, addressing a critical gap in the physician workforce. Fellows complete their training at Community Bridges, Inc. (CBI), providing comprehensive, medically integrated behavioral health care to underserved and complex patient populations in Arizona, including children and adolescents, women, and patients with severe mental illness (SMI). Proof of concept. HonorHealth developed a multi-level network opioid stewardship initiative aligned with state and national priorities in education and quality improvement (QI). Leadership and clinical faculty participated in the Intermountain Healthcare Delivery Institute Advanced Training Program (ATP) to apply skills and competencies in QI to the effective management of patients with OUD. Internal Medicine faculty subsequently implemented the Ambulatory Opioid Stewardship Program (OSP), including a safe prescribing bundle (bundle), designed to promote value-based care (improve quality and outcomes at lower cost). The OSP and bundle resulted in a 10% reduction in 30-day physician opioid prescribing. This program was recognized ACP Arizona for their intervention and innovation. Finally, the CAO/DIO; Program Director for Addiction Medicine; and Associate Director, Family Medicine Residency Program serve on the Arizona Statewide Curriculum Workgroup to develop the Arizona Pain and Addiction Curriculum for Graduate Medical Education. This evidence-based curriculum may serve as the foundation for the teleECHO sessions.",

The video will discuss fluid loss and the negative implications of poor hydration status during hiking, and provide ways for hikers to come up with personalized fluid recommendations. For the evaluation of the video, we plan to recruit 170 hikers over a period of 4 months during spring and summer 2020 to watch the video just before the start of a hike at one of the selected trails. At the end of the video, hikers will be asked if they think they brought enough fluid for their hike. Hikers will then have the opportunity to add fluid to their personal stock from our stockpile, as they see fit. We will determine hikers individual fluid needs by gathering pre-hike and post-hike urine samples, body weight and fluid intake. Additionally, we will continuously measure core temperature using a non-invasive telemetric core temperature sensor to determine the experienced heat stress of the hikers as we expect that this is the main factor driving fluid needs. Finally, participants will answer a short questionnaire about the severity of complaints experienced throughout the hike. These combined results will allow us to assess if the video is effective to influence whether hikers made the correct decision to stock up on fluids or not. We can also determine if hikers consumed adequate fluid during the hike.",

FP00023223,207,,,,,1,,,"Changing Systems for Health: School food programs are designed to improve childrens dietary consumption in school settings and align them with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.1 The proposed innovative project uses a systems approach to test the potential for amplifying documented benefits of one of the United States Department of Agricultures (USDA) newest and most targeted school food programs  the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) beyond school settings. We will build on our previous work2,3 and connect three systems currently embedded in low-income, disadvantaged communities, capitalizing on their synergies to improve diets and health of FFVP participating children and their families. These systems include (1) school food service operations that implement the FFVP, (2) food retail in low-income communities, and (3) Maricopa County Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) serving FFVP participating schools.  We previously found3,4, that elementary school-age children participating in the FFVP make persistent requests (or nag, as some parents put it) for fruits and vegetables they tried in school as part of the FFVP snack when they go shopping with their parents. We plan to build a public-private partnership (PPP) to cross-promote in retail stores near FFVP schools the fruits and vegetables used as FFVP snacks in schools. The cross-promotion efforts, built around principles of marketing commonly used in stores, will be designed to ensure access and affordability of fruits and vegetables to encourage parents to purchase these items. Our partners, including Phoenix-based grocery stores, FFVP schools, and Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH), have expressed tremendous interest in building such a PPP to amplify the benefits of the FFVP. Our innovative project tackles major root causes of unhealthy eating. Key determinants of food choices include individual preferences, access, and affordability. Even when parents strive to improve their childrens diets, they are unlikely to invest in food their children will not consume, particularly when the food budget is tight. The FFVP has been shown to increase participating childrens preferences for fruits and vegetables, and FFVP-participating childrens persistent requests for fruits and vegetables at home and when grocery shopping are likely to provide impetus for parents to purchase these items. Our plan is to make fruits and vegetables readily available and affordable through a concerted cross-promotion campaign in stores where parents usually shop. Current evaluations of the FFVP, including our work, show that participating children consume more fruits and vegetables both in and out of school.48 FFVP participating children also make more persistent requests at home and grocery stores for fruits and vegetables they tasted in school4, suggesting that a strategy can be developed around promoting FFVP items in retail stores to encourage parent purchase. Coupling an established, federal school food program with marketing interventions in nearby retail can be an effective win-win strategy for all partners. To ensure sustainability of this partnership and to enhance broad applicability, SNAP-Ed, a program that works in low-income communities across the country, will serve as a facilitator (see Figure 1). USDAs SNAP-Ed aims to improve diets of SNAP eligible individuals and families by engaging with communities, local institutions, and businesses to employ policy, systems, and environmental approaches. Our goal is to inform current local FFVP implementation practices and USDA program policies to include specific guidance on developing PPPs for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among disadvantaged populations.  We will provide tools for establishing and implementing sustainable, long-term, multi-sectoral community-based partnerships, in Arizona and across the country.",
FP00023227,208,,,,,1,,,"Cardio-metabolic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are among the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.1 About 63.1% of adults 60 years or older were living with the hypertension between 2011 and 2014; 25.2% of adults 65% or older are living with diabetes2,3. Less than half (49.4%) of adults who were 60 years or older living with hypertension had their blood pressure controlled (SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg) between 2015 and 2016.4 The economic burden of hypertension and diabetes is profound. It has been estimated that between 2003 and 2014, on average, the adjusted annual incremental cost of hypertension among US adults was $131 billion per year compared to their non-hypertensive counterparts5. In 2017, it was estimated that the direct and indirect cost of diabetes care was $327 billion6. These costs are exacerbated by medication non-adherence which results in avoidable hospitalizations7-9. Avoidable costs due to medication non-adherence for diabetes and hypertension was estimated to be $43.2 billion in 201310. Diabetes and hypertension are more prevalent among low-income and food insecure populations of older adults3,4,11. Further, higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension has been reported among food insecure individuals12. Food insecure individuals living with diabetes and/or hypertension are also more likely to report sub-optimal outcomes such as sub-optimal glycemic or blood pressure control13,14 as well as increased likelihood of cost-related medication non-adherence15,16even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics 17. Thus, older adults living with type 1 or 2 diabetes who are not adherent to medications are at risk for developing diabetic complications-such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis and those living with hypertension could develop hypertensive urgency or emergencies with acute target organ disease. These complications could result in emergency department visits or hospitalizations.There is growing recognition of what is being termed the eat or treat trade-off low-income households make between food and prescription drugs to treat chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.  According to Berkowitz et al. (2014), among those who reported a chronic illness in the National Health Interview Survey, 23.4% of adults reported cost-related medication underuse, 18.8% reported food insecurity, and 11% reported both. Interestingly, multivariate results indicated that SNAP participation was associated with a higher risk of each negative outcome, suggesting that the population receiving SNAP is negative selected with respect to material hardship. More recent research using a propensity score matching technique found that SNAP reduced the rate of cost-related medication underuse for older adults (Srinivasan and Pooler 2017).  Similar evidence of the higher prevalence of medication non-adherence among food insecure older adults has been documented both in state-based samples (Bengle et al. 2010; Sattler and Lee 2012) as well as in nationally representative data (Alfunai et al. 2015).  Further, growing evidence suggests that food insecure older adults have higher healthcare utilization costs (Bhargava and Lee 2016a; Bhargava and Lee 2016b; Bhargava et al. 2012; Berkowitz et al. 2017).  SNAP participation is likely to reduce the incidence of diabetic and hypertensive emergencies by improving diet quality.  Diet quality among those with diabetes has been shown to be lower among low-income populations and those with food insecurity (Orr et al. 2019).  Additionally, food insecurity was associated with inadequate disease control among those with both diabetes and hypertension (Seligman et al. 2010). While it is well documented that both the timing and size of household food expenditures are tied to SNAP benefits (Nord and Prell 2011; Tuttle 2016; Valizadeh and Smith 2019; Kim et al 2019), little research has directly connected the size and timing of SNAP benefits to healthcare utilization using administrative data (Heflin et al. 2016; Arteaga et al. 2018; Ojinnaka and Heflin 2018; Heflin et al. 2019; Heflin et al. 2020) and this research has not focused on the older adults, who are half as likely to participate in SNAP when eligible compared to prime aged adults--42% compared to 83% overall in 2015 (Gray et al. 2017). The current literature on medication non-adherence and food insecurity suffers from several significant limitations. First, most of the research documenting the treat or eat phenomenon uses survey data (Berkowitz et al. 2014; Alfunai et al. 2015; Srinivasan and Pooler 2017), which likely suffers from measurement error in the self-reports of chronic diseases, medication under-use and SNAP participation.  Second, within the medical literature the standard approach to study medication non-adherence requires using administrative data containing pharmacy claims but this data lacks information on patient income and SNAP participation (Calip et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2018).  3) Finally, although older adults consume a growing level of medical resources and are comprising a larger share of the total population, most of the research to date has not focused on this age group (Herman et al. 2015).  This study allows us to make a significant contribution to the field by combining administrative data on pharmacy claims, SNAP administrative data (containing both benefit level and exact disbursement data) for a census of the population age 60 and older from a Midwestern state from 2007-2014.   Expected Results and ImpactResults of the proposed study will make a significant research contribution to the field.  The use of administrative data containing both prescription drug claims and SNAP benefit data will provide a good empirical test of the survey data reporting high levels of food insecurity and cost-related medication underutilization. Additionally, given the policy variation during our time period due to the AERRA benefit increase in the size of the SNAP benefit, it will be possible establish a causal relationship with the size of the SNAP benefit and the rate of medication adherence as well as the need for subsequent emergency care resulting from the medication non-adherence in either the ED or hospital setting.  Additionally, given that Missouri disburses SNAP benefits over 22 days per month in manner that is nearly random, it will also be possible to causally identify if there is a time of the month in which SNAP disbursement reduces the prevalence of either medication non-adherence directly or the emergency complications requiring acute care in the ED or hospital setting for diabetes or hypertension. In addition, the study will yield policy-relevant findings about the connection between medication adherence for the high prevalence diseases of diabetes and hypertension, emergency healthcare utilization patterns for these diseases (both ED and hospitalizations), and SNAP participation. In addition to producing timely causal results linking SNAP benefit size and timing of disbursement to medication non-adherence and health emergencies requiring care in the ED or hospital setting, the study will also include a cost benefit analysis. This CBA will include the costs of medication non-adherence in terms of treatment in the ED and hospital against increases in SNAP benefits.  Ultimately, as the Nation considers the rising cost of healthcare, this study will yield policy relevant information about the causal linkages between nutritional support and the health and healthcare utilization of older adults.",

FP00023254,210,,,,,1,,,"Despite well-established health benefits,1-5 6,7 consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) remains low,8 especially among children from low-income households.8-10 School-based interventions, including the USDAs Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), have shown promise in influencing dietary behaviors of children. 11-14, 15-19,61 The FFVP provides FV as snacks at least twice weekly outside of school lunch and breakfast programs in participating low-income elementary schools. Since its implementation in 2008, one national evaluation conducted in 2011-1219 and two subsequent studies,15, 61 including ours, showed that FFVP participation significantly increased FV consumption. However, these assessments were based on cross-sectional designs, were confined to older elementary school children (4th-6th graders), and relied upon self-report to measure FV intake. Such outcome measures are subject to error, undermining their validity for informing food policy.21,22 Further, dose response to frequency (number of days FV offered) and length (duration of participation) of exposure  important to establishing causal attribution  has not been investigated. Use of non-invasive biomarkers provides an opportunity for rigorous studies to objectively assess FV consumption in children and provide reliable evidence of the impact of the FFVP on the full age spectrum of elementary school children. Skin carotenoid levels have been validated as a biomarker for overall FV consumption (ref). The Veggie Meter, a non-invasive, cost-efficient, and easy to use device for measuring skin carotenoids, has been shown to be as effective as the gold standard68 for assessing FV consumption (2 Jahns papers from above). Our pilot studies and research by others(REF) have demonstrated the feasibility of using the Veggie Meter with young children in school settings, establishing that it is a viable instrument for objective assessment of the impact of the FFVP on FV consumption.  We have shown that children attending FFVP schools report making more frequent requests of parents for buying FV while shopping and are more likely to ask for FV at home.15 Parents report that these persistent requests for FV often convince them to purchase more produce.20 When more produce is available at home, children, adolescents, and adults are likely to eat greater amounts of FV (Patrick 2005, Spurrier 2008, Larson 2012). These findings suggest that the impact of the FFVP may extend beyond school settings and increase childrens and their familys FV consumption at home. This prospect deserves rigorous testing because, if true, it can be instrumental in developing strategies to amplify the benefits of the FFVP.      To assess the impact of the FFVP on childrens FV consumption, we will employ a longitudinal design with repeated measures and matched comparison groups, using non-invasive, objective measures of FV consumption. We will also examine whether the impact of the FFVP extends beyond participating children by measuring parents consumption of FV and in-home availability of FV. To improve generalizability of our findings, we will conduct the study in Arizona and New Jersey, two states with varied population characteristics and where the study team has extensive experience. Sixteen FFVP schools (with current + previous year of participation) will be randomly selected, and matched with an equal number of non-FFVP schools (no participation in current last 3 years) using strict matching criteria; from each school, three 1st  6th grade classrooms will be randomly selected and all children in a selected classroom will be invited to participate (n=2112). Measurements on children will be obtained in fall and spring of the school year. An independent sample of 40 parents from each selected school will also be recruited to participate (n=1280).",

Proposal Title: Improved Understanding of Thermal Destruction Technologies for Materials Laden with Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances  3. Lead Principal Investigator: Kyle Doudrick, kdoudrick@nd.edu  4. Lead Organization: University of Notre Dame  5. Objective Poly-  and  per-fluoroalkyl  substances  (PFASs)  are  released  from  a  wide  range  of  sources, including  military  fire  control  operations  using  aqueous  film-forming  foams.  Several  U.S. military  bases  and  airports  have  PFAS  contamination.  Incineration  is  emerging  as  a  viable treatment  option  for  soils  contaminated  with  PFASs  and  other  PFAS-laden  wastes  generated from drinking water treatment (e.g., used sorbents). Thus, there is a need to better understand the behavior  of  PFAS  during  incineration.  The  technical  objective  of  the  proposed  research  is  to conduct  integrated  research  to  determine  thermal  behavior  for  PFASs and  mass  balances  using advanced analytical techniques on (i) conventional adsorbents [granular activated carbon (GAC), ion  exchange  (IX)]  preloaded  with  PFASs  from  drinking  water  wells  and,  separately,  aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) impacted  water, (ii) AFFF impacted soils, and (iii) AFFFs added to simulated reverse osmosis (RO) and IX brines.   6. Technical Approach We will first establish standard operating procedures for a state-of-the-art analytical approach for analyzing the behavior of PFASs in solids, liquids, and gases in incinerators. Our approach will use  Particle  Induced  Gamma-ray  Emission  (PIGE)  spectroscopy  and  Liquid  or  Gas Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC- or GC-MS/MS). The speed and low-cost of PIGE will allow far more possibilities to be tested within the project duration and budget. Using this analytical approach, we will screen the specific thermal behavior of numerous PFASs (n>50) under  varying  incinerator  conditions  (e.g.,  waste  type,  temperature,  gas  flow).  We  will  then evaluate the  incineration  of  wastes  or  GAC  loaded  with  aqueous film-forming  foams  (AFFFs), providing  a  complete  F  mass  balance  throughout  major  incinerator  processes.  Finally,  we  will investigate the use of calcium and phosphate augmentation  of the waste to reduce the volatility of  PFAS  during  incineration  by  forming  calcium  fluoride  and  fluorapatite  minerals  within  the waste/GAC. ETC  7. Benefits For  the  first  time,  a  complete  picture  of  the  behavior  of  PFAS-laden  wastes  will  be  provided, including a mass balance within the incinerator and strategies to improve the incineration process to ETC  contaminants exhaust volatile reduce gas. the in   Commented [KD1]: A brief description of the environmental issue to be addressed, emphasizing its relevancy and importance to DoD, followed by the objectives of the proposed project.

FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick TECHNICAL SECTION 1.0 SERDP RELEVANCE The  following  research  needs  are  particularly  relevant  to  thermal  destruction  technologies  and will be studied in this work:   Quantify  thermal  temperature  necessary  to  volatilize  and  destroy  PFAS  within  thermal   Apply robust analytical methods suitable to track total fluorine and by-products in solid, destruction process (Task 2) liquid, and gas phases (Task 1)   Conduct  mass  balances  on  PFAS  in  reactors  during  multiphase  thermal  regeneration and/or incineration of adsorbents, soils, and liquid wastestreams (Task 3)   Reduce lifecycle impacts of PFAS treatment technologies by demonstrating performance of  regenerated  commercial  GAC  and  develop  tailored  adsorbents  that  improve  thermal regeneration attributes (Task 4a)   Discover  new  material  additives  for  soils  or  liquids  containing  PFAS  that  selectively favor  innocuous  by-products  over  greenhouse  gases  (e.g.,  CF4)  or  other  by-products (Task 4b)  2.0 TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE  The overall objective is to conduct  integrated  research  to determine  thermal  behavior  of per-  and  polyfluoroalkyl  substances  (PFASs)  and  mass  balances  using  advanced  analytical techniques on (i) conventional adsorbents [granular activated carbon (GAC), ion exchange (IX)] preloaded  with  PFASs  from  drinking  water  wells  and,  separately,  aqueous  film-forming  foam (AFFF)  impacted  water,  (ii)  AFFF  impacted  soils,  and  (iii)  AFFFs  added  to  simulated  reverse osmosis (RO) and IX brines. The research will include both thermal regeneration of PFAS-loaded GAC  and  incineration  of  other  PFAS-laden  solids  and  liquid  wastes  (Figure  XX).  The  results should lead to the improved lifecycle assessment of PFAS treatment systems and reduced human or ecosystem exposure to PFASs.   Currently, the most widely applied approach for treating PFAS-contaminated sites is ex-situ  GAC  adsorption.  Other  ex-situ  treatment  technologies  (e.g.,  IX,  nanofiltration,  RO)  have been  demonstrated  to  varying  extents,  but  each  process  also  generates  one  or  more  residual  or concentrate streams that require careful management. Our unique analytical approach will utilize Particle  Induced  Gamma  Ray  Emission  Spectroscopy  (PIGE)  to  directly  quantify  fluorine  in solid,  liquid,  and  gas  samples  and  couple  it  with  liquid-  and  gas-chromatography  tandem  mass spectroscopy (LC- and GC-MS/MS) and ion chromatography.  Improved understanding of the thermal behavior of PFASs during adsorbent regeneration or  waste  stream  incineration  will  only  occur  through  integrating  advanced  analytical  methods, understanding  PFAS  thermal  properties,  and  translating  thermal  destruction  studies.  The proposed  research  integrates  the  above  components  and  will  be  conducted  by  a  team  that understands the wide range of research, regulatory, and practitioner perspectives.   This  research  team  is  uniquely  qualified  to  conduct  this  research  and  leverage  three currently awarded SERDP/ESTCP projects related to PFAS analytical techniques and lifecycle of ion  exchange processes for treating PFAS. Members  have experience in PFAS remediation  and water treatment using GAC and IX; development and application of unique PFAS methods (e.g., PIGE)  suited  for  analysis  in  aqueous,  gaseous,  and  solid  phases;  incineration  and  regeneration thermal  processes;  air  chemistry  and  pollution  abatement;  and  practical  deployment  of technology  during  Environmental  Security  Technology  Certification  Program  (ESTCP)  1  Commented [KD4]: Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the environmental issue and knowledge of the state of the science.

FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick demonstration and full-scale implementation. Figure XX. Technical Objective  3.0 TECHNICAL APPROACH 3.1 Background  3.1.1 Occurrence of PFAS at DoD Sites PFAS  are  a  group  of  over  5,000  synthetic  organic  chemicals2  that  are  ubiquitous  in  the environment  and  many  pose  a  potential  emerging  threat  to  human  and  environmental  health.3-8 PFAS  have  been  used  in  consumer  products  for  over  50  years  because  of  their  hydrophobic, oleophobic,  and  heat/chemical  resistant  properties.  They  have  been  used  as  stain-guards  in textiles and carpets, oil-repellents in fast-food wrappers and other food packaging (e.g., popcorn bags),  water-repellents  in  cosmetics  and  ski  wax,  corrosion  resistance  for  pipes  and  wires, building  and  construction  materials,  automotive  parts,  mist-suppression  in  chrome-plating factories, and non-stick surfaces in cookware.9-14 They are also used in AFFF, which is a product formed  by  combining  hydrocarbon  foaming  agents  with  fluorinated  surfactants  and  is  highly effective product  fighting  high-hazard flammable liquid  fires.15 This has  also been  a significant source of contamination stemming from military fire training and local oil-spill related fires.16-22 AFFFs  contain  numerous  known  and  unknown  PFAS,  with  the  major  species  being perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs), perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs), and fluorotelomers (FTs).17, 20, 22-27 Consequently, the PFAS from consumer products, industrial manufacturing, and AFFF use have been widely detected in landfill leachates,28-34 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and land-applied  biosolids,9-14, surface  waters,[cite] groundwaters,[cite]  drinking  water,[cite]  soils,[cite]  and  air.[cite]  In  particular,  high  and variable40  PFAS  concentrations  have  been  detected  at  military  and  fire-fighter  training  and operational  facilities  due  to  the  routine  use  of  AFFF.41-55  Remediation  of  these  sites  and managing residual wastes from potable water treatment  will strongly influence the ultimate  fate of PFAS in the environment.  3.1.2 Thermal Destruction of PFAS  Many PFASs are recalcitrant to advanced destructive treatment methods such as advanced oxidation, and energy-intensive or large-footprint technologies such as plasma or electron beam are not easily accessible. Physical separation processes such as GAC, IX, and RO are feasible but the  waste  still  needs  to  be  disposed.  Thermal  destruction  (i.e.,  incineration)  offers  a  common, widely available method for dealing with wastes, and many reactors are already operating across the  US.  Information  on  thermal  treatment  process  efficiencies  and  costs  is  critical  to  fill knowledge  gaps  in  life  cycle  assessment  models  for  PFAS  and  to  document  the  formation  of thermal  incineration  by-products.  Todays  commercially  available  treatment  technologies  for stormwater,[cite] 35-39  urban 28, 30,  2 FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick municipal  drinking  water  and  groundwater  remediation  impacted  by  industrial  or  AFFF  PFAS sources include GAC, IX,  and RO separation.  These lead  to solid  wastes (from GAC or IX)  or liquid  wastes (from  IX or RO brines). High PFAS levels  can  also exist  in  other  materials (e.g., contaminated soils, munitions) that require physical destruction (i.e., demilitarization materials). Thermal  regeneration  or  incineration  of  solid  and  liquid  wastes  are  of  growing  importance  as treatment systems are deployed and as some communities regulate and limit disposal options for PFAS-containing wastes. The  incineration  of  solid,  liquid,  and  sludge  wastes  is  dependent  on  the  residence  time,  operating  temperature,  mixing/turbulence,  and  presence  of  excess  oxygen.  The  waste  and incinerator type also play a significant role. Typically, incineration is done in a reactor containing a primary and secondary chamber. In the primary chamber, the waste is heated and volatilized at temperatures >800 C (~1,500 F). This creates a gas stream composed of products of incomplete combustion  and  volatile  compounds  that  escaped  before  decomposition.  In  the  secondary chamber,  the  incomplete  combustion  products  and  volatile  fraction  from  the  primary  off  gas  is treated  at  temperatures  >1,100  C  (~2000  F)  for  more  than  2  s.  Liquid  wastes  can  also  be directly  injected  as  small  droplets  into  the  secondary  chamber.  The  exhaust  of  the  secondary chamber  then  moves  onto  air  pollution  control  devices  (e.g.,  acid  scrubber)  before  entering  the environment. Capital costs are well known for these systems, and operating costs depend strongly on fuel sources. GAC regeneration is a slightly different process, wherein the thermal process is kept at lower temperatures (<815 C or ~1500 F) and often in the present of an inert atmosphere to avoid oxidation and damaging the pore structure. Less common chemical reactivation of GAC can be done at ~100 C under alkaline conditions.  For waste incineration, complete destruction of PFASs will be critical. Key to this will be understanding  the  temperatures  at  which  PFASs  are  volatilized  and  mineralized  (i.e., defluorinated).  There  is  very  limited  prior  knowledge  about  the  thermal  behavior  of  PFAS-laden materials during high-temperature treatment, with only a handful of relevant studies to date involving  waste  incineration,56-58  GAC  regeneration,59,  60  or  general  behavior.61-64  For  waste incineration, Wang et al. has shown that introducing calcium supplements to PFAS improves the mineralization factor as well as reducing the time and temperature required.56-58 PFSAs were less volatile  than  PFCAs  and  FOSAs.  These  studies  were,  however,  done  under  very  limited conditions  involving  a  simple  furnace,  and  in  only  one  study  a  real  waste  (wastewater  sludge) was used.57 For GAC regeneration, Wanatabe et al. has shown that for GAC laden with PFOA, PFHxA, PFOS, a temperature of 700-1000 C (N2 gas flow; t = 15 min) was sufficient enough to mineralize the PFAS in GAC.59, 60 The temperature conditions played a significant role, striking a balance  between  PFAS  mineralization  in  the  GAC  and  PFAS  volatilization  from  the  GAC.  At temperatures  below  700  C,  less  volatilization  was  observed  but  mineralization  was  lower, between  700  C and  900  C PFAS  was significantly  more  volatile  yet  not  destroyed  in  the  gas phase,  and  above  1000  C  destruction  of  the  gas-phase  was  observed.  Thus,  a  two-chamber system  would  be  ideal  for  GAC  regeneration.  Many  of  the  volatile  PFASs  detected  in  the  gas-phase  were  short  chained,  indicating  that  partial  mineralization  occurred  before/during volatilization. Mineralization on the GAC increased with NaOH augmentation, similar to the use of lime.56-58 Even with modern analytical methods, these studies missed up to approximately 25% of the total mass balance, indicating the need for a total F analytical method.  3.1.3 Preliminary Data: Demonstration of PIGE to Analyze Incineration Behavior  Calgon  GAC  (Filtrasorb  400)  was  loaded  with  PFOA,  PFHxS,  and  PFBS  (3  mg/g)  and then  heated  from  300  to  750  C  in  a  muffle  furnace  (Figure  XX).  The  concentration  of  PFAS  3 Commented [KD5]: Awaiting PIGE results FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick remaining  in  the  GAC  was  analyzed  using  our  advanced  analytical  technique,  PIGE  (Section XX). At 300 C, all PFASs remained in the GAC. PFOA was most stable, PFBS the least. At 750 C, all was removed.  Prelim Results  3.1.4 Project Hypotheses 1.  The  volatility  of  PFAS  is  controlled  by  chain  length,  head  group,  and  the  number  of  C-F bonds, and this will impact the operating temperature in the primary chamber for incineration of PFAS-laden  waste  or  GAC  regeneration.  The  thermal  behavior  can  be  correlated  to  these properties, with lower volatility occurring for longer chains, PFSAs, and fully fluorinated PFASs. 2. With a state-of-the-art analytical approach (Section XX), the fate of PFASs during incineration or GAC regeneration can be determined using a complete F mass balance of a two-stage furnace.  3.  Augmentation  of  PFAS-laden  wastes  and  GAC  with  calcium  and/or  phosphate  will  result  in the formation of stable minerals (calcium fluorides and fluorapatites) that reduce the volatility of PFASs and increase the mineralization of PFASs within the waste/GAC.  3.2 Approach Our research approach addresses the statements of need (SON) shown in Table 1 through  four  integrated  research  tasks.  Our  analytical  methodologies  are  a  critical  aspect  of  this  project because we propose a unique approach  (i.e., PIGE) that  was pioneered by  our team and  part  of currently  funded  SERDP  awards.  Thermal  reactivation  and  incineration  will  be  studied  in  lab-scale tubular furnaces and kilns with controllable temperatures and gas flow/composition.  Table 1.

Thermal  technologies  4 Commented [KD6]: Provide the technical approach and methods, preferably structured in hypothesis-driven tasks that clearly identify how the objectives of the proposed project will be addressed. This section should be the primary focus of the proposal. Provide details about the experimental design and methodology. If the methodology is new or unusual, describe it in sufficient detail for evaluation. Commented [KD7R6]: Full proposals must provide the information listed below and a draft of the performance objectives table shown in Section 2 of this document.  Identification of types of media (e.g., drinking water, surface water, soil, sediment, biota) to be collected  Identification of PFAS analyte list for each media type to be collected  Identification of sample collection, sample preparation and analytical procedures to be utilized for each media type  Identification of class of result (quantitative or qualitative) to be reported for each media/analyte combination  Identification of intended use of data sets (e.g., definitive, screening) FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick is will  require  measurement  of  parent-PFASs and  by-products in  multiple  phases and  will  require uniform  and  accurate  methods.  High  resolution  LC-MS/MS  is  the  state-of-the-art  approach  for identifying and quantifying PFAS in water or solvents eluted from solid phase matrices. Various strategies  can  measure  total  and  fractions  of  inorganic  plus  organic  fluorine  in  solid  and  liquid samples. While some analytical techniques exist for total fluorine in solids (e.g., 19F-NMR), these methods  suffer  from  low-throughput  capabilities  relative  to  a  DoD-supported  total  fluorine quantification method developed at University of Notre Dame, termed Particle Induced Gamma Ray  Emission  Spectroscopy  (PIGE).  ESTCP  (ER201633) investigating  PIGE  for characterizing the nature and extent of PFAS in environmental media at DoD sites, and SERDP (ER19-C2-1142) is  developing  PIGE into a  rapid field-screening  rest for  PFAS.  PIGE provides unprecedented speed and cost efficiency for total  organic fluorine analysis directly  on  solids  or liquid  and  gas  samples  after  minimum  preparation.13,  14  PIGE  is  central  to  our  high-throughput approach,  and  it  will  be  used  in  conjunction  with  liquid  or  gas  chromatography  tandem  mass spectrometry  (LC-  or  GC-  MS/MS)  to  quantify  target  PFAS.  PIGE  accomplish  all  the  project objectives  within  the  3-year  timeline.  Most  significantly,  this  PIGE  technology  exists  only  at University of Notre Dame at present, and we have assembled a team of experts to perform these tasks to take advantage of this method in critical areas where we can address PFAS incineration.  PIGE Methodology. We previously developed PIGE as a screening tool for the presence of  PFAS  in  textiles  and  paper.13,  14  Recently,  we  have  developed  an  operating  procedure  using commercial  solid  phase  extraction  (SPE)  media  to  yield  quantitative  analysis  for  aqueous  and gaseous samples. In solids, the detection limits are low ppm, but these methods can also be easily adapted to extract low masses of PFAS from solids (e.g., ash) to reach ppb levels. Together with inorganic fluoride baseline measurements, PIGE can measure total PFAS on a larger number of samples  (i.e.,  thousands)  at  a  lower  budget  compared  to  target  analysis.  This  means  we  can process multiple samples and thus provide a more complete and statistically-relevant analysis for PFAS incineration. For any solid sample, irradiation with accelerated protons for 60180 seconds typically  yields  a  statistically  significant  signal  above  background  that  is  proportional  to  the number of fluorine atoms present. For aqueous samples or liquid extractions from GAC, IX resin, soil, sludge, sediment, or ash, samples are passed through an SPE prior to PIGE analysis. PIGE analysis only requires  ~3  minutes per sample. This means our laboratory can  measure 200500 samples per day at a cost per sample that is approximately  1/10th the cost of the modified EPA method  537.1  analysis.  PIGE  will  not  identify  which  specific  PFAS  are  present,  but  it  can  be used  to  determine  total  PFAS  mass  balances  in  an  incinerator  under  controlled  experimental conditions.  Further,  we  can  use  PFAS  as  a  rapid  screening  method  to  reduce  target  analyses costs.  For  example,  we  can  screen  for  PFAS  in  ash  samples  and  then  only  run  LC-MS/MS  on samples with PFAS present.  5 FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick  Fig. XX. Schematic detailing total PFAS analysis using PIGE. Solid samples can be run directly on  PIGE  to  identify  total  PFAS.  For  liquids,  samples  are  first  prepared  using  SPE  cartridges. These  are  then  directly  analyzed  by  PIGE.  Samples  are  loaded  onto  a  wheel  that  holds approximately  50  samples.  We  can  achieve to  nmol  mass concentrations.  low-level  analysis  down Mass  Spectroscopy  and  Ion  Chromatography  Methodology.  LC-MS/MS  and  GC-MS/MS will be used for target analysis of ionic and volatile PFAS, respectively. We will follow the  EPA  533  method  that  is  valid  for  25  compounds;  other  methods  will  be  used  when appropriate (e.g., SW8327). The team has multiple students/postdocs who are already trained to analyze PFAS with these standard methods. Using isotopically mass labeled standards at 10 ppb (Wellington  Laboratories)  to  account  for  changes  in  instrument  performance  and  procedures outlined  previously,44,  65  we  will  develop  routine  analysis  for  other  important  PFAS  (e.g., FTOHs).  For  routine  QA/QC,  we  will  perform  replicate  analysis  on  10%  of  samples.  Method blanks will be included with every batch of samples analyzed. Ion chromatography will be used to quantify fluoride ions, when appropriate. A full QA/QC report will be available upon request.  Task 2: Screen the thermal behavior of PFAS present in GAC, soil, and liquid waste. There are  numerous  operating  parameters  that  will  affect  the  behavior  of  PFAS  in  an  incinerator,  but understanding  the  temperature  that  PFAS  is  mineralized  or  volatilized  and  the  temperature  that the gas-phase is destroyed will be key. This task will focus on the destruction of PFASs and the presence  of  PFAS-specific  byproducts  in  the  off-gas.  In  Task  3,  we  will  focus  on  a  complete mass balance to analyze all products. The destruction of solid and liquid wastes associated with remediation (soil, GAC, IX brines) will be considered different from the thermal regeneration of GAC.  This  focus  will  change  how  the  data  is  analyzed,  as  regeneration  of  GAC  will  require lower temperatures and stability against oxidation. Figure  XX  provides  a schematic  of  the  furnace setup  that  will  be  used  for  Task  2. This will simulate the primary chamber with control over the temperature, gas type, and gas flow. Off-gas  will  first  go  through  an  aqueous  trap  to  water  soluble  products,  including  HF.  The  water vapor  and  remaining  products  will  be  dehumidified/cooled  and  then  passed  through  an  OASIS  6 FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick HLB SPE for subsequent analysis. Four major variables will be considered: waste type, furnace temperature,  gas stream  makeup/rate,  and  heating  time.  Target  waste  matrices  to  be  considered will  be GAC  (Filtrasorb  400),  a  representative  soil  (i.e., silty  loam),  and  a  representative  liquid (i.e., IX brine). PFOA, PFOS, 6:2 FTS, 6:2 FTOH, and FOSA will be analyzed to determine the effect of head group, and then PFDA, PFHxA, and PFBA will be analyzed to determine the effect of chain length. Many  of these are major PFAS  in AFFF.  For the furnace temperature,  discrete samples will be treated at 300, 450, 550, 650, 750, 900, and 1000 C. Base conditions for these experiments  will  be  air  at  1.5  mL  min-1  for  15  min.  All  experiments  will  be  conducted  in triplicate  for  a  total  of  504  samples.  Separately,  the  gas  type  (air,  N2,  and  N2/O2  mixture),  gas flow rate, and incineration time will be tested for select samples (e.g., GAC loaded with PFOA). Analysis points will be the waste before and after heating and the SPE after heating. We will be using  PIGE  to  specifically  screen  for  total  F  and  we  can  accomplish  this  is  a  relatively  short amount  of  time.  The  screening  results  will  then  be  used  to  select  various  waste  samples  after heating  for  further  target  analysis  by  mass  spectrometry.  PIGE  is  non-destructive  so  these analyses  will  be  on  the  exact  same  samples.  The  target  analysis  will  be  used  to  confirm  the complete removal of PFAS in the solid and absence of inorganic F in the SPE.  Fig.  XX.  Incinerator  setup  for  Task  2.  Samples  will  be placed in an alumina crucible and placed in the middle of a quartz tube next to the thermocouple.     Task 3:  A total  mass balance approch to  determine the effect of  the incinerator operating parameters  on  the  fate  of  PFAS  in  a  multiphase  incinerator.  This  task  is  critical  for understanding  the  fate  and  behavior  of  PFAS  and  co-contaminants  during  the  production  and processing  of  residual  product  streams.  Mass  balances  must  consider  organic  and  inorganic species in multiple phases as illustrated in  Figure XX. Fluoride ions in water, gas (e.g., HF), or minerals  (e.g.,  CaF2)  are  desired  end  by-products  but  requires  advanced  analytics  on  total fluorine, at a minimum, to close a mass balance. Distribution of fluorine into the different outlets (i.e.,  bottom/stack  ash,  scrubber  water,  stack  gas)  depends  upon  composition  of  PFAS  residual waste  stream  (GAC,  IX,  soil,  liquid),  thermal  operating  temperature/contact  time  and  gas composition/flow, and type of air pollution control system. Thermal GAC regeneration will differ from thermal incineration of wastes. The incinerator setup consists of a primary chamber where the waste stream will be placed. Off-gas from the primary chamber go to the secondary chamber, which will have a separate temperature control. Finally, the final byproduct will move to various air  pollution  controls.  Solid  and  gas  samples  will  be  taken  at  various  points  throughout  the incinerator process, as outline in Figure XX.   Operating conditions herein will simulate conditions found in full-scale incinerators. For waste incineration, the primary chamber will operate at >800 C under air flow and the secondary chamber at >1,100 C under oxygen rich gas flow. For GAC regeneration, the primary chamber will  operate  at  <700  C  and  under  N2  gas  flow.  We  will  analyze  select  individual  PFASs,  7 FY2021 SERD Proposal ER21-C1-1107; Doudrick including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxA, PFDA, PFBS, FTS, FTOH, and FOSA, but the focus will be on the use of real AFFF samples that consist of numerous PFASs. All samples will be analyzed by mass spectrometry for target species and PIGE will be used to close the F mass balance. Fig. XX Schematic thermal regeneration or incineration process showing inlet and multiple outlet flows for PFAS and by-products.    Task  4:  Tailored  adsorbents  to  improve  reduce  PFAS  in  off  gas  during  thermal regeneration and incineration. Harmful volatile organic fluoride compounds can form from the thermal  treatment  of  PFAS  wastes,  including  potent  greenhouse  gases  such  as  CF4.58 Opportunities exist to incorporate additives into GAC for regeneration or wastes for incineration. These additives reduce the volatility of PFASs and improve the mineralization of PFASs within the  GAC/wastes.  In  Task  4,  we  will  investigate  simple  and  novel  additives  with  the  goal  of reducing the formation of harmful gaseous byproducts. All experiments conducted in the furnace detailed in Figure XX.  First  (Task  4a),  we  will  screen  simple  additives  to  GAC,  including  calcium  (CaCO3, Ca(OH)2,  CaO),  phosphate  (Ca3(PO4)2,  NaH2PO4).  The  goal  is  to  encourage  the  formation  of CaF2  or  fluorapatite  within  the  product  ash,  thus  reducing  volatility  and  presence  of  volatile organic  fluorine  compounds  (including  PFASs)  in  the  gas-phase  during  thermal  regeneration. Additionally,  understanding  the  impact  of  thermal  regeneration  conditions60  of  specific adsorbents (e.g., GAC) on subsequent performance59 and/or leaching of F-containing material is important  in  understanding  the  lifecycle  implications  when  reusing  GAC.  Findings  from  GAC provides  knowledge  on  potential  efficacy  of  using  additives  in  soils  or  other  wastes  containing PFAS.   Second (Task 4b), we will investigate the use of advanced additives. Our experience with microwave  heating  to  degrade  organic  pollutants  in  soils  will  be  translated  to  PFAS  treatment using  silicon  carbide  (SiC).  SiC  is  an  excellent  microwave  absorber  with  high  thermal conductivity.  It  heats  up  rapidly  when  added  to  soils,  has  high  thermal  and  corrosion  resistant, and has high gas adsorption capacity that can retain volatile PFAS by-products within the heated zone. Si-H/C-F metathesis is thermodynamically-favorable reaction, given that Si-F is a stronger bond than C-F, and C-H is a stronger bond than Si-H. Hydrogenated SiC can effectively activate C-F bond via hydrodefluorination66, and thus it can reduce the formation of harmful fluorinated byproducts. We will explore SiC as an additive during thermal treatment.  3.3 Milestones All  standard  reports  and  documents  will  be  completed  and  submitted  as  required  by  SERDP including the project overview, annual execution plans, quarterly progress and monthly financial reports, interim technical reports, and the draft and final technical reports.

Therefore new treatments are likely to be most effective at the diseases early stage before pathology reaches an irreversible state, which underscores the importance of identifying biomarkers that are predictive of early signs of cognitive impairment. Human voice contains rich information related to cognitive health. Speech difficulty is among the first noticeable signs of cognitive impairment, suggesting that voice might be a potential diagnostic biomarker because it is able to capture subtle cognitive changes that traditional measures cannot detect.1 In addition, voice recording is typically of low cost and has high penetration scalability, which make it broadly distributable to hundreds of millions of people. However, earlier studies are typically based on small numbers of selected participants in cross sectional studies, which are typically more highly educated, reside in dense urban areas and are ethically and culturally homogeneous, severely limiting their generalizability to the general population both within the U.S. and globally . The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of digital voice as a novel biomarker for AD. We will leverage a rare longitudinal dataset of digital voice recordings from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), which is a community-based cohort study initiated in 1948. Three generations of participants have been enrolled along with two smaller multi-ethnic cohorts. The first neuropsychological (NP) test protocol was administered in 1976 and expanded to a larger battery of tests across all FHS cohorts beginning in 1999. We have digitally recorded all spoken responses to NP test questions since 2005. To date, we have collected 9500+ digital voice recordings on 5500+ participants; 3,250 of them have completed at least two voice recordings. This unique dataset enables the identification of voice biomarkers long before the manifestation of cognitive impairment.",

Recently,  epidemiological  indicators  of  MA  availability and use have shown a rapidly increasing trend in many parts of the country,1,3,4 in particular in the Midwest and South.3  Between  2015  and  2016,  overdose  deaths for  psychostimulants  (i.e., methamphetamine)  increased  33%  in  the  US,  and  130%  in  Ohio.7  In  2017  methamphetamine  became  the most frequently identified drug in forensic crime laboratories across the nation.3 While an earlier MA epidemic was associated with locally produced MA,12 multiple measures restricting the sales of pseudoephedrine caused a  downturn  in  domestic  production.19  Ultimately,  this  paved  the  way  for  the  recent  influx  of  more  potent, Mexican-made MA (crystal),20,21 which DEA data suggest has decreased in price (per pure gram) from $98 in 2011 to $58 in 2016, while the purity increased from 85.5% to 93.5%.4 The current MA outbreak is affecting communities that had little prior exposure to highly potent crystal-type MA, including Dayton, Ohio.   Numerous prior studies have shown that MA use is associated with a range of cardiovascular problems22-24 and increased burden of psychopathology, including mood and anxiety disorders, psychotic illness, and violent behaviors.22,25-33  MA  use  among  individuals  who  also  use  heroin/NPF  may  add  to  the  increased  risk  of unintentional  overdose,6  infective  endocarditis,34  and  a  greater  prevalence  of  high-risk  sex  behaviors  and unsafe  injection  practices.2,35,36  Emerging  ethnographic  evidence  suggests  that  users  are  inclined  to  view crystal  MA  as  cleaner,  and  therefore  less  harmful  than  locally  produced,  powder-type  MA.37  To  design effective intervention and policy responses, more research is needed to understand user knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to the current MA outbreak, including reasons and patterns of use as well  as  perceived  benefits  and  risks.  Since  prior  research  has  shown  notable  gender-related  differences among MA users,19,38-41 assessment of the current outbreak will obtain preliminary understanding of attitudinal and behavioral differences between male and female MA users in the Dayton area.   With increased availability of crystal MA, new patterns of use indicate a growing overlap between MA and heroin/NPF outbreaks as greater numbers of people use both drugs.1,5,6 Further, emerging research suggests the increasing risk of cross-contamination between MA and illicit opioids, particularly NPFs.3,13,14 In addition, some  studies  suggest  that  the  current  outbreak  of  MA  use  is  proliferating  among  very  diverse  user  groups, including cocaine users and ethnic minorities that had not been previously associated with the MA use scenes in  the  Midwest.42  Key  toxicological  and  behavioral  dimensions  associated  with  the  convergence  of  the  two epidemics---heroin/NPFs  and  MA--are  not  yet  understood.  In  addition,  more  research  is  needed  to understand the heterogeneity of the MA user population, including those who are currently involved in MA and heroin/NPF co-use, those who may have quit heroin/NPFs in the recent past and transitioned to MA, and those MA users who have never been involved with heroin or NPF scenes.  A.2.  Why  Dayton,  Ohio?  Known as the Gem City  for  its  historic  importance  in  the  glass cutting  industry,  Dayton  (Montgomery  County, Ohio)  was  once  considered  a  center  of industrial  innovation.43  Currently,  the  Dayton area  is  considered  an  epicenter  of  the  heroin and  NPF  epidemic.  The  average  age-adjusted unintentional  drug  overdose  death  rate  (2012-2017)  per  100,000  population  was  56.5  in Montgomery  County,  compared to  state average  of  27.9.44  The  local  drug  market  is saturated  with  high  availability  of  NPF-type drugs.11,16  With  increased  prevalence  of  NPF-type  drugs,  MCCO/MVRCL  data  indicate  a surge  in  methamphetamine  seizures  (Figure 1).8 Most prior studies on current MA outbreaks were  conducted  in  the  Western  or  Southern states.5,19,27,28,45-53  Our  focus  on  the  Dayton area  is  significant  because  it  is  a  region  of the  Midwest that  displays  signs  of unprecedented  increases  of  both  MA  and NPF use. Figure 1.

Why  Mixed-Methods  Approach?  The  study  integrates  qualitative  and  structured  interview components to assess active user knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to MA use. Qualitative, open-ended interviews have been recognized as valuable tools in developing an in-depth understanding of drug use practices and trends. As Agar pointed out, it is important to recast ethno in epidemiology to better understand the insider perspectives and folk explanatory models associated with drug use practices and risks.54 Adding a  structured  interview  component  to  the  in-depth,  open-ended  interviews  will  contribute  to  the  efficiency  in obtaining  preliminary  assessment  of  an  emerging  problem.55  Our  study  combining  qualitative  and  structured interview components will provide exploratory data needed to understand user perspectives and experiences with the evolving MA outbreak.56   Urine  toxicology  data  obtained  from  active  MA  users  and  analyzed  using  state-of-the-art  lab-based methods (GC/LC and LC-MS/MS),15,57 will provide accurate and specific information about user exposures to different  types  of  illicit  drugs,  including  MA  and  NPFs.  Combined  with  information  about  attitudes  and behaviors obtained from qualitative/structured interviews, urine toxicology data will help to better characterize polydrug use practices, cross-contamination issues of MA, NPF and other drugs, and user ability to identify the presence of different psychoactive drugs in the drugs they consume.   Forensic data on seized drugs is a valuable data source to assess changes over time in drug availability trends. Postmortem toxicology data provide indicators on use trends, patterns of co-occurring substances and socio-demographic information of decedents testing positive for MA and other drugs. Analysis of the forensic data  will  help  triangulate  active  user  interview  and  toxicology  findings  to  obtain  a  multi-dimensional characterization of the evolving MA outbreak in the Dayton area. Our multi-stream data collection approach will provide critically important findings on the impact of the characteristics of the MA outbreak in the context of the opioid crisis that can inform public health interventions and policy.  A.4. Preliminary Research. R21 study on NPF outbreak in the Dayton Area: The study contributed to the development of liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method15 to identify 34  fentanyl  analogues,  metabolites,  and  other  synthetic  opioids  in  biological  matrices  at  sub  ng  mL-1 concentrations. Postmortem toxicology data were analyzed to assess NPF trends in the Dayton region.11 More research  is  needed  to  assess  evolving  MA  outbreak  and  an  emerging  overlap  with  NPF  trends.  In addition, 60 active heroin/NPF users were interviewed and their urine toxicology was tested to identify NPFs and heroin. Over 88% tested positive for NPFs, including 86% fentanyl, 48% carfentanil, 42% acetyl fentanyl. Sensitivity and specificity for NPF use were 84% and 83.3%, accordingly, while Cohens Kappa was 0.445.58 Our  established  collaboration  between  CITAR  and  MCCO  Toxicology  laboratory  and  tested  research protocols to collect and analyze urine toxicology data will help carry out the Aims.       R01 study on diverted buprenorphine use: Our current longitudinal study with opioid-dependent people who use diverted buprenorphine suggest that MA use is prevalent in this population. 61.9% of our baseline sample (n=360) reported use of MA in the past 6 months (53.4% male, 95.5% white, mean age 38.3 years), and  about  25%  reported  MA  use  2  days/week  or  more  frequently.  These  preliminary  data  provide  support about an emerging pattern of MA and heroin/NPF co-use, but additional data collection and analyses are needed to better understand user knowledge and behaviors in relation to MA co-use, which is beyond the scope of the current R01 study that focuses on buprenorphine diversion.  Pilot Interviews with MA users: We recruited and interviewed 4 MA users (2 male and 2 female, all white, 34-42 years of age) to obtain preliminary understanding of recruitment strategies and explore user experiences with MA. One participant was a daily IV user of both MA and heroin/NPF, and one was a former heroin/NPF user who was now using MA and cocaine intravenously on a daily basis. The remaining two were active users of both drugs, but reported using MA to gradually reduce their NPF use. Our preliminary findings as well as prior  studies  support  our  rationale  to  recruit  three  groups  of  MA  users:  1)  MA  users  who  also  are current active users of heroin/NPFs; 2) MA users who do not use heroin/NPFs currently, but have a recent history of heroin/NPFs use; 3) MA users who have never used heroin/NPFs.   B. INNOVATION   The study is innovative in its use of detailed active MA user urine toxicology data obtained through lab-based  GC/LC  and  LC-MS/MS  methods.  Integration  of  urine  toxicology  with  qualitative/structured  interview assessment  as  well  as  forensic  data  sources  offers  an  innovative  approach  to  better  identify  convergence between  the  MA  and  heroin/NPF  epidemics.  Our  approach  is  also  novel  because  it  compares  initiation pathways, motivations, adverse health consequences, and treatment needs of current MA users across three discrete drug-using groups, taking up the urgent task of understanding how concurrent drug epidemicsin this case opioids and MA, to better inform public health policy and treatment. C. APROACH C.1.  Research  Team.  Dr.  Daniulaityte  is  Associate  Director  of  CITAR.  She  has  been  conducting  mixed-methods epidemiological research in CITAR for the past 15 years. She has been PI on 5 NIDA-funded studies. Dr.  Carlson is Director of CITAR. He has been PI on 4 large-scale natural history projects, most recently a study with young pharmaceutical opioid users. Dr. Silverstein is a Research Assistant Professor at CITAR. Trained  as  an  anthropologist,  she  has  conducted  qualitative  research  on  the  links  between  drug  production and consumption. Currently, she is a Co-Investigator on our R01 focusing on buprenorphine diversion in the Dayton area. Dr. Nahhas is a biostatistician and has worked with the team for the past 9 years on multiple research  projects,  including  natural  history  studies  on  illicit  opioid  use,  an  RCT  comparing  acute  and continuous treatment, and web-based studies on cannabis and NPF drug availability and use. Dr. Juhascik is the Chief Toxicologist at the Montgomery County Coroners Office/Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab. He has worked with the team on the Montgomery County Poison Death Review project59 and current R21 study on NPF  use  in  the  Dayton  area.11  Our  consultant,  Dr.  Zule,  has  conducted  ethnographic,  epidemiologic,  and intervention  research  with  people  who  inject  methamphetamine,  opioids  and  other  drugs  for  over  25  years. Taken together, we have an exceptionally well-qualified interdisciplinary research team to complete the study. C. 2. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Characterize knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to MA use among 90 active  MA  users  (30  CURRENT  heroin/NPF;  30  PAST  heroin/NPF;  30  NEVER  heroin/NPF)  and conduct  preliminary  analyses  of  similarities  and  differences  between  the  three  subgroups  through integration of ethnographic and structured interview data.  C.2.1.  Data  Collection:  The  study  integrates  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  collection  and analysis. All interviews will be conducted at the CITAR field office space located in downtown Dayton. The team has substantial experience of conducting research with large samples of active illicit drug users.60-64  C.2.1.1.  Stage  I  (qualitative,  formative  research):  Formative  research65,66  will  include:  1)  Two  focus groups (5-6 participants each) with substance abuse treatment and law enforcement professionals;  2) 8-10 current or past MA user interviews to obtain key informant perspectives. All participants will complete an IRB-approved informed  consent before the interview/focus group begins. Interviews will last about 1-1.5 hours, and  participants  will  be  compensated $30  ($20  for  their  time  and  $10  for  transportation).  Interviews  will explore  the  following  major  domains:  a)  Experiences  interacting  with  individuals  who  use  MA;  b)  Perceived extent  of  the  problem  and  characteristics  of  individuals  who  use  MA;  c)  MA  user  recruitment  strategies  for stage II interviews. Informal, ethnographic-type interviews will help build rapport and understanding of cultural norms  and  topics  that  are  sensitive  or  important  from  the  participants  point  of  view  67,68  Formative  stage interviews will inform development of Stage II interview protocols. Stage II interview protocol will be piloted with 2 active MA users as a part of formative research stage. C.2.1.2.  Stage  II  interviews  will  follow  a  mixed-methods  approach  and  will  include  focused  qualitative interview  sections  and  brief  structured  assessments  on  a  selected  number  of  key  variables.  In  addition, unobserved  urine  samples  will  be  collected  for  toxicological  analysis  (C.3.).  Participants  will  be  engaged  in interviews after completing an informed consent form and compensated $40 ($30 for their time completing the 1.5-2 hour interview and $10 for transportation). The recruitment strategy for Stage II participants will include elements of purposive and snowball sampling.69 Participant recruitment will include flyers shared in the community,  referrals  from  grass-root  organizations  and  service  providers  in  the  community,  and  key informants. Key informants will be compensated for up to 2 eligible referrals ($15 per referral). To  assure fulfilling recruitment objectives, we will monitor accrual of people recruited into each of the three sub-groups.  Eligibility criteria: 1) at least 18 years of age, 2) reside in the Dayton metro area, 3)  report current MA use (use on at least 2 days in the past 7 days); 4) the sample will be stratified by heroin/NPF use as follows: 4a) CURRENT heroin/NPF use (heroin/NPF use on at least 2 days in the past 7 days); 4b) PAST heroin/NPF use (heroin/NPF use within the past 2 years but not within the past 3 months to capture recent heroin/NPF users  to  assess  transitions  associated  with  the  MA  outbreak);  and  4c)  NEVER  heroin/NPF  use  (no  lifetime history    of  heroin/NPF  use).  History  of  non-medical  pharmaceutical  opioid  use  will  not  be  included  in  the eligibility  assessment  (but  captured  during  interviews)  since  non-pharmaceutical  pain  pill  distribution  scenes are distinct from heroin/NPFs. Since this is an exploratory R21, eligibility criteria may be modified slightly after conducting formative research to ensure that we capture Dayton area users who have a broad range of knowledge and experience using MA products. Screening for Eligibility. We will use a screening process to recruit eligible participants that we have used successfully  in  the  past.70,71  First,  we  will  employ  a  brief  telephone  screen  to  identify  potential  participants.  Second,  those  who  appear  to  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  will  be  scheduled  for  an  office  visit  where  they  will complete an office screen to confirm (or not) eligibility AFTER completing an informed consent. The team has extensive  experience  screening  participants  to  ensure  eligibility  criteria  are  met  in  studies  with  diverse populations of illicit drug users.70-72 The  Stage  II  interview  protocol  will consist of a brief, structured assessment section and open-ended, qualitative response section.  Structured assessment will include: 1) Socio-demographic characteristics, 2) Years since initiation of METH and other drugs; 3) Modes of administration and frequency of use of METH and other drugs in the past 6 months; 3) Number of unintentional overdose experiences; 4) Number of times ever enrolled in substance abuse treatment for METH, opioids, and other drugs; 5) Perceived need and access to substance  abuse  treatment  services  for  METH  and  other  substances;  6)  Standardized  questions  related  to attitudes,  reasons,  and  beliefs  about  METH  use  (developed  based  on  formative  research  assessment), including perceived availability, sources, and  average price per gram by METH type; 7) Past 30 day use of METH, NPFs and other drugs (Timeline-Follow-Back Method).73-75 Questions for the structured component will be entered into REDCap, which is supported by the University. TLFB data will be used to assess patterns of use and to compare to urine toxicology data (C.3.) The structured component will last about 40-50 minutes.  An open-ended, qualitative interview section will focus on providing contextual information and eliciting user  perceptions  and  motivations  related  to  initiation  of  MA  and  other  drugs,  drug  transition  pathways, preferences and reasons for polydrug use practices, understanding of contamination issues, explanations of health  risks  and  treatment  needs.  The  qualitative  section  will  be  pretested  to  reduce  overlap  with structured interview section and to ensure on-target, focused data collection to increase feasibility of processing and analyzing qualitative responses in a timely manner. The open-ended component will last about 45 minutes.  C.2.2.  Qualitative  Analyses.  All  Stage  II  qualitative  interviews  will  be  transcribed  verbatim.  NVivo,  a powerful text management software, will be used to code and analyze all qualitative interview transcriptions for major  themes.68,76  Research  codes  for  pre-determined  and  emergent  categories  (open  coding)  will  be generated to index segments of text that refer to specific themes. To assure reliability of the coding process, after initial standardization of the codebook, Drs. Daniulaityte, Carlson, Silverstein and a Research Assistant will independently code a set of interviews. The codes will be compared, and discrepancies will be discussed and resolved.68 We will explore the following topics to obtain qualitative insights on user knowledge, attitudes, and  behaviors  related  to  MA  use:  initiation  of  MA  use,  social  context,  and  personal  motivations;  user explanations and perceptions of benefits and adverse consequences of MA use; explanations of patterns and reasons  of  MA  use  and  polydrug  use  practices;  knowledge  about  NPFs  and  overdose-related  risks;  and treatment  needs  and  experiences.  Analyses  will  focus  on  identifying  similarities  and  differences  among  the three groups and between male and female respondents. C.2.3. Statistical Analyses. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the sample as a whole and by  the  three  MA  groups  (mean,  standard  deviation,  and  median  for  continuous  variables  and  number  and proportion  for  categorical  variables).  Socio-demographic  and  drug  use  characteristics  (e.g.,  number  of days of MA use in the past 30 days, route of MA administration, number of drug-related overdose experiences in the past 6 months, and perceived need for substance abuse treatment) will be compared across the three groups  using  chi-square  tests  (for  categorical  variables)  and  ANOVA  (for  continuous  variables).  Appropriate alternative  methods  will  be  used  when  assumptions  are  not  met.  Additionally,  we  will  test  for  differences between  males  and  females  in  their  MA  and  other  drug  use  characteristics  using  Chi-square  tests  (for categorical variables) and t-tests (for continuous variables). These analyses will be repeated using multiple regression (linear regression for continuous variables, and binary, ordinal, or multinomial logistic regression for categorical variables) to adjust for confounding due to socio-demographic characteristics. Additionally, we will use multiple logistic regression to identify socio-demographic and drug use characteristics associated with perceptions of lower risk of METH use (vs. greater risk).  Power  for  comparison  of  characteristics  between  the  three  groups: A sample size of 30 per group  provides  80%  power  to  detect  an  effect  size  as  small  as  0.33  (ratio  of  between  to  within  group  standard deviation) when conducting an ANOVA F-test at the 0.05 level of significance.77 For example, assuming the variation of 30-day METH use present in our natural history study of buprenorphine users (SD = 7.79 days), such an effect size would be present if, for example, the three groups differ by 2.59 days (e.g., 1 day, 3.59 days, 6.18 days) (SD of these three values = 2.59; 2.59/7.79 = 0.33). C.3. SPECIFIC AIM 2. Analyze urine toxicology and assess concordance with self-reported use of MA, NPFs, heroin and other drugs among 90 active MA users  C.3.1.  Urine  sample  collection:  All  Stage  II  participants  will  be  asked  to  provide  an  unobserved  urine specimen.  All  specimen  cups  will  be  labeled  with  a  number  that  links  the  urine  specimen  to  the  survey Table 1. NPFs and Metabolite Testing 1) 3-Methylfentanyl  2) 4-ANNP (Despropionyl fentanyl)  3) Acetyl fentanyl  4) Acetylfentanyl 4-methylphenethyl  5) Acryl fentanyl  6) Alfentanil  7) Butyryl fentanyl  8) Isobutyryl fentanyl  9) Butyryl norfentanyl  10) Carfentanil  11) Despropionyl para-fluorofentanyl  12) Fentanyl  13) Furanyl fentanyl  14) Furanyl norfentanyl  15) Norfentanyl  16) para-Fluorobutyryl  17) fluoroisobutyryl fentanyl  18) para-Methoxyfentanyl  19) Remifentanil  20) Remifentanil metabolite  21) Sufentanil  22) Valeryl fentanyl  23) AH-7921  24) U-47700  25) Beta-Hydroxythiofentanyl  26) para-Fluorofentanyl 27) Cyclopropyl 28) Crotonyl Fentanyl 29) Tetrahydrofuran Fentanyl,  30) Methoxyacetylfentanyl,  31) Benzylfentanyl,  33) Benzylcarfentanil, 34) U-49900 responses. No identifiable information will be placed on the specimen cups. Urine specimens will be stored onsite in a refrigerator until transportation to MCCO/MVRCL in coolers with ice packs. The samples will be transported weekly.  C.3.2.  Urine  Toxicology  Analysis:  At  the  MCCO  laboratory,  all specimens  will  be  analyzed  for  MA,  heroin,  ethanol,  and  other  common drugs  of  abuse,  and  prescription  drugs  utilizing  gas  chromatography  and liquid  chromatography  (GC/LC)  method.  NPFs  and  other  novel  synthetic opioids (Table 1) will be tested using liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)-based  method.15  Use  of  lab-based  methods (GC/LC  and  LC-MS/MS)  is  necessary  to  obtain  accurate  and  specific information  about  presence  or  absence  of  selected  drugs  of  abuse, including NPFs. These methods are currently used to analyze postmortem toxicology data in the Dayton area. Urine toxicology data will be compared to self-reported measures of MA, NPF, heroin and other drug use (using 3-day detection window).78,79 C.3.3.  Statistical  Data  Analyses:  The following descriptive measures of  concordance  of  self-report  with  urine  samples  will  be  computed: sensitivity,  specificity,  positive  predictive  value  (PPV),  negative  predictive value  (NPV),  and  Cohens  kappa,  and  their  associated  95%  confidence intervals.80 We will classify individuals based on their individual agreement between  self-report  and  urine  toxicology,  and  will  use  multiple  logistic regression to test for associations between agreement (the outcome) and socio-demographic  and  drug  use  characteristics,  and  MA  group,  with separate analyses for each drug (MA, NPF, heroin, and other drugs).  Power  for  binary  logistic  regression  (Aim  2): Assuming  a  baseline prevalence of 25%, a sample size of 90 provides 80% power to detect an odds ratio (OR) as small as 2.1 associated with a one standard deviation difference  in  a  covariate,  assuming  that  confounders  explain  10%  of  the variation  in  the  covariate.  For  example,  if  testing  the  association  between number  of  days  of  METH  use  in  the  past  30  days  and  the  probability  of agreement between self-report and the urine sample, we have 80% power to detect an association if individuals with one standard deviation greater METH use have 2.1 times the odds of agreement. If the baseline prevalence is only 10%, our sample provides 80% power to detect an OR only as small as 2.8 associated with a one standard deviation difference in a covariate.77 C4. SPECIFIC AIM 3. Analyze forensic data to characterize MA trends in the Dayton area.  C.4.1.  Forensic  data  collection.  The  study  will  conduct  secondary  data  analyses  of  crime  lab  and unintentional  overdose  data.  MCCO/MVRCL  maintains  a  detailed  database  on  drug  toxicology  results  of seized drug and overdose death cases. Toxicology data from overdose deaths are public record but identifying information (name, date of birth, address) will be removed prior to data transfer. Dr. Juhascik will periodically extract relevant data and share with the research team for further secondary data analyses.  C.4.1. Data on Unintentional Overdose Deaths. The collected data will cover the time period from 2015 to  2021.  MCCO/MVRCL  uses  GC/LC  and  LC-MS/MS  methods  to  conduct  postmortem  toxicology.  The following key variables will be extracted from toxicology reports for further analysis: 1) month/year of death, 2) MA-positive  or  negative  case;  3)  other  drugs  identified  in  MA-positive  cases  (e.g.,  NPFs,  heroin, benzodiazepines, cocaine, pharmaceutical opioids); 4) demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity/race).  Statistical  Analyses:  Overdose  death  data  will  be  used  to  characterize  temporal  trends,  socio-demographic, and drug-related characteristics of the MA outbreak. Logistic regression will be used to estimate temporal trends in the monthly proportion of overdose cases that are MA-related between 2015 and 2021, with time  modeled  initially  using  a  flexible  restricted  cubic  spline  function  to  not  impose  any  assumption  on  the shape  of  the  temporal  trend.  This  model  will  be  used  to  test  for  differences  in  the  temporal  trend  between cases that involved heroin, NPF and other drugs (e.g., odds of being MA-related among those with vs. without heroin/NPF), as well as test for associations between the proportion of overdose fatalities that are MA-related and socio-demographic, NPF, and other drug-related characteristics. To explore gender-specific associations, we will test the significance of interactions between gender and other socio-demographic characteristics (age, race) as well as drug use-related variables (toxicology reports about presence or absence of other drugs).  C.4.2.  Data  on  Seized  Drugs:  The MCCO/MVRCL chemistry section conducts the following analyses of seized products: 1) presumptive color screens such as the Marquis test for a wide range of drugs; 2) a routine GC/MS  analysis  is  used  to  confirm  the  presence  of  drugs  like  MA,  cocaine,  heroin,  fentanyl,  fentanyl analogues, etc.  Crime lab data will provide information on the numbers of cases that involve MA, other drugs, types and packaging of products received, and the prevalence of drug mixtures (MA only, MA and fentanyl, MA and carfentanil, etc.). Statistical  Analyses: Logistic regression will be used to test for temporal trends in the proportion of seized drug cases that contain MA. Poisson regression will be used to test for temporal trends in the absolute number of seized drug cases containing MA (and cases that contain mixtures of MA/NPF). We will use  time-lagged  cross-correlations81  to  estimate  the  magnitude  and  direction  of  association  between  the number of overdose deaths per month and the number of seized drug cases containing MA (as well as MA + various drug combinations) per month.   Power for binary logistic regression: In Montgomery County, out of 566 unintentional overdose deaths  in 2017, 18% tested positive for methamphetamine.8 Assuming this sample size and prevalence, we have 80% power to detect an odds ratio (OR) as small as 1.4 associated with a one standard deviation difference in a covariate, assuming that confounders explain 10% of the variation in the covariate.77 For example, if testing the association between age and the probability of an overdose case being MA related, we have 80% power to detect an association if overdose cases for individuals one standard deviation in age younger have 1.4 times the odds of being MA-related. C.5. Analysis Note (applies to all Aims in which regression is used): Given the small sample size of 90 individuals, we will limit the number of variables in each regression model. Rather than a multivariable model including  all  characteristics  of  interest  at  once,  we  will  test  them  each  one  at  a  time,  each  adjusted  for  the same  small  set  of  socio-demographic  confounders  (e.g.,  age,  sex,  race,  socioeconomic  indicators). Additionally, we will adjust for multiple testing across the set of tested predictors using the Hommel method82 to preserve a family wise  = 0.05 level of significance. C.6.  Data  Integration.  We  will  use  a  concurrent  mixed-methods  approach17,18  to  compare  and contrast  forensic  and  active  user  interview  findings to better understand key dimensions of the evolving MA outbreak, including concomitant drug use practices and contamination issues, gender-related differences and other socio-demographic and drug use characteristics of MA users. Data on seized drugs will be used to corroborate  user  reports  of  patterns  of  acquisition,  labeling  and  types  of  products,  including  distinguishing characteristics available.  C.7. Limitations. We acknowledge limitations of the study, including: 1) While we have a strong rationale for  the  three  subgroups  of  the  Stage  II  sample  and  analyzing  similarities  and  differences  among  them  is innovative, we also recognize that we may revise or expand on the number of groups based on this exploratory study when submitting an R01. 2) The number of individuals in each sub-group (n=30) is small, but we believe it is sufficient to generate meaning exploratory quantitative and qualitative findings.  C.5.  Dissemination.  Findings  will  be  presented  at  national  meetings  and  disseminated  through publications.    Findings  will  be  shared  with  the  Public  Health-Dayton  &  Montgomery  County  and  the  local Alcohol Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services Board to inform local intervention and policy responses. In addition, we will submit reports and findings for dissemination through the National Drug Early Warning System (NDEWS). C.6.  R01  Development.

FP00023299,215,,,,,1,,,"The microorganisms comprising the human gut microbiota (GM) are linked to a wide variety of biological systems in the host1 and participate in numerous beneficial host functions.210 Therefore establishing and maintaining a beneficial host-GM interaction is increasingly viewed as an important factor in mediating overall health and wellness.11 Increased microbial biodiversity and richness (total number of bacterial species) are widely viewed as hallmarks of a healthy gut microbiota.12 In contrast, human diseases are often positively correlated with reduced bacterial diversity and an environment favoring increased pathogenic bacterial growth,13,14 a state often referred to as gut dysbiosis.15,16 Symptoms of gut dysbiosis include gastrointestinal dysfunction,17 elevations in expression of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and other inflammatory factors,18,19 and shifts in GM function and metabolic products.20 As such, there has been interest in the role of the GM in the development of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.21 In relation, the GM has been proposed as a contributing factor to the pathophysiology of obesity and metabolic dysfunction.20,22,23 Diet is one of the main modulators of the gut microbiota,2426 with observational studies reporting a strong dietary effect on the composition and function of GM in globally distinct human populations.2730 In experimental studies, research has generally investigated short-term dietary interventions with smaller sample sizes,24,31 and is often characterized by extreme and unrealistic dietary intakes24 or specific foods items.3235 However, humans eat complex, mixed diets, and display poor adherence with overly restrictive dietary regiments, such as weight loss interventions.36 Relatedly, dietary interventions incorporating caloric restriction remain the cornerstone for treating obesity. Promising strategies such as intermittent fasting, which encompass eating patterns in which individuals go extended time periods (typically 12 days/week) with little or no energy intake, are increasingly being utilized to promote weight loss and improve body composition.37 Other strategies such as increased protein intake38 and consumption of liquid meal-replacements also appear to be effective for weight loss.39 Previous research combining these three strategies has reported increased effectiveness for weight loss, visceral fat reduction and improving coronary heart disease risk over a whole food diet in obese middle age women.40 In addition, an intermittent fasting, meal replacement-based diet (IFMR-D) was found to be more effective over a whole food, heart healthy diet (WFD) for prevention weight regain after an aggressive period of weight loss in obese men and women.41 These subjects also displayed improved body composition, energy expenditure, and cardiometabolic markers over the WFD.41,42 However, the effects of such a diet on the gut microbiota generally remain unexplored.Previous research with hypocaloric, high-protein diets have reported compositional changes and increased microbial richness.28 Furthermore, a short-term study with a small sample size investigated the effects of a liquid meal-replacement on the GM of healthy subjects.43 While this research reported some compositional changes, the studys short duration, lack of a comparator, and methodological rigor and analyses left many unanswered questions. Finally, low-grade chronic inflammation observed in obesity and metabolic dysfunction may be triggered by elevated endotoxin concentrations resulting from impaired gut permeability and dysbiosis,44 yet its measurement is lacking in clinical weight loss studies assessing the GM.  Therefore, we propose to the study the effect of a hypocaloric, IFMR-D on gut microbiome composition and predicted function, as well as circulating endotoxin in obese/overweight individuals. Additionally, we will evaluate the comparative effect versus a WFD.Specific Aims:Our aim is to study compositional and predicted functional changes in the GM over a 12-week intervention comparing an IFMR-D to a WFD in an obese population. A secondary aim is to assess circulating LPS concentrations between diet groups. We hypothesize that a 12-week IFMR-D will: 1) significantly affect the composition of the GM, 2) significantly and positively alter the predictive functions of the GM, and 3) significantly decrease circulating LPS concentrations, as compared to WFD in obese adults during weight loss. Findings from this study are expected to support the use of a calorie restricted IFMR-D based system that can easily be incorporated by individuals to improve indices of gut health and systemic inflammation. Given the prevalence and associated health costs of obesity, a dietary mechanism capable of influencing the gut and related health outcomes is of importance and is expected to advance current nutritional knowledge.Methods:Sample Collection. In collaboration with Dr. Paul Arciero, fecal and plasma samples will be collected from a larger weight loss intervention conducted at Skidmore College (Saratoga Springs, NY). Specifically, individual fecal and plasma samples from 40 subjects will collected at baseline, and weeks 4 and 12 (total n=120) and sent to Arizona State University (Tempe, AZ) by overnight shipping on dry ice. Fecal collection, storage, and transport will follow preestablished, validated methodology for ensuring maximal sample integrity.45 All samples will be stored at -80C until processing. Fecal Microbiome Analysis. Microbial genomic DNA will be extracted from fecal samples at each time point (n=120) using a commercially available kit (DNEASY POWERSOIL KIT Isolation Kit, MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from each sample will be identified by high-throughput sequencing at the ASU Biodesign Institute (Tempe, AZ). Illumina MiSeq will be performed on the variable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA, which is used to characterize genus or species in a diverse microbial population. Following Illumina sequencing, the raw sequences will be interpreted with an open source software, Quantitative insights into microbial ecology version 2 (QIIME 2). QIIME 2 provides an analysis of the sequences as well as graphical displays of the data. Differential microbial abundance differences between time and diet groups will be identified using linear discriminant analysis of effect size (LEfSe) analyses via the online Galaxy module. In addition, Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) will be implemented in Galaxy to predict Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional pathway abundance content from the 16S rDNA data using a closed reference OTU table created in QIIME and the Greengenes reference database.Plasma LPS Analysis. Plasma LPS concentrations will be quantified by a commercially-available kit (Pierce Chromogenic Endotoxin Quant Kit, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) per the manufacturers protocol to examine systemic circulation of LPS on samples collected at baseline and week 12 (n=80).",

Still, in between the cortex and spinal cord lies a completely untapped target: the brainstem. Unlike the cortex, the brainstem is less affected following cortical and most subcortical strokes (the survival rate of brainstem strokes is very low); therefore, movement initiated through this structure is more likely to be robust and intact. Historically, accessing the brainstem has required surgical techniques, but a recent non-invasive tool has made endogenous stimulation of the brainstem feasible in humans. StartReact (SR) is the startle-evoked release of voluntarily planned movement mediated by the reticular formation. We have previously shown that point-to-point reach training with brainstem stimulation via SR increases accuracy and reaching distance 16.1% and 18.2% respectively in individuals with severe stroke (UEFM < 42/66). These improvements occurr in a single session.  This is particularly compelling given the high degree of difficulty of generating functional changes in individuals with chronic, severe stroke. Recent reviews highlight that despite our best efforts, most new intervention strategies fail to benefit individuals with severe stroke likely due to the presence of large cortical damage in this population. This leaves two options: 1) new interventions to induce neural plasticity of the damaged cortex (e.g. TMS) and/or 2) facilitate recovery through preserved/spared systems. This proposal seeks to evaluate the latter. Recent evidence indicates that individuals with stroke strengthen ipsilateral connections from the healthy hemisphere to the brainstem during the natural process of recovery. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate if SR represents a method to      prime the nervous system to engage the spared reticular formation during rehabilitation to enhance voluntary speech production.  Speaking and reaching impairments are distinct in their effectors but they share utilization of the brainstem. The tegmentum is a critical convergence zone for orofacial muscles involved in speech production and damage to the pedunculopontine nucleus impairs speech highlighting the importance of the brainstem in speech formation. We have collected a preliminary dataset demonstrating that SR increases the probability of speech initiation by 33% and initiation is 14439 ms faster in individuals with stroke induced aphasia. LONG-TERM GOAL: We envision SR being used as adjuvant neuromodulatory therapy, alongside traditional therapy, to unlock preserved speech production capabilities in individuals with severe, non-fluent aphasia. SR may thereby allow individuals with severe aphasia to participate in traditional therapies, which require some residual capacity for speech production. Before we can obtain this goal, we must Objective 1: complete a more sophisticated and exhaustive evaluation of SRs capacity to enhance more complex speech production tasks post-stroke, and Objective 2: demonstrate that improvements generated via SR generalize to voluntarily initiated words.  7  Overview of the Study Design/Methods (500 words) Individuals with and without stroke-induced aphasia will perform 2 tasks: picture naming and repetition. We will use standard SR protocol describe in the literature. Briefly, the tasks will use a subset of the 175 words on the well-validated and characterized Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT). Thirty of the 66 target words in the PNT that contain at least one of the bilabial phonemes (b/p/m) will be selected because these phonemes can be easily quantified with accessible speech musculature described above. The 66 possible target words have a wide range of phontactic frequencies and one to four syllables. The repetition task will include the target words spoken by a recorded voice presented via speakers and the picture naming task will individually present pictures on a computer screen. Of the 30 words, 10 will be used in each of the three tasks. During each task, each word will be presented 30 times in random order (150 presentations/task). SR will be applied during 33% of all trials by replacing the soft SPEAK cue with a startling, acoustic stimulus of 128dB for 0.04s.  Analysis: We will evaluate SR-elicited speech compared to voluntary speech using acoustics (e.g. speech duration, speech intensity/frequency), kinematics (e.g., jaw displacement, velocity), and muscle activity pattern (e.g. latency, amplitude). We will use the Praat software package to define fundamental frequency and formant frequencies (first two formants) and use a semi-automated and visually inspected procedure implemented in MATLAB to extract kinematics, muscle activity, and acoustics.Trained lab personnel will qualitatively assess intelligibility of speech and determine frequency and types of errors (semantic, phonological, unrelated). Statistical comparisons: Hypothesis: SR-elicited speech will be associated with increased probability of speech initiation, faster, and more intelligible speech. To assess this hypothesis, a linear mixed effects model will be fitted to the data using R. Independent categorical factors will be trial (Voluntary/SR), population (stroke, unimpaired), and task (picture-naming, repetition) with subject included as a random factor to capture subject dependent differences. Multiple comparisons will be done to analyze the differences between tasks using lsmeans package in R to obtain pairwise comparisons between the trial types for each task. Tukey HSD will provide the post-hoc adjustments. 8  Relevance to the Scientific Field of Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation Research (100 words) This proposal seeks to determine if a non-invasive tool can induce neuromodulation of the brainstem to facilitate improved speech patterns in individuals with stroke induced aphasia. This is relevant to the field of neuromodulation because it represents a novel method (SR) and target (brainstem) for neuromodulation. This project is relevant to rehabilitation because its long term goal is to enhance speech therapy outcomes.  9 Is this a resubmission of a previously reviewed (but not funded) NM4R Pilot Project Program application?

FP00023330,217,,,,,1,,,"Cochlear implant (CI) users have significantly poorer Chinese tone recognition scores than normal-hearing (NH) listeners, because current CIs do not faithfully encode the fundamental frequencies (F0s) of speech, which are the primary acoustic cues for pitch changes in Chinese tones. Our previous studies showed that Chinese tone recognition with CIs significantly improved when the secondary loudness cues for Chinese tone recognition were enhanced by modifying the speech amplitude envelope to change in synchrony with the F0 contour. Targeted training using naturally-produced speech has also been shown to significantly improve Chinese tone recognition with CIs. Here, we propose to combine the two methods of speech enhancement and auditory training to further improve CI users Chinese tone recognition. In this pilot experiment, we will test Chinese-speaking NH listeners listening to noise-vocoded speech, which has been widely used as an acoustic simulation of CI processing. Our specific aim is to compare the efficacy of Chinese tone recognition training with CI simulations using naturally-produced speech vs. amplitude-envelope-enhanced speech. Our design differs from previous studies in that not only the percent correct scores but also the weightings of pitch and loudness cues for Chinese tone recognition will be measured before and after training. This allows us to investigate the perceptual mechanisms of training-induced improvements and inter-subject variabilities in Chinese tone recognition with CI simulations. Based on the results, we will apply for larger grants together with our collaborators in the Childrens Hearing Foundation in Taiwan to conduct training on Chinese tone recognition for Chinese-speaking CI users. Compared to the training paradigm using naturally-produced speech, the training paradigm using amplitude-envelope-enhanced speech is expected to be more effective because it may enhance the integration of pitch and loudness cues for Chinese tone recognition with CIs.",
FP00023341,218,,,,,1,,,"Children with hearing loss have smaller vocabularies than their peers with normal hearing. Such vocabulary deficits during childhood are known to negatively affect language development, academic achievement, psycho-social behavior, and vocational options. The aim of this project is to examine the manner in which hearing loss interferes with childrens ability to learn new words. At its most basic level, new-word learning involves two stages: an encoding stage during which the word is associated with a referent through multiple exposures, and a consolidation stage during which the acoustic and semantic representations of the word are transferred to long-term memory. Our research shows that encoding can proceed normally in children with hearing loss when they use hearing aids. However, recent work in our lab revealed that children with hearing loss recall significantly fewer words than their normally hearing peers. This suggests that normal encoding does not guarantee that the words will be remembered later. One potential explanation for this deficit in retention is that although children with hearing loss are able to associate words with referents, the auditory representation of the words in memory are degraded and insufficient for accurate recall. To test this possibility, in the first experiment, we will examine the effect of auditory perception on the consolidation of newly learned words in 24 children with normal hearing. These children will encode new words presented at three listening levels that correspond to three levels of speech-perception accuracy. If poor auditory representations formed during encoding impede memory consolidation, recall of the words should improve as speech perception increases. In a second experiment, we will examine the effect of increasing the amount of training in 24 children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. After correcting hearing loss to the fullest extent possible with hearing aids, the children will encode new words in three regimens that differ in the number of word/referent trials. If the auditory representations in memory are of poor quality, these representations should become clearer as the number of exposures increase, improving recall of the learned words.  Both experiments will be conducted simultaneously during the 12-month project period. Together the results of this project will add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that hearing loss can affect a childs auditory processing at the peripheral and central levels. Specifically, we will gain a better understanding of the extent to which hearing loss impairs learning and the need for alternative interventions that complement the auditory interventions that they currently receive.",
FP00023366,219,,,,,1,,,"The discovery of a biomarker is inexplicably essential for the progression of PSP research. The prevalence of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, while still considered a rare neurological disease, continues to rise as increasingly more misdiagnoses become evident. Despite devoted research endeavors to improve sensitivity of diagnosis criteria, post-mortem autopsy cases, and seemingly rare case reports, continue to challenge the current understandings of neuro-pathophysiology, expanding the scope of symptoms associated with the disease. Proteonomic studies have explored TAU protein composition of the cerebrospinal fluid of PSP patients and have made significant contributions to the scientific literature of the disease. However, proteonomic studies are limited in their diagnostic efficacy and the research demands metabolomic-based investigations. Despite a plethora of metabolomic investigations on Alzheimers (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD) and various other neurodegenerative disorders, the scientific literature lacks PSP specific metabolomic studies with a biomarker focus. This cross-sectional, descriptive exploration intends to employ a metabolomics approach in order to shed insight on the various biochemical mechanisms involved in the pathology and progression of PSP. In order to achieve the greatest level of metabolite coverage and to establish the most reliable panel of metabolites, database assisted globally optimized targeted mass spectrometry (dGOT-MS/MS) method will be utilized. This novel MS technique removes the need for chemical standards, while using a single liquid chromatography-triple quadruple-multiple reaction monitoring (LC-QQQ-MRMs), and can identify metabolites of both aqueous and lipid composition with high specificity and sensitivity. With a panel of metabolites available, physiological pathways, genome-wide associations, mitochondrial dysfunction theories, and drug-trials can be validated.

FP00023367,220,,,,,1,,,"Although physical activity is a behavior with well-established health benefits, there is still a significant part of the population that despite being aware of them, do not participate in it. Therefore, implying the existence of a brain component in exercise behavior. Regulation of motivation for voluntary physical activity has been linked to brain mechanisms related to cognition, reward, and habit and linked largely to the dopamine system (Yamamoto et al. 2017; Garland et al., 2011; Morgenson et al., 1980; Park et al, 2016). There is evidence that tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) specifically applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), induces extracellular dopamine in the brain (Fonteneau et al., 2018). We will apply tDCS in the DLPFC to increase extracellular dopamine in a part of the striatum involved in the rewardmotivation mechanisms at regular times over the course of few weeks, and monitor the physical activity of study participants over the course of these weeks. In addition to monitoring spontaneous physical activity, we will use prompts to complement the spontaneous locomotor behavior, and where subjects are prompted to break up their sitting/inactive behavior and move as they feel. The aim of the study is to determine physical activity behavior before and in the course of active (and sham) regularly-applied tDCS intervention that is coupled or not to concurrent exercise. Our hypothesis is that regularly employed tDCS coupled with small bouts of exercise can enhance the overall physical activity behavior of humans. Participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to a Sham or Active tDCS group, participants will perform 30 minutes of stationary cycling exercise coupled with brain stimulation 3 times a week for 3 weeks. Exercise will be performed following stimulation. Participants in each group will have their everyday physical activity monitored for 7 weeks total, before, during and after the period associated with tDCS stimulation. Physical activity will be evaluated by analyzing the accelerometry output data. It is expected that after the 3 weeks of intervention participants in the active tDCS group will show an increase in overall daily physical activity as compared to their baseline physical activity levels.",
FP00023367_Res1,221,,,,,1,,,"Anaissa Ruiz Tejada ACSM Grant Sumbission 1/2022.   Behavior Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to Enhance Physical Activity  Lay Summary   Although physical activity (PA) has well-established health benefits, less than 5% of adults over 20 years of age engage in daily physical activity for at least 30 mins. (6). Lower levels of physical activity are most likely related to a lack of motivation and drive. These aspects are known to have their biological basis on dopaminergic pathways in the brain (15). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) involves neuromodulation of the brain resulting from the application of low intensity, direct current to areas of the brain facilitating or inhibiting spontaneous neural activity. In humans, tDCS increases dopamine release in the striatum (17), an area that has been associated to motivation (15). What is yet to be shown is if tDCS can enhance physical activity behavior if coupled with an exercise/physical activity stimulus. It is hypothesized that active tDCS targeted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) prior to an exercise/physical activity stimulus, increases daily spontaneous physical activity when compared to the sham tDCS group.  The approach used will be a single-blinded parallel design. Participants will undergo tDCS (active or sham) for 20 minutes followed by fast-paced walking for 30 mins. These procedures will take place 3x/week for 3 weeks. PA will be monitored 2 weeks before the initiation of the tDCS/exercise interventions, during the 3-week interventions, and for 2 weeks following the completion of the interventions. Plasma samples from the subjects will be analyzed for concentrations of insulin, leptin, and ghrelin, all of which have been implicated in the regulation of spontaneous physical activity (16). Homovanillic acid (HVA) will be measured before and after tDCS and will be used as an index of central dopamine release (22). The expected results include higher physical activity levels in the course and after the intervention weeks in the active tDCS as compared to the sham tDCS and tDCS only. It is also expected that there will be an increase in plasma HVA after tDCS, suggesting increase in central dopamine release by tDCS. This project focuses on the brain and on the central neural mechanisms that provide the motivation to move. Although, there is knowledge on the mechanisms of tDCS to modify neural activity, there is still no evidence on the application of tDCS to enhance spontaneous, voluntary locomotor activity, which will have considerable effects in increasing physical activity behavior of the general population.

FP00023380,223,,,,,1,,,"There have been substantial increases in the use of diverted buprenorphine (BUP) in the U.S. Research PROJECT SUMMARY   suggests that increases are driven by people self-treating opioid withdrawal. A growing trend of BUP diversion represents an important, although little understood, part of the larger prescription drug abuse problem in the U.S. that is intertwined with the soaring heroin epidemic. The overall purpose of this natural history study is to describe and analyze the nature and consequences of diverted BUP use among heroin and/or non-medical pharmaceutical opioid (NMPO) users who meet criteria for DSM-5 opioid use disorder. The study will be conducted in the Dayton, Ohio, Metropolitan Area, an emerging epicenter of the heroin epidemic. The study uses a mixed-methods approach. In Phase I (formative research) qualitative data will be collected to inform Phase II data collection. Phase II (sample recruitment and longitudinal follow-up) builds on a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. We will recruit a community-based sample of 400 people with DSM-5 opioid use disorder who have used diverted BUP in the previous 90 days. The quantitative component will include structured baseline (N=400) and follow-up interviews conducted every six months for two years. The qualitative component will include 60 semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews with individuals selected from the larger sample based on results of Latent Class Analysis (LCA) of baseline quantitative data. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Describe key dimensions of BUP diversion, motivations and patterns of BUP and other drug use, HIV/HBV/HCV risk behaviors, history of unintentional overdose, and drug abuse treatment use. 2) Identify trajectories of diverted BUP product use over 24 months and analyze their dynamic relationship to health-related outcomes, including opioid use/non-use, HIV/HBV/HCV risk behaviors, unintentional overdose, and drug abuse treatment engagement. Understanding the nature of diverted BUP use and its effects on opioid use and utilization of substance abuse treatment services has important clinical and public health implications. The study is highly significant because it will advance our understanding of crucial scientific research questions on the mechanisms of BUP diversion and relationships between trajectories of diverted BUP use, length of abstinence from other opioids, HIV risk behaviors, unintentional overdose, and drug abuse treatment seeking and engagement. It is highly innovative because it will be the first study to provide a longitudinal, mixed-methods approach to analyze BUP diversion and trajectories of use in the context of complex interactions between self-treatment behaviors and use of drug abuse treatment services. The mixed-method design is also novel because we will use LCA analysis results to select the qualitative sample. Our research questions will provide findings with critical public health impact that could be used to inform the design of interventions to address the NMPO/heroin epidemics and issues of BUP diversion.

KRIGSMAN, FRYE, WALKER, AND ASHWOOD Research Proposal Jan 2020  TITLE:  Microbiota Transplant for Children with Autism and Gastrointestinal Problems:  An intensive study  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Describe in a paragraph of 5-10 sentences, in lay-person language, a summary of the problem, the study and impact)  Background:  Gastrointestinal problems such as chronic constipation, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain occur in about 30-50% of children and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  Those GI problems are also associated with worse ASD symptoms.  A pilot open-lable study of microbiota transfer therapy (MTT) was found to greatly reduce those GI symptoms, and also result in a nearly 50% reduction of ASD symptoms at two years after treatment stopped.  Proposed Study:  We propose to conduct an additional study of MTT for children with ASD, with a much more extensive evaluation of the participants.  This would include pre and post endoscopies (upper and lower, including biopsies and pill camera), and extensive evaluations of GI symptoms, ASD symptoms, microbiome, metabolomics, immunology, immunohistochemistry, mitochondrial function, and gene expression.  Impact:  This study will provide much deeper, multi-disciplinary insight into the pathophysiology of autism, and a much richer assessment of the full effect of MTT on their physiology and symptoms.  The study will attempt to characterize GI diagnostic subgroups to determine who is mostly likely to benefit from MTT.  In summary, this study will help develop a mechanistic understanding of the effect of MTT on the subjects, from a GI, microbiome, immunological, and mitochondrial standpoint.  This information would be important to submit to the FDA as part of the request for FDA approval of MTT for autism.    Goals ",

FP00023457,227,,,,,1,,,"Brain metastasis (BM) is a devastating life-threat outcome for patients with solid cancers, such as breast cancer. Due to the improvements in controlling the systemic disease, the development of brain metastases (BMs) has become a major limitation for quality of life and life expectancy in 10-30% breast cancer patients, and as high as to 46% in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Patients with TNBC do not respond to hormone or HER2-targeted therapies, thus have the worst outcome in all breast cancer patients. The median survival from the diagnosis of BMs in TNBC patients is just 4.9 months. To date, the underlying mechanisms for BM in TNBC are poorly understood, and no targeted therapies have been developed. Accordingly, identifying specific targets on TNBC cells for prevention of BM is an overarching challenge and is urgently needed. The clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic cancer rely on the interactions of the metastatic tumor cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to determine how breast cancer progress to BMs in the brain microenvironment and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating the disease. Our previous studies have shown while passaging TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells in astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) facilitated BMs in a mouse model, ACM-conditioned TNBC cells up-regulate the expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a secreted glycoprotein whose effect on tumor progression is context- and tumor type-dependent. Based upon these results, the objective of this application is to investigate the mechanisms of the regulation and the role of ANGPTL4 in the BMs of TNBC. In our preliminary studies, we further found 1) re-culturing ACM-conditioned TNBC cells reduced ACM-induced ANGPTL4 expression, and both DNA de-methylation and histone acetylation were involved in the up-regulation of ANGPTL4, suggesting the possibility for epigenetic regulation of ANGPTL4 expression by ACM; 2) isolated breast cancer stem like cells (BCSLCs) from both commercial and patient-tumor-derived TNBC cells could form tumor sphere and differentiate into more epithelial like cells (BCELCs) by inducing E-cadherin and reducing slug and vimentin expression, and also increased ANGPTL4 secretion in the form of glycosylated protein;  3) ACM increased ANGPTL4 expression in both BCSLCs and BCELCs; 4) for energy obtainment, BCSLCs mainly use mitochondria dependent way and BCELCs mainly use glycolysis dependent way. Transformation of BCSLC to BCELC increased the both ways of metabolism. However, knockdown of ANGPTL4 impeded the two ways of energy obtainment which can be rescued by cANGPTL4; and 5) RNA-seq showed the different alteration of energy metabolism pathways in BCSLCs and BCELCs. These results suggest that ANGPTL4 may functions on both BCSLC and BCELC to attribute to cancer BMs. In accordance with the possibility, we hypothesize that brain microenvironment (astrocytes) induce the expression of ANGPTL4 in the invading triple negative breast cancer cells, which promotes tumor progression to contribute to their brain metastasis formation. This hypothesis will be tested by the following aim:Specific Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms that regulation ANGPTL4 expression in TNBC cells. We hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the ANGPTL4 induction in the invading cancer cells, which will be addressed by defining the mechanisms of ANGPTL4 regulation by 1) DNA methylation, 2) histone acetylation; and 3) glycosylation through in vitro studies with two human TNBC tumor-derived cell lines and two commercial TNBC cell lines.Specific Aim 2: To determine the mechanisms that ANGPTL4 facilitate BM formation of TNBC cells. We hypothesize that ANGPTL4 is involved in the tumor cell survival, differentiation and further colonization to facilitates TNBC BM formation through reprogramming metabolism of invading cancer cells, which will be addressed by 1) defining the role of ANGPTL4 in the metabolic modification and involved the pathways by targeted metabolomic analysis; 2) defining the functional relevance of these transcriptional and metabolomic profiles; 3) elucidating the mechanisms of ANGPTL4 in the regulation of the key enzymes and metabolites; 4) identifying the key enzymes and metabolites using a mouse model and human tumor tissue. Understanding the processes that enable invading breast cancer stem like cells to progress to BMs will offer novel insights into the mechanisms for breast cancer brain metastasis. Furthermore, determining the key factor(s) in this process will provide more effective therapies. On this basis, this study, by focusing on determining the regulation and molecular roles of ANGPTL4 onto how invading tumor development to a metastatic growth, will arguably demonstrate ANGPTL4 as one of the most promising targets in current research for breast cancer brain metastasis treatment. Ultimately, accomplishment of this study will provide groundwork for uncovering novel intervention strategies to treat this catastrophic disease.",

FP00023465,229,,,,,1,,,"Abstract  Biomaterials-based strategies to modulate the immune responses has generated tremendous interest in the past decade.  Notably, biomaterials can not only be used for delivering drugs (synthetic or biologics) but by themselves can modulate the function of different cells.  Recently, we have demonstrated that the metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) can be polymerized, and these polymers by themselves are able to suppress activation of dendritic cells (DCs  forms the bridge between innate and adaptive immune system).  Interestingly, our preliminary data also demonstrates that delivery of PFK15, an inhibitor of PFKFB3 enzyme (a key step in glycolysis) downregulates CD86 (co-stimulatory molecule) but maintains MHC-II (stimulatory antigen presenting molecules) on DCs.  Notably, glycolysis can control the function of activated DCs.  Therefore, glycolysis-inhibition mediated prevention of DC activation and simultaneous antigen expression, can lead to antigen-specific immunosuppression responses.  However, systemic inhibition of glycolysis has inherent toxicity (clinical trials) associated with it, and have regulatory hurdles for clinical use.  Therefore, the main goal of this R01 program is to develop drug delivery vehicles that can deliver glycolysis inhibitors and antigens locally to DCs, which will then systemically suppress inflammation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that co-delivery of antigen and glycolytic inhibitor will induce DC tolerance and generate peripheral antigen-specific suppressive T-cells, which will then promote reversal of tissue inflammation. This strategy will be tested in a rheumatoid arthritis animal model. This hypothesis will be tested by performing experiments in the following aims: AIM 1: Test if paKG formulations can generate long-term remission of RA by maintaining metabolic homeostasis in joint tissues.  AIM 2: Determine the effect of paKG formulations on cells associated with arthritic tissue. AIM 3: Test the ability of paKG formulations to prevent progression of RA in K/BxN mice AIM 4: Develop scaled paKG formulations for safety/toxicity profiles. This research will be an important foundation in the development of technologies based on metabolic modulation of immune cells for autoimmune disorder treatment. The results from this project will generate a sustained release platform, which after application can prevent the progression of RA, or even reverse the damage. ",

Eligible patients were 6-to-12-years old and had elevated BMI at their most recent primary care visit. Results demonstrated significant direct effects on caregiver depression and indirect effects on child conduct problems, emotional problems, and psychosocial quality of life. Significant effects were also found on child and family health behaviors.

The FCU4Health advisory board will continue to provide guidance and support through the two aims of the proposed project. First, we will develop tools to facilitate the scaling up of the FCU4Health, including algorithms for stratifying families to level of provider and providing clinical decision support, a video portal with AI capabilities to support clinical supervision, and a platform to support communication and coordination with families between sessions. Next, we will conduct a small pilot with 30 families in primary care with integrated behavioral health.

FP00023531,231,,,,,1,,,"Children with hearing loss have smaller vocabularies than their peers with normal hearing. A common assumption is that hearing loss prevents the formation of clear auditory representations of new words in memory. Although it is not possible to examine a childs auditory representations directly, there is ample evidence that hearing loss degrades childrens: 1) perception of familiar and unfamiliar words, 2) perception of vocal prosody and emotion, 3) production of speech, and 4) precise localization of sound sources. Children with hearing loss also require more exposures to learn new words than children with normal hearing and they retain fewer words over time. To learn a new word, children must associate the acoustic properties of the word with a referent over multiple exposures in acoustically diverse contexts. There is evidence that words presented under acoustically varying conditions, like different individual talkers or listening environments, decreases speed and accuracy of word recognition while increasing later recall of the words from memory. These distinct perceptual effects suggest that auditory perception is highly sensitive to variations in the acoustic signal. Therefore, the central hypothesis to be tested in this project is that perception of acoustic variation in the auditory signal improves retention of newly learned words. If this hypothesis is valid, better retention of newly learned words will be observed in children who are able to access the acoustic variability in the auditory signal compared to children who cannot. To test this prediction, word recognition and word learning will be examined in 8- to 15-year-old children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss compared to peers with normal hearing. In each of seven experiments, children will learn 5 nonsense words without acoustic variations and 5 nonsense words with acoustic variations that represent daily communication. All words will be presented auditorily and the children with hearing loss will be tested with and without amplification that meets prescriptive targets for each childs degree and configuration of loss. Retention of the nonsense words will be measured with four-alternative forced-choice identification tasks immediately after learning and again 7 days later. Each aim will target a different acoustic domain representative of daily communication: 1) variations in speech acoustics including prosody, emotion, and multiple individual talkers, 2) variations in spatial acoustics including localization and motion, and 3) environmental acoustics including auditory scenes and reverberation. The acoustic characteristics selected for the first, second, and third aim vary in low-frequency, high-frequency, and broadband-frequency regions, respectively. Additionally, the source of the acoustic variations progress from those directly, indirectly, and not related to the talker, also respectively. The outcomes of these aims will separately and together specify the contribution of commonly occurring acoustic variations to word learning. The results of this research will have immediate and long-term impact on the interventions prescribed to children with hearing loss including hearing-aid signal processing that preserves acoustic variations determined to support vocabulary development.",

Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that regulates vascular function, and reductions in NO result in endothelial dysfunction and risk for CVD.  Estrogen is a potent endogenous stimulator of NO production and disruption of the estrogen-NO axes contributes to vascular dysfunction in post-menopausal women. However, NO can be derived from dietary nitrate sources independent from endogenous synthesis. Foods rich in dietary nitrates include cruciferous vegetables, leafy greens, celery, and beetroot.  We, and many others, have reported improved vascular function, including reductions in blood pressure, following beetroot juice consumption.  We envisioned the benefits of dietary nitrates for post-menopausal women given the known vascular dysfunction in this population. We were the first to conduct a small pilot trial to examine the efficacy of the daily consumption of leafy green salads on vascular health in post-menopausal women. The current proposal outlines a fully powered randomized, controlled crossover trial informed by our pilot data.

FP00023631,237,,,,,1,,," The criminal justice system is struggling to address the needs and manage individuals with 2 Opioid Use Disorders (OUD). Most U.S. correctional facilities do not continue or initiate 3 Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). As a consequence, the highest rates of opioid overdose 4 occur after release from incarceration. Incarcerated individuals with an OUD are a captive 5 audience, often highly motivated to voluntarily agree to MAT enrollment as an opportunity for 6 court diversion, or upon discharge from jail. Our proposal aims to increase MAT access and 7 other supportive services to individuals with OUD in the criminal justice system. The 8 comprehensive program will include a full array of treatment, coordinated and integrated care, 9 recovery support services, and prevention activities to increase the treatment rate of individuals 10 with OUD encountering the criminal justice system.

FP00023643,239,,,,,1,,,"Alzheimers disease (AD) poses immense health and economic burdens1-6. The AD death rate has increased steadily over the past two decades, and it is currently ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the US. An estimated 5.8 million Americans of all ages have AD, of whom more than two-thirds are women. Currently, the lifetime cost of care for a person with AD is more than $330,000, and a five-fold increase in both government and out-of-pocket spending for AD will take place by 2050. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop novel intervention approaches to intervene and treat AD.Bioenergetic shift involving fatty acid metabolism plays a significant role in AD pathogenesis7-13. The brain uses glucose as its main fuel for energy; however, reduced glucose uptake starts even at the early AD stage when amyloid- (A) oligomers and amyloid plaques begin to accumulate, creating an energetic crisis in this most energy-demanding organ in the body14. Under the circumstance of glucose insufficiency, fatty acids can provide an alternative energy supply in the brain. In cells, astrocytes expressing the APOE4 allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, display altered uptake and oxidation of fatty acids15. In animals, triple transgenic (3xTG)-AD mice concurrently have decreased glucose energy metabolism and upregulated hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HADH), an important enzyme in fatty acid -oxidation16. In humans, unsaturated fatty acids are significantly decreased in Alzheimer's brains when compared to brains from healthy controls17. These previous studies, and many others, clearly indicated the significance of fatty acid metabolism in AD. To at least partially address these fundamental gaps, we hypothesize that metabolic reprogramming in fatty acid metabolism, including down-regulated fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and/or up-regulated fatty acid -oxidation (FAO), is profoundly involved in AD development and progression. The overall objective of this study (short-term goal) is to further collect validation and mechanistic data in human subjects, and to establish whether 3xTg mice reproduce similar abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism, making them useful for exploration of mechanisms and testing of potential treatments. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are that 1) we will expand our previous work and confirm that the results from relatively small groups can be validated using larger groups, 2) we will provide strong insights into the mechanisms by which fatty acid metabolism is altered in AD, and 3) we will establish whether 3xTg mice are a useful model for evaluating the mechanisms associated with aberrant fatty acid metabolism and for assessing the potential for supplementation treatments to affect AD outcomes. Successful implementation of this multidisciplinary study will lay the foundation for the future development of novel interventional paradigms using lauric acid or other fatty acids to intervene in AD pathology (long-term goal).",
FP00023716,240,,,,,1,,,"The Sensorimotor Development Research Laboratory at Arizona State University in partnership with Theracycle and key stakeholders will complete a five-year product development project. The goal of this project is to develop and pilot test a pediatric version of a current specialized stationary bicycle that has a motor that can be turned on to deliver Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) in which the mechanical motor moves the pedals at least 35% faster than the participant can during voluntary cycling. Previous research with an adult version of this Assisted Cycle Therapy bicycle has shown improvements in some cognitive, motor, clinical, physical and mental health measures in adolescents and older adults with Down syndrome (DS) and other neurological disabilities. Thus, while results from ACT are promising in adult neurological populations, our research with adolescents with Down syndrome has encountered some physical limitations to the current cycle used for ACT. A model of ACT provides the theoretical framework and rationale for the use of ACT in which the faster rate of pedaling increases the sensory input, which increases the release of neurotrophic factors, which has been shown to lead to improved motor, cognitive and adaptive behaviors. Decreased feedback activation from slow movements may previously been limiting disabled populations development. ACT is a safe lower extremity paradigm to augment the voluntary movements of participants to assist them in safely achieving an exercise rate greater than their voluntary rate. However, we believe that ACT was previously limited in our younger participants because of the physical characteristics of the cycle built for adults. This technology will overcome the major obstacles to conventional pediatric exercise because it reduces some of the fear, low motivation/adherence and physical limitations of other exercise options (e.g., weight training, swimming, non-motorized cycling, etc.). There are two objectives: (1) to develop a pediatric version (ACT Early) of the current bicycle used for ACT by Theracycle with modifications and flexibility to adjust for shorter leg lengths, shorter arms and bodies of young children thus laying the foundation for more broad clinical applications and early interventions. (2) to pilot test the effectiveness of the pediatric Theracycle on 50 young children (7-10) with Down syndrome in a laboratory-based study. The innovative strategies utilized in this project lie in the mechanical motor in the bicycle, its importance for early intervention, and improvements in cognitive function which are so vital to independence in pediatric neurologic populations. Based on our previous research with several different adult neurological populations, our anticipated outcomes include improvements in executive function, fine and gross motor control, activities of daily living, clinical and adaptive behavior, and depression, among others. This early intervention will initially make children good students, citizens, and friends and will eventually improve inclusion and integration into society, employment, independent living and quality of life for people born with neurological disorders, specifically Down syndrome. The expected product is a safe, non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical, accessible, enjoyable, convenient, and eventually widespread clinical application of a pediatric version of the Theracycle which will deliver Assisted Cycle Therapy as an early intervention in many pediatric neurological populations.

Our model is that extensive sitting causes perturbations in multiple tissues via sub-optimal blood flow, which influence CVD risk biomarkers and extracellular vesicle (EV) alterations. Cellular communication is important for physiological and pathological responses, especially between cardiomyocytes (CMs), adipocytes (Ads), and endothelial cells (ECs). This study will leverage archival samples and data generated in the UCSD Go Red for Women SFRN Research Center Clinical Project (Arriba por la Vida Estudio, AVE study) and our Basic Project to evaluate causations between sitting behavior and CVD risk in postmenopausal Hispanic women. Integration of new and archival circulatingbiomarker data (leptin, etc), functional assays, and objectively measured sitting behavior will further elucidate novel mechanisms related to sitting time behavior change. Briefly, the AVE study randomized 254 postmenopausal Hispanic women, aged 55+ years, who spent at least 8 hours in sitting a posture per day and have BMI =25 kg/m2 into Intervention and Control Groups. Over a 3-month period, participants in the Intervention Group were coached to reduce their baseline total sitting time by 25%; participants in the Control Group received American Heart Association health advice. Our cross-sectional study demonstrated that the 5 CVD-associated microRNAs (miRs) in EC-derived EVs (EC-EVs) were altered by sitting time patterns. Building on our findings, we hypothesize that biomarkers associated with CVD risk, including bioactive and miR-containing EVs, adipokines, and cardiac health biomarkers, will be beneficially changed in Intervention vs. Control Group. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims using our archival biospecimens and data fromthe AVE study.Specific Aim 1. Assess the impact of reduced daily sitting time on CM- and Ad-relatedcirculating biomarkers for CVD risk among postmenopausal Hispanic women. We willmeasure circulating cardiomyokines (NT-pro-BNP, cTNI) and adipokines (high weightadiponectin, TNF- a) in all the plasma samples from our Basic Science Project.Specific Aim 2. Assess the impact of reduced daily sitting time on proportions of EC-,CM-, and Ad-EVs among postmenopausal Hispanic women. We will identify BestResponders (BRs) and Matched Controls (MCs) based on the objectively-measured sitting time among those participants and calculate the proportions of EC-, CM- and Ad-EVs in their plasma samples by measuring the actual numbers using NanoSight.Specific Aim 3. Assess the impact of reduced daily sitting time on miR profiles of EC-,CM-, and Ad-EVs among postmenopausal Hispanic women. We will immunoprecipitateCM-, and Ad-EVs of BRs from the plasma samples and apply for miR sequencing to explore the potential miRs-associated with daily sitting reduction. Specific Aim 4. Assess the impact of reduced daily sitting time on functions of EC-,CM-, and Ad-EVs on target tissues among postmenopausal Hispanic women. We willconduct (i) a state-of-the-art, multi-scale metabolic flux assay, (ii) transmission electronmicroscopy, (iii) inflammatory cytokine assays, and (iv) targeted gene expression analysis to investigate the effects of EC-, CM-, and Ad-EVs on mitochondria respiration and ultrastructure, cytokine secretions as well as target genes of miRs in CMs and ECs.",
FP00023753,242,,,,,1,,,"Summary (Routing)  Overview: This project will demonstrate a holistic wearable thermal and hydration management approach that enhances heat safety and overall productivity of individuals working in thermally challenging settings. The system will create future technology by integrating a new liquid cooling kirigami-garment (LCkG) with artificial intelligence-based wearable sensors that quantify the workers cooling and hydration needs based on work rate and physiologic responses. To prevent heat stress and dehydration, these sensor-based inputs trigger cooling of the garment and provide drinking cues to the user. The high-cooling capacity LCkG cools the worker by circulating water through vest-embedded tubes and re-chills the liquid in an ice-filled hydration bladder. To eliminate half of the weight carried by the workers, the water from melted ice is ingested based on physiologic sensor cues. In addition, vest weight will be reduced by 3-5x by replacing typically used rudimentary tubing with a kirigami-inspired stretchable, breathable, and conformal thin-film heat collector integrated with soft tubing. This technology will developed using a comprehensive evaluation scheme  that  includes  predictive-modeling,  lab-based  testing,  and  controlled  human  trials.  These improvements  may  allow  for  the  adoption  of  liquid-cooled  garments  beyond  niche  uses  to  common occupations such as agriculture and construction. The way this technology augments future workers safety and performance will be investigated through a series of field-trials on a mid-sized Phoenix valley farm. This real-time assessment and rapid management of an individuals cooling and hydration needs are a major advancement over the current one-approach-for-all heat illness prevention practices. Current regulations are insufficient to prevent heat stress for some heat-sensitive workers, but they force others to stop working unnecessarily. Field-trial results will inform technology development, and enable assessment of the impact of smart cooling and hydration systems on future  work  in  hot  conditions.  Specifically,  a  series  of  focus  groups  among  the  farmers  will  elucidate perceived barriers to adoption of the wearables and to what degree this adoption could mitigate economic losses associated with current and future heat extremes. Intellectual Merit: At the technology frontier, this work will advance fundamental knowledge concerning soft-soft material thermal contact resistance, thermo-mechanical behavior of heterogeneous meta-materials, and design of soft heat exchangers and its application in human heat-stress management. These efforts will yield currently unavailable physics-based analytical and numerical sub-models that will be integrated into predictive-models of the novel LCkG, which will be validated using systematic bench-top approaches, a thermal manikin, and small-scale lab-based human testing. Integrating this new complex understanding will match material and device architecture with desired, high performance cooling garment characteristics, including total thermal resistance and effective modulus.   At the human-scale, novel understanding of real-world, field-level insights into technological application for specific health, productivity, and economic improvements will move effective solutions forward. This work will generate new understanding of the use of real-time individual physiologic data to augment natural thermoregulation using liquid-cooling and hydration during labor-intensive farm work in hot conditions, as well as associated thermal safety and worker productivity changes. Such work is a substantial advancement of  knowledge  in  real-world  settings.  Further,  new  use-inspired  knowledge  will  be  gained  concerning perceived comfort, behavior, and social barriers that adoption of wearable sensor and cooling technologies may face in agricultural settings, as well as improvements the system could bring outdoor work in Arizona and numerous hot regions across the U.S.  Broader Impacts: This research enhances worker health, availability, and economic well-being; addresses injury, illness, and symptom management related to extreme heat; generates new use-inspired data for occupational health and safety; creates predictive models and materials that benefit other applications, such as haptics and soft robotics; and trains numerous graduate and undergraduate students in cross-cutting topics. The high-performance cooling system augments natural thermoregulation to significantly advance current one-approach-fits-all heat-illness prevention methods, and could considerably improve worker safety and effectiveness. Further, field-trials with 45 farmworkers will provide education on heat stress prevention  as  well  as  insights  into  their  personal  responses  during  work  in  the  heat  (via  wearable measurements). If implemented widely, the proposed system will address the needs of millions of workers for  occupational  health  and  safety,  such  as  agriculture  and  construction,  worldwide.  These  scientific breakthroughs  can  specifically  lower  illnesses  and  injury  (and  potentially  death)  and  mitigate  reduced productivity  and  associated  economic  losses.  These  societal  problems  are  exacerbated  by  dehydration, which is common in outdoor workers, and distinctively investigated herein. Lastly, Arizona is a testbed for coping with heat extremes, and if proven here, the novel adaptation pathways might apply in other regions that are increasingly facing heat related issues. ",

FP00023775,244,,,,,1,,,"Abstract Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer death. CT screening can significantly reduce LC mortality; however, it suffers from high false positive rate. Our overarching goal is to identify biochemical biomarkers that can differentiate LC from subjects with benign nodules detected by CT screening and reduce unnecessary invasive work up procedures.  Cancers attributable to infections have a greater incidence than any individual type of cancer. Microbial infection elicits complex immune responses. The humoral immune response leads to the production of anti-microbial antibodies (AMAb). AMAbs demonstrate not only exposure but also the host physiological state and a functional immunological interaction with the host and serve as a logbook of a persons infection history. Lung is constantly exposed to the environment. LC development is influenced by it distinct and rich microbiota. An increased risk of developing LC is associated with a history of previous lung diseases, most of which have strong connections with infections. Microbial infection is a common cause of pulmonary nodules. We hypothesize that LC patients and benign nodule controls exhibit different AMAb profiles. To the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic studies on the AMAb responses in LC patients. We are proposing an immunoproteomics study that complements existing sequencing studies and hypothesize that a proteome-scale, comprehensive study of the humoral immune response against INDIVIDUAL viral and bacterial and fungal proteins will yield specific antibody biomarkers that can make an impact on patient management.  Protein microarrays provide a multiplexed, high-throughput platform to profile host antibody immune responses against thousands of proteins in parallel. We will develop a lung centric microbial protein arrays displaying more than ~12,000 proteins with an emphasis on microorganisms reported to be associated to LC and lung diseases and our own metagenomics analysis of tumor tissues. AMAb biomarkers will be identified using samples collected from LC and benign nodule controls. Another main goal is to decipher the microbial link to LC. We will also profile a subset of LC patients with samples collected prior to and at the time of diagnosis to understand how AMAbs change during the last phase of LC development. For a subset of cancer patients, we will also analyze the microbial composition in their tumor and paired neighboring normal tissues, tumor gene expression, and cancer gene mutation analysis. Together with our comprehensive AMAb profiles, we will perform an integrated multi-omic analysis to build rich, multiscale network models that capture important causal relationships relevant to understanding disease.   Our research team comprises experts on disease proteomics, pulmonologist, statisticians, and bioinformatians. High quality samples with detailed clinical information are available for this study. Thus, we can ensure technical excellence to solve clinically important questions. Improved knowledge of the link between infectious agents and LC may help identify cancer diagnostics, manage risks and develop vaccine and prevention strategies. ",
FP00023788,245,,,,,1,,,"  PROJECT SUMMARY  Overview. This project proposes to develop a model of ethics education for lab-based research that brings technical dimensions of scientific work into a more integral and generative relation with its ethical dimensions. Drawing on traditions of ethical formation tied to notions of craftsmanship, it recasts technical work as more than the scene of potential misconduct, viewing it instead as the very means by which researchers can pursue growth in integrity. It does this by adopting well-established strategies, developed in non-STEM settings, by which craft work is reimagined as soul workthe idea that skilled labor, and the material integrity it demands, can be a means of ethical enrichment. By bringing together scientists and ethicists from multiple moral traditions, this project seeks to adapt older ideals of craft-work as soul-work for contemporary laboratory life. This approach invites not only a different view of ethics, but a different view of science, one in which researchers seek to imbue the material demands of experimental practice with renewed purpose and intention to create a space of ethical formation. This model is oriented by the proposition that ethics for STEM must be more than a supplement to technical training. Ethics must seek more than the avoidance of bad behavior. It must foster growth in ethical capacity leading to resilience and integrity. The dominant social ethos shaping researchers today no longer favors integrity: the resources needed to maintain a competitive advantage, coupled with the drive to translate even preliminary findings, generates a situation in which small ethical compromises can accrue to the overall deterioration of science. Scientists and ethicists must work against these forces by collaboratively reimagining the ethical culture of laboratory life as one that buffers aspiring researchers against the external pressures and inner inclinations that might compromise scientific integrity. Through retreats, presentations, and sustained interaction within and across three neuroscience labs, we will learn about and experiment with, multiple traditional approaches to craft-work as soul-work. Initially, we will draw insight from two classical maxims of monastic practiceora et labora (reflection and work) and work-practice. One from Europe, the other from Southeast Asia, the maxims aim at the same goal: to help the scientist become the person she aspires by connecting her daily work in the lab (pipetting, observing, etc.) with her ethical aspirations. This approach refuses to externalize ethics from science, i.e., to treat it as a supplement to the real goal of technical success. Instead, it revitalizes an older view of science, in which the lab, like the monastery, provides a setting where rhythms of skilled labor become the medium for ethical growth. Intellectual Merit. This project builds on prior efforts to connect the social study of science and technology to new strategies for ethics education. Emphasizing notions of co-production and collaboration, these prior efforts have sought to constructively engage cultures of ethics as they take shape within the daily activities of lab-based research. This proposed project updates that goal by connecting ethics education for STEM to the now substantial body of work on the ethics of craftwork. By giving contemporary form to non-traditional and non-Western strategies of ethical practice, the expectation is that scientists will be better equipped to resist and even transform the forces that might work against scientific and ethical integrity, thereby generating a richer experience of technical work itself. Broader Impacts. The model proposed here reimagines the role of ethics training by flipping ethics from an external force acting on science, to the embodied formation of character through the material rhythms of laboratory life. It resists efforts to compartmentalize ethics and science, taking such efforts to be  unrealistic and ultimately harmful. Such compartmentalization, it argues, reinforces a dehumanizing dynamic by way of which researchers sense of ethical personhood is cordoned off from technical practice (its just work). Yet researchers are only human: they continue to pour their hopes, dreams, and identities into their work. The proposed model takes that social fact seriously by refusing to treat ethics as an add-on to technical proficiency. The impact of this approach, if successful, will be to awaken researchers to the potential of technical practice as a means of ethical enrichment leading to a more integrated experience of the scientific life, one that will redound to integrity in cultures of scientific practice more broadly.

FP00023789,246,,,,,1,,,"Microbiomes directly impact health, behavioral and cognitive traits of their hosts and offer adaptive potential to novel environments and lifestyles. Hence, understanding phenotypic expression of any individual trait requires knowledge of combined functioning of host and its associated microbial genomes (hologenome). Previous studies of host-microbiome interactions have largely focused on cataloguing microbial diversity, whereas better understanding of mechanisms that maintain communication among microbiome, host and environment for adaptive evolution of a holobiont is limited. Here we propose to use a novel model system to address mechanisms of microbiome assembly and study molecular dynamics of co-evolutionary mechanisms in hosts, their gut microbiome and the respective environment.In natural systems, few (if any) environmental drivers are binary and organismal responses are often guided by correlated factors associated with ecological gradients (ref). Latitudinal gradients are among the best studied natural laboratories to infer species response to environmental factors (ref). Altitudinal gradients, although studied relatively less extensively, offer clear benefits, such as providing replicates to test for generality of underlying cause(s), potential for manipulative experiments and ease of data collection that occur at the scale of planet over a short vertical gradient (ref). In this study, we aim to utilize the extensive altitudinal gradient of the Himalayas (200 m to >8000 m) to explore gut microbiomes of related animals along an environmental gradient to dissect out the importance of key mechanisms such as dispersal, environmental selection, drift, and adaptation in shaping up holobionts and their hologenomes.Community assembly is fundamental to many systems; here, we use community ecological theory to address the overarching question: What mechanisms govern assembly, temporal stability, and resilience of microbial communities in animal guts? From the hosts perspective, microbiomes shape physiological and reproductive phenotypes (ref) but whether or not community assembly matters to the host and if they influence microbiome-driven host evolution is understudied and forms the basis for our other overarching question: Does the microbiome assembly matter to the host?These are fundamental, common questions that we will pose in a unique system that provides clear advantages for exposing underlying mechanisms. We will study Pika (order Lagomorpha), altitudinal gradient specialists that play a key role in alpine ecosystem function (ref). Because high altitude is associated with environmental stress, such as cold climate, low oxygen and high UV radiation, the underlying processes of gut microbiota assembly are hypothesized to vary among Pikas adapted to various altitudes. As Pikas are mammals whose gut is considered sterile at birth (ref), they acquire microbes via horizontal and vertical transmission, hence providing an ideal model for studying the effect of host trait and environment of Pika gut microbiota composition. In addition, unique behaviors exist in Pika feeding such haypiling (drying and storing own vegetation) and cecatrophy (re-ingestion of cecal pellets) that may modulate crucial gut microbiota that would otherwise be lost; importantly, these behaviors vary among populations (ref). By examining pikas along an environmental gradient (altitude), this project will investigate mechanisms of host-microbiome interactions and their role in co-adaptation to novel environments. We propose two hypotheses,Hypothesis 1: The relative roles of selective and non-selective processes (dispersal, community drift) in microbiome community assembly vary among animal populations at different altitudes in response to differences in local conditions such as environmental stress and food resourcesHypothesis 2: Host genome co-vary across populations with traits in the microbiome and host genetic pathways are critical in maintaining essential microbial functions.",

SPECIFIC AIMS: Globally, climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of wildfires.  These disasters produce complex mixtures of inhaled pollutants that can not only damage the lungs but also promote systemic health effects.

Circulating peptide fragments arise from activated proteases in the lungfollowing inhalation of particulate and gaseous toxicants.10 These peptides retain 2 structure and act throughligand-receptor endothelial interactions to compromise BBB integrity and promote inflammation (Figure 1).Our laboratory and others have demonstrated that advanced age confers vulnerability to many of theneuroinflammatory and vascular outcomes of inhaled toxicants.1,14 However, gaps remain in ourunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms of aging  environment interactions that compromise theneurological and cardiovascular healthspan. Furthermore, how environmental exposures promote agingprocesses remains understudied, especially in terms of high-concentration insults as seen in wildfire scenarios.We hypothesize that inhaled wildfire smoke (WFS)-related pollutants accelerate vascular and neurologicalaging by augmenting circulatory factors that 1) compromise BBB integrity to induce chronic neuroinflammation,and 2) promote a reduced metabolic, senescent cellular phenotype that may be treatable with combined antiinflammatory and NAD+ boosting compounds. The following aims will test this hypothesis:AIM 1. Assess interaction between WFS exposure-induced and aging-related circulatory changes asdrivers of BBB impairment and neuroinflammation. Serum proteomic/peptidomic compositional changescaused by aging x WFS exposure will be paired with in vivo histopathology and functional ex vivo outcomes(inflammatory potential, TEER). Persistence of serum compositional/bioactivity changes and the causallinkage to inflammatory outcomes from early life WFS exposures will be assessed.AIM 2. Delineate the role of cerebrovascular endothelial cell receptors as intermediates in WFSinduced neuroinflammation. Using genetic mouse models, we will selectively examine the roles of CD36, which is clearly involved in acute responses of the BBB to inhaled toxicants, and VCAM-1, which has been recently implicated as a mediator of aging-related neurological sequelae. In addition to better understanding the pathological mechanisms linking inhaled WFS, this aim will identify potential long-term therapeutic targets.AIM 3. Pharmacologically attenuate accelerated aging from WFS exposure using either A) sirtuin-1 activator (resveratrol) and an NAD+ booster (NMN) and/or B) a senolytic cocktail to reduce agingrelated circulating factors. These permutations will target the key drivers of circulatory changes from WFS exposure and aging to reduce senescence-related inflammation in the brain and vasculature, improve cellular metabolism, and promote a healthier phenotype. Simulated WFS will be derived from common biomass fuels of the Southwestern U.S., with control/ characterization of size, concentration and composition of exposures. Our team is experienced with wood smoke exposures, comprehensive multi-system, multi-omic characterizations of toxicological responses, and research into aging as a susceptibility factor for environmental stressors. This application responds to PA-19- 249: Environmental Influences on Aging: Effects of Extreme Weather and Disaster Events on Aging Processes, using an integrative approach to understand how WFS exposures across the lifespan ultimately promote detrimental cellular and organismal aging.",

Melvin Supervisory Grants Management Specialist & Deputy Chief Grants Management Officer National Institute on Aging Grants and Contracts Management Branch Gateway Building, Suite 2W121 7201 Wisconsin Avenue Bethesda, MD 20892-9205  Re:  5 P01 AG052352-05  Project Title: Sedentary Behavior Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Dear Mr. Melvin, We are requesting a 12-month extension of year 4 to spend down some of the current carryforward. Substantial initial budget cuts to our grant (18-26% across Years 1-5) caused our team to carefully manage and conservatively spend our funds while preserving the scientific integrity and innovation of our project. In addition to our intentional conservation of funds from the start because of budget cuts, we have had an unobligated balance since our Year 1 RPPR due to:  1)  Initial recruitment delays caused by delayed IRB approval. 2)  Some unexpected staff transitions including Dr. Dorothy Sears accepting a new faculty position at Arizona State University in year 3, unpaid medical leaves for two full-time employees in years 2 and 3, and temporary voluntary reductions in effort for two full-time employees due to personal reasons in years 3  4. 3)  Temporary pauses (totaling about 7 months) in study enrollment & data collection for Project 1 and Project 2 due to COVID-19. 4)  Inability to hire additional in-person staff as planned in year 4 due to on-campus personnel restrictions due to COVID-19. In an extended 12-month year 4, we would be able to spend the carryforward balances as follows: 1)  Personnel salary & benefits for additional staff including:  a.  Staff at Arizona State University (ASU) which has been established as a secondary study location for P1 recruitment, enrollment, and data collection. b.  Continued 100% effort for a Research Assistant / Lab Assistant (Y. Avitia) to assist with P1 at UC San Diego and to manage biospecimens for P1 and P2. c.  Continued effort for 2 part-time graduate students (B. Schumacher and R. Chen) and a full-time staff (B. Anuskiewicz, start date July 11, 2021) to expedite data analysis and paper writing. d.  A part-time graduate research assistant to help with P2 implementation activities (start date 10/2021). e.  Continued effort for a research scientist to assist with data interpretation and manuscript preparation f.  Continued effort for 2 part-time biostatisticians to prepare models for final analysis, assist with data cleaning & QCing, and paper writing (L. Liu and F. Tuz-Zahra). g.  Part-time effort for a phlebotomist to supplement current phlebotomy services at the ACTRI and MCC. (A. Shadyab).  2)  Increased participant costs at the Altman Clinical Translation Research Institute for clinic visits to complete data collection at UC San Diego. The costs of clinic services (phlebotomy, blood processing, nursing, ultrasound, room) for Project 1 and Project 2 increased effective 1/1/2020. 3)  Continued recruitment expenses for P1 & P2: In order to meet our P1 and P2 enrollment goals for the study, we have developed a robust recruitment plan that launched in February 2021 once some COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and the vaccine became available for our staff and community members. Our recruitment strategy includes additional paid advertising, mass mailings to local women through our marketing lists and UCSD patient lists, and additional social media advertising. Our NOA-revised Year 5 planned budget provides less than $5K in printing and materials geared solely for recruitment. We appreciate your consideration of this projected timeline. We do want to communicate that we are committed and optimistic about completing all of our proposed P01 goals so long as we have access to this critical carryforward balance.

FP00023899_Rev3,252,,,,,1,,,"Statement of Work (Revised)  ASU GR38010Dorothy Sears, PhD, Subcontract Principal Investigator, Professor of Nutrition in the College ofHealth Solutions, is an expert in sitting time-associated cardiometabolic disease and agingresearch and putative mechanisms. She has extensive experience studying molecular,physiological, and behavioral factors involved in cardiometabolic disease mechanisms and risk.She is a member of the Metabolic Translational Team in the ASU College of Health Solutionsand has been a member of the UCSD Moores Cancer Center, Diabetes Research Center andCenter for Circadian Biology Executive Committee for years. She is an expert in evaluatingstandard and novel biomarkers associated with prolonged sitting time and cardiometabolicdisease risk.Dr. Sears originally conceived of and wrote Project 1 (Sedentary Behavior Interrupted: Arandomized crossover trial of acute effects on biomarkers of healthy aging in the laboratory,aka Rise for Health) of the P01 AG052352 grant proposal that lead to the UCSD SedentaryTime and Aging Research (STAR) Program, funded by the NIH National Institute of Aging. Shehas been the Project 1 PI and the Biospecimens Lead for Project 2 since 2018, based at UCSDprior to and during this subaward. She was PI of a pilot study that informed the Project 1 design.Kerr J, Crist K, Vital DG, Dillon L, Aden SA, Trivedi M, Castellanos LR, Godbole S, Li H,Allison MA, Khemlina GL, Takemoto ML, Schenk S, Sallis JF, Grace M, Dunstan DW,Natarajan L, LaCroix AZ, Sears DD.

PLOS ONE. 2017 Nov 30;12(11):e0188544. PMID: 29190761.She will provide her relevant expertise related to executive leadership, clinical protocol designand execution, and relevant biomarkers of sitting time-associated cardiometabolic disease andhealthy aging in postmenopausal women. Given her experience designing and completingclinical studies, and evaluating large-scale data research studies, she is well-prepared for herrole as a subcontract PI for the proposed study, which is simply a continuation of her originalleadership position started while at UCSD. She will provide executive and scientific leadership,provide oversight of clinical laboratory activities, recruitment/enrollment, executiveresponsibilities of reporting (Progress Reports, DSMB Reporting, IRB), direct allbiospecimen/biomarker analyses, data analysis and interpretation, lead preparation and serveas corresponding author on all manuscripts generated from the project, and assuredissemination of findings.Starting on March 1, 2021, Dr. Sears will lead an ASU-based team and study site in addition toleading the UCSD-based team. At ASU, she will supervise a study coordinator and multiplestudent workers and volunteers. She will also coordinate ASU site activities with staff at theCollege of Health Solutions Clinical and Community Clinical Research Hub and TranslationalResearch Laboratory, located in the 850 PBC Building adjacent to her office and wet lab space.The budget period of this subaward, and Year 5 of the parent P01 award at UCSD, has beenamended to extend through May 31, 2023. Dr. Sears and the ASU team will enroll 19 studyparticipants, conduct all the primary outcome insulin and glucose biomarkers assays (Projects 1and 2 of the STAR Program) and conduct all the Project 1 Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) dataanalyses using plasma biospecimens and FMD video files, respectively, collected at both UCSDand ASU sites. Dr. Sears and team will submit resulting data files securely to the UCSD teamdatabase managers and statisticians. Approximately 4,400 plasma samples will be included inthe measurement of insulin and glucose concentration (79% of these from Project 1). This number includes individual participant samples and quality control samples. Approximately 420 FMD video files will be analyzed to determine percent dilation and across-visit ratios of postcondition/pre-condition dilation percentages.Dr. Sears will reside in Phoenix, AZ and work on-site at UCSD for approximately 2 weekdaysper month for research activities and meetings with the research team. She will participate in biweekly P01 leadership Zoom/in-person meetings, weekly (& as needed) meetings with the ASU based team, and bi-weekly Zoom/in-person meetings with the UCSD-based team. She will also have 1-on-1 meetings as needed with Lindsay Dillon (Program Coordinator, UCSD) by phone, Zoom, or in-person. She will connect with Dr. Castellanos (UCSD co-investigator on Project 1) and the UCSD CTRI clinic staff by phone, Zoom, and email, as needed. She will organize and participate in other Zoom and telephone meetings as needed for writing group activities and data/statistics discussions.",
FP00023914,253,,,,,1,,," EXECUTIVE SUMMARY          PROJECT TITLE:   Blockchain-Based System for Inventory and Traceability with Application in Medical Device Supply Chain Management.        PROJECT PI(S) & AFFILIATION(S): Dr Dragan BOSCOVIC, Research Professor, CIDSE; Dr. Adela GRANDO, Assistant Professor, CHS.  DESCRIPTION: Safety and security of medical devices and supplies (including implanted cardiac pacemakers and medication pumps) are extremely important, given that devices can be compromised and controlled. Also, there is a need to reduce response times when recalls and field notices are issued by device manufactures and regulators. Blockchain enabled distributed registries offer the potential to address those issues.   In current supply chain, the traceability of medical devices is hardly efficient and is not perceived to be trustworthy for all parties. Various implant and counterfeit scandals have revealed that the risk is unfortunately borne by the patients. The transaction steps in the supply chain are stored in the blockchain in an unchangeable way and it is helped by the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR),requiring that each medical devices will always have to have a Unique Device Identification (UDI) number to enable provenance and tracking. This allows each medical device to be uniquely identified in the supply chain and track the transaction steps.  This collaboration will leverage on the expertise of ASU as blockchain solution developer and the extensive record of Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD)as a leader on the production of secure, scalable and robust medical devices. BD is a medical technology company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents.  The company's customers include health care institutions, science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry, and the general public. All three business segments of BD, namely a) Medical, b) Life Sciences and c) Interventional are to benefit from a blockchain-based device tracking and inventory management.  EXPERIMENTAL PLAN:  The project will use permissioned Distributed Ledger Technology (DTL)  in order to create distributed medical device registries with the goal of improving patient safety, cyber security and response times in supply chain. It will enable digital integration of medical device records across the participating supply chain companies and test feasibility of effective device tracking and remote inventory management.  BD will introduce trusted partners into the experiment which will in turn tested whether or not blockchain-based infrastructure allows the parties to place medical device orders without transaction intermediaries or direct connection. Furthermore, the experiments will test the technological and regulatory means to implement this vision for improved patient safety.  BENCHMARK ANALYSIS  REVIEW OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES Including patents, commercial products, & related work in Blocchain.     1 | Page AZ Blockchain applied Research Center Engineering        There are many journal articles on blockchain technology of which the most famous is the original paper by  Satoshi Nakamoto.  Blockchain technology is sometimes termed as Blueprint for New Economy. In terms of IPRs this is still a nascent field and patent filings are relatively uncommon.  Swiss hospitals have recently completed their trial of blockchain tracking of medical devices, The data assets included all message formats required for the transaction in accordance with the GS1 standard (Switzerland: GS1 FG BiG Switzerland Ideal Message Healthcare, EDI 3.1 XML), which is aimed at in the healthcare sector. The Blockchain used in this successful trial was a permissioned blockchain based on Hyperledger technology, and this project will use the same blockchain standard.

The strong interest in Blockchain stems from its central attributes that provide security, anonymity and data integrity in a trustless manner (no third party organization is needed to control/verify the transactions). As such, it provides fertile research grounds, especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations.  Although launched into prominence by Bitcoin, the blockchain technology behind it could prove to be much more significant. Some go that far to claim that the blockchain is in position to become the fifth disruptive computing paradigm after mainframes, PCs, the Internet, and mobile/social networking. The blockchain is essentially a public ledger with potential to act as a worldwide, decentralized record for the registration, inventory, and transfer of all assetsnot just finances, but property and intangible assets such as votes, software, health data, and ideas.   A PubMed query run in June 2018 using the keyword blockchain retrieved 40 indexed papers. The same query run in March 2020 retrieved 251 papers. This reflects a growing interest in blockchain in medical informatics. Based on a scoping review by Boulos et al.1, blockchain solutions are being explored for: (1) securing patient and provider identities; (2) managing pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains; (3) clinical research and data monetization; (4) medical fraud detection; (5) public health surveillance; (6) enabling truly public and open geo-tagged data; (7) powering many Internet of Things-connected autonomous devices, wearables, drones and vehicles, via the distributed peer-to-peer apps they run, to deliver the full vision of smart healthy cities and regions; and (8) blockchain enabled augmented reality in crisis mapping and recovery scenarios, including mechanisms for validating, crediting and rewarding crowdsourced geo-tagged data.  According to Boulos et al. managing pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains is a very promising and growing areas of application of blockchain technology. This interest is driven by the need to reduce response times when recalls and field notices are issued by device manufactures and regulators. Safety and security of medical devices and supplies are also extremely important, given that devices can be compromised and controlled. There are multiple examples of that. For instance, almost half million of patients wearing implantable cardiac pacemakers were identified as needing a vital firmware update due to a security flaw exposing their device to potential   1 Kamel Boulos et al. Int J Health Geogr (2018) 17:25    AZ Blockchain applied Research Center Engineering         4 | Page    PROJECT NARRATIVE  PAGE 2 of 3  manipulation by hackers2. Other example includes the recall of the SumbiqTM infusion system, when it was found that Hospiras smart pumps could be accessed and controlled by unauthorized users to change patients dosages3.   Blockchain, in combination with the requirements by the FDA and EU for medical devices to have a Unique Device Identifier (UDI), has the potential to reduce cost, improve patient safety and combat medical device fraud. The use of blockchain could help with keeping track and issuing firmware updates via deployment of automated smart contracts. Device tracking has the potential to improve safety and efficiency of medical devices through more responsive device recalls and issued notices. Blockchain medical device tracking also can utilize immutability to prevent device lost, theft and any other sort of malicious tampering.   In this area, there are several R&D questions that need to be addressed: 1) Can blockchain systems efficiently and effectively support de-centralized medical device tracking and inventory? 2) Can blockchain-based systems reduce response times when recalls and field notices are issued by device manufactures and regulators? 3) Can blockchain-based systems increase the safety and security of medical devices and supplies?        2 https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/firmware-update-address-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-identified-abbotts-formerly-st-jude-medicals 3 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hospira-fda-cybersecurity/fda-warns-of-security-flaw-in-hospira-infusion-pumps-idUSKCN0Q52GJ20150731      AZ Blockchain applied Research Center Engineering      5 | Page PI CV  (2 page max for each PI) DRAGAN M.

Aggregate Signatures for the Blockchain: A Study for DASH:Aggregate signatures hold the promise to improve the space efficiency and possibly the performance of signature verification for blockchain operations. Instead of generating separate individual signature for different transactions or messages, aggregate signatures allow the combination of separate signatures into one, thereby reducing the space requirement to store these signatures. Given the significant storage requirement for signatures in a blockchain setting, the use of aggregate signature could significantly reduce the storage requirements for signatures. More generally, aggregate signatures are clearly attractive in settings in which storage space and communication bandwidth are at a premium compared to computation. What is not as clear is whether aggregate signatures can also compete in their computation requirements with digital signature algorithms currently in use. The adoption of aggregate signatures is already making headway with the standardization efforts of BLS-based aggregate signatures. In a cryptocurrency like Dash, aggregate signatures can potentially reduce both storage and computation requirements depending on the particular use scenario and the associated scenario-specific optimizations deployed. For example, Long Living Masternode Quorums (LLMQs) are currently used in the implementation of the InstantSend feature with plans to support other features. The use of BLS signatures to propagate quorum consensus decisions to the rest of the network decreases the communication load on the rest of the network but the computation and communication load on the quorum nodes is relatively high especially for large quorums. It is conceivable that the high load on quorum nodes can be further reduced through hierarchical aggregations, the use of short multi-signatures (through public key aggregation as proposed by Boneh et al. in Compact Multi-Signatures for Smaller Blockchains ASIACRYPT 2018), or identity-based aggregate signatures (as proposed by Gentry and Ramzan in the International workshop on public key cryptography, 2006). The key objectives are as follows:Identify performance measures to evaluate aggregate signaturesSurvey existing signature aggregation schemes proposed to improve blockchain performance. Survey proposed applications of aggregate signatures Evaluate the storage and computation performance of BLS signatures and the possibility of taking advantage of parallelization for improved computation performance.Develop optimization techniques for the use of aggregate signatures in quorums with particular emphasis on Dash LLMQ system.MILESTONES Identify efforts and proposals for the use of aggregate signatures in the industry m1Survey existing aggregate signature schemes m4Survey proposed applications of aggregate signatures m5Develop optimizations techniques for the use of aggregate signatures in quorums m9Evaluate the storage and computation performance of BLS-based aggregate signatures m12BUDGET AND SPENDING PLAN:Budget 50KOne MS or PHD student for one semester, Fall 2022.

Meta X FashionChain There are three categories of communities in the fashion domain that Meta X FashionChain addresses: fashion designers, fashion producers, and fashion consumers. Until now, there has not been a singular, unifying ecosystem that supports the fashion design and product process at scale; sustainably; and transparently. The lack of a user-friendly and intuitive UX experience in fashion supply chain applications using blockchain has also hindered the adoption of the technology in the fashion domain. Online product verification  The Meta X FashionChain protocol will enable fashion retailers and designers to verify the authenticity of items they sell to consumers. Fashion pieces can be assigned a unique ID signature with a third-party verification application. Customers wishing to verify the authenticity of their pieces can log onto the Meta X FashionChain application and input their unique one-time-use hashes generated from their garments ID to find about the details associated with the item, such as provenance and product journey.Physical Signing NFC and RFID chips  As well as barcodes and QR codes will be compatible with the Meta X FashionChain protocol. Unique ID signatures generated from the protocol can be stored into a physical marker and attached to a fashion item. As the product moves across the supply chain, every party handling the piece can verify its source via an application on the Meta X FashionChain protocol and register details and receive updates real-time. Consumers can also scan RFID hardware to track the movement of the product along the supply chain.Sustainability & Ethical labour seal  Will provide legitimacy and proof that fashion designers are engaging in sustainable and ethical fashion production practices.YEAR 3Goal: Develop an omnichain interoperability protocol that allows for cross-chain decentralized exchange service for fashion blockchain assets between the metaverse and physical worlds. This interoperability protocol will allow NFTs to be exchanged between chains through cross-chain bridge between fashion ecosystems.Financial commitment from industry combined with matching funds from the State of Arizona will be used solely for the purpose of conducting blockchain research.

All subjects will receive standard behavioral support for smoking cessation during the study. Subjects are to be randomized to one of three arms A, B, or C, where the intended interventions are placebo for 12 weeks plus behavioral support (Arm A), 3 mg cytisinicline TID for 6 weeks followed by placebo for 6 weeks plus behavioral support (Arm B), and 3 mg cytisinicline TID for 12 weeks plus behavioral support (Arm C). The primary outcome measure is abstinence during the last 4 weeks of cytisinicline treatment compared to the placebo arm (Weeks 3-6 for comparison of Arm B vs Arm A; Weeks 9-12 for comparison of Arm C vs Arm A). The secondary outcome measure is abstinence continuing to Week 24 post randomization in the cytisinicline arms compared to the placebo arm (Weeks 6-24 for comparison of Arm B vs Arm A; Weeks 12-24 for comparison of Arm C vs Arm A). If the primary outcome of abstinence is significant for both 6 and 12 weeks of cytisinicline treatment, reduction in risk of relapse for those subjects achieving abstinence within a Week 3-6 period will be compared in Arm C vs Arm B from Week 7 to Week 24.  In addition, the study will compare the safety profiles of 3 mg TID dosing for 6 weeks (Arm B) and 12 weeks (Arm C), relative to placebo (Arm A).",
FP00023966,256,,,,,1,,,"FW-HTF-P: The Future of Workplace Wellness                                                                                                                                                                Workplace wellness programs are on the rise. In a recent report by the US Chamber ofCommerce, it was reported that a large majority (87 percent) of employers are committed to  workplace wellness, and 73 percent offer a wellness program, and more than 60 percent ofemployers said workplace wellness programs reduced their organizations health care costs. Further, studies show that well-designed wellness programs have a return on investment of  $1.50 to $3 per dollar spent over a two- to nine-year timeframe.   However, workplace wellness programs often require one on one sessions with a wellness coach, uses very little automation, and does not scale well for future corporate needs. Digital enabled health coaching is still in its infancy; with the most commonly used feature being the chat feature.   There is a significant argument for using artificial intelligence to address the growing need for scaling wellness practices. This involves a comprehensive design approach to workspacebehavior change, with expertise spanning industrial design, sensors, AI, and mixed-media based biofeedback methods to help create a wide variety of useful, scalable, and economical  interventions. For instance, continuous sensing using wearables can lead to insights withmeasures of subject activity and exercise routines to significantly improve personalized wellness protocols. AI methods can help convert low-grade sensor data, such as from accelerometers, to surrogates of clinically relevant movement features that correlate with therapist impressions.  New ergonomic designs of workspaces for home and workplace use, with wellness relevantinstrumentation can lead to higher compliance with wellness recommendations. Biofeedback using art-based ambient auditory and haptic-based methods can lead to systems for long-term  joyful engagement with wellness.   At the same time, wellness practitioners need to participate in the design and development of  technology solutions; not just to understand how they work, but to appreciate their strengths andweaknesses, and help structure their development in close collaboration with designers and technologists. This will ensure the future corporate wellness programs are based on experience-based knowledge of human behavior and health.  Vision: The future of workplace wellness is embedded, engaging, empowering, and economical -- embedded into daily routines, empowering via AI enabled insights heretofore unavailable,   engaging via powerful art-based feedback approaches, and made economical by acomprehensive design approach spanning sensors, algorithms, product and industrial design. Our long-term research trajectory is to study how the practice of workplace wellness will be revolutionized due to advances in AI and sensor technologies.

FP00024054,261,,,,,1,,,"Specific Aims & Approach 03.04.20 The evidence for the superiority of non-pharmacologic therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and other behavioral approaches in patients with chronic pain is well-established. Unfortunately, most patients with chronic pain are only seen in under-resourced primary care settings and rarely have access to evidence-based chronic pain care. The current opioid epidemic is one consequence of this reality.  The purpose of this grant proposal is NOT to study the effectiveness of another psychosocial treatment intervention. Rather, it is to test a Delivery System Intervention of a pragmatic program that could be widely adopted in many primary care settings, the Improving Chronic Pain Care in Primary Care (I-PC2) program. This program will prepare behavioral health providers (BHPs) who are co-located within primary care teams to meet the behavioral health care needs of patients with chronic pain through an innovative evidence-based behavioral health provider chronic pain training program. The skills acquired through this training will be implemented and applied to patient care through a team-based model of clinic redesign and quality improvement for chronic pain, the Six Building Blocks (6BB) program. Although originally designed for improving opioid medication management, more recently the 6BBs have been used to improve care for patients with chronic pain who are not on opioids. The overall design of this program has its roots in the Chronic Care Model (CCM): the IBH component will result in informed activated patients who are cared for by a prepared proactive care team created by the 6BB program. What makes this program practical is that many, if not most primary care clinics already have an integrating a behavioral health care provider. (BHP) However, few have operationalized the management of chronic pain into this role and most BHPs are not adequately prepared to care for these patients. The overall intervention approach will be informed by the widely used Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework. The assessment and analyses will be guided by the RE-AIM framework. For the UH3 phase of this proposal our Specific Aims are to: 1.  Support and evaluate the implementation of the I-PC2 program in 28 primary care clinic locations across 4 health care systems. (Adoption and Implementation.) 2.  Compare changes in a) patient-reported chronic pain outcome scores, and b) opioid prescribing between intervention and control clinics. (Reach & Effectiveness)  3.  Conduct a mixed-methods assessment of sustainers and non-sustainers of the program. (Maintenance) We will accomplish these aims by conducting a Hybrid Type 2 cluster randomized trial in the UH3 phase (Years 2-5) of this proposal. This is an appropriate study design because it allows for both an rigorous assessment of a delivery system intervention AND addresses an important implementation science question concerning sustainment. A total of 28 primary care clinics across 4 health care systems will be randomized to an Initial Intervention (n=14) or Delayed Intervention (n=14) group. For each group, implementation will be supported by 12-months of external and internal facilitation as well as a clinical champion in each setting.  Effectiveness will be measured by extracting EHR data on a patient reported outcome, the Pain, Enjoyment & General Activity (PEG) score and opioid prescribing (evidence of tapering and/or opioid discontinuation).(Aim 2) An iterative mixed methods approach will be used to collect data on adoption, implementation and maintenance of the program through surveys, site-visit observations and interviews.(Aims 1 & 3) EHR data extracts and qualitative data will be collected at baseline, at the end of the initial intervention phase (which will be the start of the delayed intervention phase), and at the end of the delayed intervention phase. This final assessment will address sustainment among clinics in the initial intervention group.  In preparation for this study, the UG3 planning year Specific Aims are to: 1) Refine and test strategies to identify intent-to-treat patients with chronic pain, 2) Finalize the IBH and Six BB training materials, the UH3 study protocol and budgets and implementation timetable, and 3) Confirm adoption of the PEG scale into workflows across all clinics and conduct pilot tests of assessment tools to ensure data infrastructure and quality. A member of the qualitative research team will apply the PRECIS-2 assessment tool quarterly during the UG3 planning year and provide feedback to the team to ensure that the final trial is pragmatic. A team from each HCS including a primary care leader, a behavioral health care leader, a health IT support individual and a quality improvement lead will participate in monthly planning calls during the UG3 phase, and will host a one-day site visit by the principle investigators.

FP00024230,264,,,,,1,,,"Overview: Understanding co-proliferation of antibiotic resistance and biodegradation genes  PI Bruce Rittmann, Arizona State University (ASU). ASU co-PIs: Haiwei Gu, Kerry Hamilton, Yen-Jung Lai.    Emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a serious public health challenge worldwide.  Although AMR has been ascribed to widespread over-use of antibiotics, antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) can co-proliferate with genes for biodegrading certain xenobiotic organic chemicals that occur in wastewater and nature at much higher concentrations than the antibiotics.  Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the major driver for disseminating ARGs in these environments, and it is associated with the microorganisms physiological status and exposure to the other xenobiotics.    Among the relevant xenobiotics are the quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that are widely used as surfactants and disinfectants in clinical facilities, agriculture, industry, and households.  Although the QACs can be biodegraded in aerobic conditions, they change cells membranes, which disrupts oxidative phosphorylation and induces oxidative stress.  Microorganisms capable of biodegrading QACs have mechanisms to biodegrade the QACs and combat oxidative stress.  The genes for these protective functions reside on plasmids that also may contain ARGs.  When ARGs are present on plasmids along with the QAC-resistance genes, ARGs can be proliferated without any pressure from the antibiotics themselves.  Our over-arching question concerns the balance of benefit and risk from HGT of genes that allow bacteria to biodegrade QACs:  Is it possible to achieve high-efficiency biodegradation of QACs without proliferating ARGs via HGT?  We will evaluate the trade-offs by developing fundamental understanding in four aspects of HGT in the context of QAC biodegradation and ARG proliferation.  (1) Document and quantify the mechanisms underlying co-proliferation of ARGs and biodegradation genes in biofilms challenged with QACs.  (2) Develop a mathematical model that integrates the kinetics of QACs removal with the kinetics of HGT.  (3) Use quantitative health-risk modeling to evaluate the trade-offs between QAC biodegradation and ARG proliferation.  (4) Use both models to identify conditions leading to maximum QAC biodegradation, but minimized risk of ARGs.  Intellectual Merit: Antibiotic resistance is severe global threat to public health, but the insidious effects of non-antibiotics, such as QACs, on promoting the spread of ARG must be thoroughly understood, since the non-antibiotics often are present at much higher concentrations than for the antibiotics.  Our proposed research is an interdisciplinary study on the genomics, metabolomics, kinetics, and health risks associated with the proliferation of ARG due to the presence of QAC.  The findings will provide fundamental understanding of what controls HGT of ARG.  For example, is the presence of a QAC or the stress of low dissolved oxygen the larger promoter of HGT of ARG?  The research also will lead to guidance for how to operate biological treatment processes to minimize ARG proliferation.  In particular, can we find ways to maximize biodegradation of xenobiotics like QACs without proliferating ARG?   Broader Impacts:   The results will provide new tools to assess risks of the spread of antibiotic resistance and give guidance about the use and discharge of products that foster HGT of ARG, as well as for operation of wastewater treatment.  The proposed work also will provide a novel case study for sustainability research and education.  We will nurture microbiological and health-risk principles in K-12 science laboratories for school science teachers by involving high school teacher(s) and students from K-12 schools in AZ to participate the research activities via summer research internships.  We also will stimulate public interest by disseminating our scientific findings through social media supported by the Biodesign Institutes communication team and also in collaboration with the NSF sponsored website, Ask a biologist.  1  Project Summary ",
FP00024238,265,,,,,1,,,"Implications of Overturning the Affordable Care Act in Arizona: State Economy,  Health Care System and Children   Statement of Work  Background The Affordable Care Acts (ACA) future continues to be uncertain as Texas v. United States remains unresolved. This ongoing litigation challenges the ACAs minimum essential coverage provision and raises questions about the entire laws survival. The individual mandate provides that most people must maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage; those who do not do so must pay a financial penalty (known as the shared responsibility payment) to the IRS. The individual mandate was upheld as a constitutional exercise of Congress taxing power by a five member majority of the Supreme Court in NFIB v. Sebelius in 2012. The Trump Administration and 18 Republican state attorneys general are now asking the courts to strike down the entire ACA as unconstitutional, having filed their lawsuit in February 2018. Among the plaintiffs is Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and the crux of their argument is that the Supreme Courts decision in NFIB v. Sebelius upheld the ACAs individual coverage requirement under Congresss taxing power, and the 2017 tax law zeroed out that tax penalty. Without the tax in place, they claim, the coverage requirement is unconstitutional, making the rest of the ACA also unlawful  an argument that ignores Congresss choice to leave the ACA intact when it zeroed out the tax penalty.   The ACA remains in effect while the litigation is pending. However, if all or most of the law ultimately is struck down, it will have complex and far-reaching consequences for the nations health care system, affecting nearly all American, with certain vulnerable groups such as low-income children and working families shouldering the most dangerous implications. A host of popular ACA provisions could be eliminated, including protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, subsidies for individual health insurance, expanded eligibility for Medicaid, coverage of young adults up to age 26 under their parents insurance policies, coverage of preventive care with no patient cost-sharing, closing of the doughnut hole under Medicares drug benefit, and a series of tax increases to fund these initiatives. These provisions continue to be quite popular, even across party lines. A majority of the public  regardless of party identification  hold favorable views of many of the ACAs major provisions.   Nationally, the Urban Institute estimates that striking down the ACA would increase the number of uninsured people by 20 million, more than 14 million of which residing in Medicaid expansion states like Arizona. Overall, almost 75% of the increase in uninsured would include those with incomes below 200% of FPL. Coverage for nearly 400,000 people enrolled in Arizonas expanded Medicaid program--largely working families--would be at risk. Overturning the law without any stopgap protections in place could impact health care coverage of more than 700,000 Arizonans total, 130,000 children, take billions of dollars out of Arizona's economy, threaten safety net and rural hospitals, and leave Arizonas most vulnerable at risk.  Already, state lawmakers across the country have been preemptively proposing legislation to compensate for the loss of popular ACA protections. Senate Bill 1397 in Arizona, for instance, would prohibit health insurers from offering plans that exclude people with pre-existing conditions from coverage. However, the Bill is silent on whether people with pre-existing conditions could be charged higher premiums.   Scope of Work There are enormous opportunity costs associated with overturning the ACA. Should the law be dismantled, resources at both federal and state levels will be unleashed to reinstate provisions already in place today. Politics notwithstanding, there remains a more efficient and far less costly opportunity for legislators to instead build upon what has worked and revise what has not.   Through this analysis, we propose quantifying the consequences and opportunity costs associated with losing popular ACA provisions. Analyses will include state budget considerations necessary in order to compensate for the loss of these protections already offered at the federal level.  Faculty researchers at Arizona State Universitys College of Health Solutions will produce the following evidence-based, academic deliverables:  Preparation of Report regarding potential implications to 1.) local, state and private economies and 2.) the health care delivery system and 3.) children and working families in Arizona if the ACA is determined to be unconstitutional in whole or in parts. This deliverable will reflect our analysis of:  a.  Consequences of losing these key provisions, especially among vulnerable populations such as low-income children and working families;  b.  Bills already being proposed at the state level designed, all in or part, to provide stopgap protections in the event that the law is overturned; c.  Opportunity costs of reassembling parts of the law vs. building upon the foundation we already have, with oversight provided by an in-house ASU health economist.

FP00024274,266,,,,,1,,,"ABSTRACT  The cost of the opioid epidemic in the U.S. now exceeds $500 billion annually, with overdoses claiming 47,000 U.S. lives in 2018 alone. To counter this crisis, accurate and timely opioid monitoring methods are needed that show good coverage not just at national and state levels but also at local community levels. Opioid problems are concentrated  in  specific  communities,  and  community  opioid  data  are  critical  for  guiding  community  leaders, shaping local programmatic implementations, and steering policymaking. Unfortunately for communities, their progress  is  hampered  by  opioid  use  and  misuse  data  that  are  (i)  inaccurate  and  incomplete  or  unknown,  (ii) geospatially coarse, (iii) difficult to access given strict data accessibility rules, and (iv) delayed, with time lags of a year or more. These critical bottlenecks, that are common to many U.S. substance-use and community-health challenges in general, will be addressed in a first-of-its-kind research study by example of opioid misuse in the city of Tempe, AZ by (i) using an innovative, validated wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) method to quantify population-level opioid consumption in near real-time at the city and local community level monthly for 3 years; (ii) testing whether WBE data signficiantly improve prediction of opioid hospitalizations and deaths in the city, thereby enabling cities to better track the trajectory of the opioid crisis and evaluate intervention effectiveness; (iii)  working  with  city  stakeholders  from  multiple  sectors  to  optimize  the  worlds  first  real-time  interactive, community-codesigned opioid online dashboard that synthesizes community-specific WBE data on opioid and other substance use; and (iv) assessing how stakeholders are using WBE dashboard information to combat the opioid  crisis  in  their  community.  Extensive  preliminary  data  by  the  proposing  multi-disciplinary  team desmonstrate the feasibility and potential value of this first municipal-academic partnership of its kind, in which a U.S. city (Tempe, AZ) determines in wastewater the types and quantities of licit and illicit opioids and other drugs of abuse consumed at the community level. Over the course of five years, the team will optimize access and dissemination of this novel data source conveying information on citywide and local community substance use; determine whether WBE data improve prediction of the opioid crisis relative to conventional data sources alone  (i.e.,  prescription  opioid  volume);  and  ascertain  this  new  information  source  affects  community stakeholders responses to effectively fight the opioid crisis locally. The new tool will be easily scalable and, in addition to combating the opioid crisis, will address other substance-use and community-health challenges, such as community of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. A sustainability plan is in place to ensure continued access, use, and community benefiting from the new tools following award completion. ",

FP00024322,268,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Overview.  The  US  is  facing  an  unprecedented  modern  crisis  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The most recent government forecasts predict a national death toll that ultimately  may  reach  into  the  hundreds  of  thousands  or  even  higher,  if  the  coronavirus  cannot  be contained and managed effectively. Cities and communities across the United States (US) are struggling to  manage  the  crisis  because  they  lack  relevant  information  on  the  health  status  of  their  populations, information that is needed to inform on emergency response measures. Responding to this urgent  crisis, an  established  transdisciplinary  team    consisting  of  an  environmental  engineer,  a  virologist  and  a bioinformatician  at  Arizona  State  University  (ASU)    will  leverage  an  emergency  response  system, originally  established  as  a  microbial  biodiversity  observatory  and  tool  for  fighting  the  US  opioid epidemic, in order to  rapidly produce actionable data  on environmental quality,  urban stressors, and the health status of the City of Tempe, Arizona (population 185,000). Over the course of the 12-month project, starting April 2020, the project team will provide a new informational data stream to city decision makers and stakeholders, to inform on the environmental and human  condition  in  the  city  that  is  home  to  Americas  largest  university  campus.  Using  community wastewater  as  a  diagnostic  matrix,  the  team  will  analyze  the  concentrations  of  130+  wastewater-borne biomarkers  of  environmental  stress  and  human  wellbeing,  and  report  the  resultant  data  to  city stakeholders via an online dashboard for public health decision-making; a tool previously created by ASU and the City of Tempe, in an unprecedented academic-municipal partnership. Actionable  data  forthcoming  from  this  online  decision-making  tool  will  include  the  types  and quantities of air pollutants (determined as urinary biomarkers), medications taken as a result of fever and viral  infections  (e.g.,  ibuprofen),  allergy  suppressants,  stimulants  and  depressants  (such  as  nicotine  and alcohol), drugs of abuse (whose use may be modulated in response to stress, unemployment and limited mobility),  dietary  markers  (indicating  potential  food  shortages),  and  general  biomarkers  indicative  of human wellbeing and health status (e.g., glucocorticoid hormones, antidepressants). The project team and the city of Tempe will leverage their established data communication and decision-making  protocols,  including  immediate  posting  of  new  information  online,  monthly  standing meetings at Tempe City Hall with the Mayors team, to optimize health protection.   Intellectual Merit. This project will produce an unprecedented, rich stream of actionable information to inform  a  major  US  city  during  an  ongoing  severe  crisis.  It  will  leverage  archived  and  newly  collected wastewater  samples,  in  silico  chromatograms,  as  well  as  site-specific  know-how  and  scalable  data communication tools to advance emergency response in the city of Tempe. The study team will leverage baseline  data  collected  by  tandem  mass  spectrometry  over  the  past  two  years  to  determine  statistically significant changes in air pollution, medication use, environmental exposure and human health status as a result of COVID-19 and the drastic counter measures implemented by city, state and Federal governments (e.g., shelter-in-place ordinances, reduced urban mobility, furlough and forced unemployment).  Broader Impacts. The data from this project will help to inform public health management practices to address  the  current  SARS-CoV-2  /  COVID-19  outbreak  at  a  local  level  and  longer-term  throughout communities  across  the  US  and  abroad.  The  data  will  be  extremely  useful  for  city/town  planners  and urban ecologists, mayors of towns and cities, local health boards and agencies, healthcare providers, and policy  makers  including  members  of  Congress.  Ultimately,  the  project  will  protect  the  health  of  the general public and reduce morbidity and mortality. We also envisage that this information will assist the regions  and  states  to  work  appropriately  with  social  workers  to  address  some  of  the  mental  and  social challenges that the community will face as a consequence of this disaster. While most of the country is under lockdown, the city of Tempe and Arizona State University will safely continue to operate to collect and record for current and future generations, the profile of a large panel of biomarkers on environmental stress,  behavioral  responses,  and  human  health  during  this  unprecedented  national  crisis  that coincidentally is occurring during the year of the 24th US census.

FP00024343,269,,,,,1,,,"Background and Significance: There is a staggering disparity of suicide among American Indians in this nation.  The American Indian suicide rate is over 3.5 times higher than other racial/ethnic groups and rates have been increasing since 2003. This study has potential to improve the quality of evidence regarding outcomes that matter to American Indians and reduce disparities by showing the effectiveness of a culturally-driven suicide crisis line compared with usual practice. Effective suicide prevention interventions with American Indian patients require special considerations such as extended time, patience, flexibility, persistence, and trust to increase crisis line utilization and develop services. Importantly, there is no such thing as Native Culture, and the thousands of unique Tribal communities require their own Tribal-driven approaches to support their traditions with respect and consideration. Tribes often have taboos around talking about death, especially death by suicide, and interventions by suicide crisis call specialists must recognize these cultural imperatives to respectfully respond to the caller. There is a substantial evidence gap in establishing the most effective way to provide suicide crisis line services and treatment for American Indian populations who reside in significantly underserved areas. This proposed study will contribute to the comparative effectiveness evidence base regarding tailored, customized patient-centered approaches for American Indian populations. Equally important, there is tremendous potential for the findings to be adopted into clinical practice and improve delivery of care. The intervention for this project helps address pressing access barriers and is based on a culturally-relevant crisis response service while the outcomes matter to patients, their families, and communities in important ways. Next, the intervention can be easily adopted nationally as part of an existing crisis line service that is currently used by many American Indian communities. Finally, the stakeholders in this study are poised to support rapid implementation into clinical practice to improve care delivery. These stakeholders include the state Medicaid program, payers, stakeholders, and the leading national American Indian advocacy organization, the National Indian Health Board (NIHB). NIHB has extensive experience implementing best practices across Indian country and is the foremost national organization to inform sovereign Tribal governments for policies, strategies, and approaches to improve the health of American Indians.Study Aims: The goal of this project is to reduce disparities in deaths by suicide among the Navajo Nation and to study the effectiveness of a wraparound culturally-relevant suicide crisis call center program for the Navajo population compared to current Western practices. The intervention will address fundamental access barriers faced by the Navajo community and is based on our program currently operating in the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community in the Phoenix, Arizona area. The Navajo-driven patient-centered project is specifically designed with and implemented by partners. The intervention consists of a crisis call line which embraces Navajo cultural values, traditions and language. To maximize patient-centered effectiveness, the crisis call line will be staffed by Navajo crisis call specialists and supplemented by culturally-relevant outreach efforts while ensuring referral to treatment for all crisis call line contacts.Study Description: This study is a complex intervention with three intervention functions: 1) a culturally-relevant outreach and prevention strategy that is American Indian developed and implemented at the Tribal unit level, 2) a culturally-relevant crisis line intervention, and 3) a comprehensive system of warm handoffs. This project will involve four partners working closely together: Arizona State University, the Navajo Nation, the National Indian Health Board, and Crisis Response Network. As indicated repeatedly in discussions with our Advisory Council and patient representatives, current practice is composed of inconsistent education and outreach efforts which are often not culturally relevant, crisis lines based on Western culture which have not been developed for American Indians, and fragmented follow-up services with substantial barriers to access due to distance and provider shortages. We use a cluster randomized trial with a hybrid effectiveness-implementation (HEI Type 2) design to equally evaluate both effectiveness and implementation outcomes.",

Women will be screened for HTN following ACSM guidelines.13 We will give participants Fitbit HR monitors to capture resting heart rate (RHR) to measure fitness, and heart rate variability (HRV) devices to assess ANS balance. We will explore how the interventions may act through different mediating pathways in improving BP, how these novel PAs are maintained, and short-term sustained change on BP.

We expect that participants in both the MVPA and LPA conditions will show significantly greater reductions in BP (primary outcome) both immediately post-intervention (T2) and longer term (T3) compared to the EC. We will also compare the effects of MVPA and LPA interventions vs. EC on self-reported stress (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale), increased fitness (FitBit assessment of RHR), and improvements in ANS balance (resting HRV)(secondary outcomes) at T2 and T3 to those in the EC. Last, we will explore mediation of heart rate and HRV during-participation in intervention activities on BP, to examine potential differences in intervention-specific pathways. Our prior work provides promise for MVPA and LPA to (a) achieve BP changes using novel, online interventions (b) learn more about mechanisms of BP reduction that may differ between intervention types, and (c) improve PA levels beyond the intervention period. Results of this study will provide model-based understanding of pathways of hypertension reduction in the short term that, if successful, will be used to inform future study of culturally-acceptable interventions in longer term and effectiveness research.

FP00024414,272,,,,,1,,,"Gallbladder cancer (GbCa), the most frequent malignancy of the biliary tract, is a non-sex organ malignancy with doubled incidence rate in women comparing to men and highly fatal due to its insidiously late stage when diagnosed. This proposal has two independent Aims: Aim-1 to identify modifiable risk factors contributing to the persistent sex disparity of GbCa incidence, and Aim-2 to characterize metabolomic-wide and genome-wide a prominent risk factor for GbCa, namely, gallstone disease (also named cholelithiasis).  Several important risk factors have been identified for developing GbCa beyond older age and being female, including and not limited to harboring gallstones, obesity or overweight, type II diabetes, tobacco smoking, and genetic predisposition.  While many of these risk factors are modifiable or predictable, no significant progress has been reported to date in understanding the mechanisms of and reducing the sex disparity in GbCa incidence. In our proposed study, Aim-1 will assess the sex difference in top three modifiable risk factors for GbCa in Maricopa County of Arizona, utilizing existing comprehensive data from the County Department of Public Health and Arizona Hospitals Discharge and Claim records at Center for Health Information & Research (CHiR). Our objective is to provide evidence for sex-specific prioritized strategy in early detection and intervention of modifiable risk factors in reducing GbCa incidence.  Gallstones, where stones are formed in the gallbladder, liver or bile duct, occur in up to 80% of GbCa patients, particularly in people with Latino, Hispanic and American Indian origin. Gallstone disease (GSD) or cholelithiasis is a common medical condition in U.S. adults, with many shared risk factors, e.g., metabolic syndrome and health-related behaviors, but wider sex disparity, 2 to 3 fold, than observed in GbCa. Besides the morbidity and mortality associated with cholelithiasis itself, the excessive risk of digestive system cancers in gallstone carriers is remarkable. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and determinants leading to gallstones, symptomatic and asymptomatic, could directly impact not only GSD but also multiple cancers of the digestive system.  In Aim-2, we will focus on GSD by assessing plasma metabolomes and existing data of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for 624 individuals to identify and validate metabolic markers in predicting gallstone phenotypes, and their associations with sex difference in GSD and GbCa risk. We hypothesize that the known sex difference in GSD can be revealed by differing metabolite signals integrated with high-risk genotypes, which in turn may serve as biomarkers associated with risk of GbCa and other GI system cancers. The overarching goal of the two interrelated aims is to lay a foundation for developing effective strategies in early diagnosis and timely treatment of GSD in high-risk populations. Our ultimate objective is to identify the actionable targets in reducing GSD and, thereby, GbCa burden among high-risk individuals.",

FP00024490,274,,,,,1,,,"Food insecurity (FI), or the lack of consistent access to affordable food, is a major public health problem that persists in the US. FI is associated with poor dietary quality, compromised physical and mental health, and poor academic performance. FI has been exasperated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with preliminary national estimates indicating over 20% of households experienced FI in the early weeks of the pandemic, with higher rates among households who lost work or income, including college students. FI among college students has gained considerable attention in the past 5-10 years, given findings from numerous studies suggest that the prevalence of FI in college students is 3-4 times the national prevalence (~39% vs. ~11% in 2018, respectively). However, our published qualitative and quantitative data indicate that college students likely respond to FI measurement modules differently than the general population. In particular, college students may have a difficult time conceptualizing the term money in the items because students have a unique portfolio of monetary (e.g., income from employment, money from parents/family, scholarships/loans) and non-monetary (e.g., meal plans, free food events) food resources to consider when answering FI questions. Ultimately, interpretational inconsistencies may result in misclassification of FI, inaccurate prevalence estimates, and unknown impacts on health outcomes. To our knowledge, there is no reliable and validated measure of FI for college studentsand few studies have used rigorous methods to assess associations of health outcomes with FI. Thus, the overall purpose of this study is to develop and test a new measure of FI that is reliable and valid for the college student population, through a mixed-methods study. Through our first primary aim, we will use qualitative methods to develop a novel measure through conducting iterative interviews with key subgroups of college students (n=120), and content experts in FI and college student health (n=20). Once we have a draft new measure from these conversations, in our second primary aim, we will conduct psychometrics of the new college FI measure among a random, representative sample of 1500 full-time college students, allowing for further refinement of the new measure. Finally, we will continue to test the validity of the measure by comparing associations of health outcomes (diet, physical activity, sleep, and mental health outcomes) with the new college FI measure and the standard household FI measure with a new random sample of students (n=1500). Objective measures of diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress will be used in order to improve the precision of the estimates of the effects of FI on vulnerable college students.

FP00024491,276,,,,,1,,,"Abstract   Metabolic dysregulation is a risk factor for the development, recurrence and progression of breast cancer. Metabolic factors may be especially important in individuals treated with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), drugs that induce hyperglycemia through disruption of insulin signaling. Data from pre-clinical studies show that the compensatory hyperinsulinemia induced by PI3K inhibitors leads to partial restoration of PI3K signaling and promotes cellular proliferation. Energy balance interventions, particularly exercise and intermittent fasting, are well-tolerated and favorably impact insulin, glucose, and other metabolic biomarkers in women with early-stage breast cancer. Data regarding the impact of diet and exercise interventions on metabolic factors in breast cancer patients with advanced disease are lacking.  We propose a three-arm trial to evaluate the impact of either 1) prolonged nightly fasting alone, 2) prolonged nightly fasting with moderate intensity exercise versus 3) an attention control on metabolic markers in 180 women with advanced hormone receptor (HR)+ breast cancer initiating treatment with endocrine therapy in combination with a PI3K inhibitor. The study would represent one the first trials evaluating the feasibility of implementing a multi-faceted lifestyle intervention in individuals with advanced breast cancer. Participants would undergo collection of fasting blood and assessment of physical activity, diet, physical function and patient reported outcomes at baseline (prior to the initiation of PI3K inhibitor, and at each 3 month follow-up appointment until the drug is no longer tolerated (median time on drug in 8.3 months) or until 12 months. The primary outcome will be fasting blood glucose at 3 months with hemoglobin A1C and insulin as secondary outcomes.  The overarching goal of this project is to determine whether intermittent fasting with or without moderate intensity exercise can mitigate the adverse metabolic sequalae, and improve  treatment outcomes, in women with advanced breast cancer treated with PI3K inhibitors.    ASU Statement of Work: The sponsoring sites 5-year study will examine the blood of 180 breast cancer patients collected before, during, and  after  participation  in  3-arm  randomized  controlled  trial,  testing  a  year-long  protocol  of  prolonged  nightly fasting,  with  and  without  exercise,  to  affect  metabolic,  inflammation,  lifestyle  modifications,  survivorship outcomes, and PI3K-inhibitor adverse treatment effects in advanced-stage breast cancer patients. The blood biomarkers to be measured at ASU are insulin, c-peptide, and c-reactive protein (CRP). The central hypothesize of this application is that prolonged nightly fasting, with and without exercise, will reduce negative metabolic outcomes, improve survivorship outcomes, and enable longer on-drug treatment.   Dorothy Sears, PhD, Subcontract PI, Co-Investigator, Professor of Nutrition in the College of Health Solutions, will provide expertise on prolonged nightly fasting and related molecular assays on biospecimens. Dr. Sears has extensive experience in human and mouse models of intermittent fasting, circadian alignment of food intake, insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity-related cancer. She is an expert in biomarkers of insulin resistance and breast cancer risk. This and Dr. Sears expertise on biomarkers and health benefits of circadian alignment of food intake and nightly fasting in humans inform the current study.

FP00024542,278,,,,,1,,,"Over two million Americans have clinically diagnosed language impairments (aphasia) due to stroke. The ability to communicate is the top predictor of quality of life after a stroke, so it is critical to have effective treatment approaches to aphasia. While speech comprehension impairments are the top predictor of overall communication difficulties after a stroke, current speech comprehension treatment approaches generally suffer from low effect sizes and poor generalizability. One major roadblock to effective aphasia treatments has been that most prominent models of aphasia lack consideration of cognitive impairments that may be affecting communication abilities. The purpose of this proposal is to identify how cognitive impairments contribute to speech comprehension impairments in stroke survivors with aphasia. Selective attention is a particularly promising cognitive mechanism of speech comprehension impairments to investigate because it is foundational to other cognitive abilities known to be critical for speech comprehension, and previous work with other neurogenic populations indicates that selective attention-focused treatments can generalize to and improve performance on a variety of complex cognitive tasks. Yet, selective attention is largely understudied and untapped by current approaches to aphasia. The current project will comprehensively examine the contributions of selective attention to speech comprehension abilities in stroke survivors. Stroke survivors with aphasia and matched neurotypical control participants will complete a series of behavioral measures of selective attention and speech comprehension in addition to resting-state functional MRI and structural MRI protocols.

FP00024614,281,,,,,1,,,"OverviewIn this Developing and Testing Innovations ITEST project, we propose to broaden the participation in STEM/ICT of students of refugee backgrounds (SRBs), in grades 7-12, living in the Phoenix area. Our partnership includes five ethnic community-based organizations (Burundian, Congolese, Iraqi, Somali, Syrian), six colleges and schools at Arizona State University, and three community colleges (Phoenix, Gateway, Glendale). Guided by Possible Selves and Social Cognitive Career theories, along with researchregarding the influence of family, we are mustering and adapting existing resources and creating dynamictechnology experiences to affect SRBs self-efficacy, STEM/ICT identity, interests, and aspirations to pursue STEM/ICT learning and careers. Additionally, we will impact familial college social capital and STEM/ICT capital. We will engage SRBs and parents in the following:* Families participate in an adapted award-winning 8-session college-knowledge program focused on enabling parents to be effective higher education advocates for their childrens education. We are coupling these sessions with newly designed family engagement activities focused on STEM/ICT career pathways.* SRBs participate in long-term structured e-mentoring on smartphones with STEM/ICT professionals and STEM/ICT college students who share similar backgrounds.* Family field trips to multiple college campuses to interact with faculty and students, visit STEM/ICT resources, and learn about college life and various STEM/ICT pathways.* SRBs create digital stories at media labs that reflect their STEM/ICT aspirations and the stories of people from their communities who inspire them.This project, Promoting Aspirations in STEM/ICT through Social Capital, Art, Relationships, and Doing (PASSCARD) provides a transformative way of marshaling resources to provide STEM/ICT learning experiences that bolster representation of refugee families.Intellectual MeritWe will advance knowledge about STEM/ICT workforce development by addressing our research questions framed around three research branches: (1) understanding project effects on Possible Selves andSocial Cognitive Career Theory variables, (2) identifying interactions of culture and gender with STEM/ICT, and (3) examining alignment of personal narratives and cultural master narratives regarding what it means to become, and how to become, a STEM/ICT professional in the U.S.  We will determine composite and specific effects of the projects activities on self-efficacy, STEM/ICT identity, outcome expectations, and STEM/ICT interests, in support of STEM/ICT goals. We also advance knowledge by developing comprehension of how understudied refugee communities access cultural epistemologies and family resources, as well as utilize new college knowledge, e-mentors, and digital storytelling, as they navigate STEM/ICT pathways.  Finally, our holistic approach advances knowledge about particular effects of our innovative uses of technology (e-mentoring and digital storytelling) as well as how these technology experiences align with other elements to support SRBs STEM/ICT aspirations.Broader ImpactsOur project has broader impact through inclusion, research, and partnership innovation. Via inclusion  refugees have been overlooked, if not disregarded, by traditional educational supports. Beyond our 5 partner refugee communities, we will impact refugee outreach through our dissemination plan which includes communication with the International Rescue Committee and other U.S. refugee communities. Via research  by advancing knowledge of how STEM/ICT career aspirations are influenced by technology experiences and by families learning together, this project impacts societal goals of promotingSTEM/ICT and developing a STEM/ICT-ready workforce because it helps us understand influences on career decisions, particularly among minoritized people. This is especially meaningful for STEM/ICT matriculation and higher education recruitment efforts. Via partnership innovation  this project establishes a partnership among 5 refugee communities and 4 institutions of higher education. We believethis is the first time this type of model has been established, particularly one focused on STEM/ICT. Other communities possess similar ingredients and we can serve as a model to be replicated. We will proactively demonstrate our model to ECBO leaders and college faculty/staff interested in developing similar partnerships by reaching out through our dissemination plan and professional networks.

FP00024623,282,,,,,1,,,"RAPID: FACT: Federated Analytics based Contact Tracing for COVID-191. Urgency of Proposed ResearchThe spread of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly-infectious disease caused by a newlydiscovered coronavirus, has reached pandemic levels across the globe. As of April 28, 2020, over 3.1Mpeople worldwide have been infected with almost 220k reported deaths and 1M cases and over 60k fatalitiesin the USA. As the numbers in the USA of infections, critical care interventions and deaths continue torise, mobile applications (apps) that enable contact tracing (CT) are being rapidly deployed to monitor thespread of COVID-19. These apps monitor the spread of the disease, from those determined positive, usingrandom (anonymized) event tokens that are stored locally on user phones and exchanged during encountersbetween infected persons and others. This allows users to securely search a continually updated centralrepository (server) of tokens for diagnosed cases to assess their own infection status. However, it is fastbecoming clear that on-going deployments, based on token sharing without exploiting the rich local devicedata, are insufcient in monitoring disease spread in a timely manner and are also vulnerable to privacy andsecurity attacks. There is an urgent need to develop CT apps that not only monitor but also intervene tolimit COVID-19 spread without violating user security and privacy. We address this challenge by proposingthe platform of Federated Analytics based Contact Tracing (FACT). FACT renes the paradigm of federatedlearning to leverage both device-level data and server capabilities in a private and secure manner to enableCT for prevention and intervention by including hotspot identication, user alerts, and continual assessmentof user COVID-19 risk. This approach guarantees a private, secure, and veriable way to (i) evaluate ausers need for testing or their resilience to exposure, and (ii) assess herd immunity across the population.Intellectual Merit: The proposed work leverages the teams combined and rich expertise in privacy,security, distributed and federated learning, acoustic signal processing and health analytics to address fourdistinct yet interrelated thrusts, detailed below, that can enable secure and private COVID-19 contact tracing.Thrust 1: Secure, Resilient and Scalable Contact Tracing: Current Bluetooth-based systems are vulner-able to a variety of attacks and restrict server learning signicantly. We will develop more secure system viaGPS+Bluetooth with the goal of enabling the server to detect geographical infection clusters in a privacy-preserving manner leveraging our expertise on cryptography, and multiparty secure computation (MPC).Thrust 2: Assessing User Risk in a Federated Manner: Leveraging our strengths in learning deep modelsfor large datasets and acoustic signals, we propose to access risk for an individual exposed to COVID-19 bylearning, via FL, models on device in two ways: (i) using user mobility trace and server hotspot patterns,and (ii) further rening risks by including specic phonation signals from users microphone.Thrust 3: Scalable and Private FL for FACT: To support the above FL tasks in providing accurate andreal-time risk assessments to large numbers of users, we propose: (i) new model compression and knowledgetransfer techniques for training user-specic models optimized for resource-constrained devices, and (ii) anovel federated distillation method for aggregating diverse models with accuracy, speed and privacy.Thrust 4: Development, Deployment, and Evaluation: With the support of ASU University TechnologyOfce, we will deploy and evaluate the proposed research via the ASU Mobile App, an Android/iOS appused daily by tens of thousands of users. We will bootstrap the development using the existing user mobilitydata collected by the app, roll out the proposed contact tracing as new features to the app, and leverage theexisting user base for large-scale testing and evaluation.Broader Impacts: The proposed work can positively impact efforts in stopping the spread of COVID-19and also support recovery by providing rapid, accurate, and scalable contact tracing. Via collaboration withASU UTO and discussions with Google and Aural Analytics Inc., our solutions can be tested vigorouslybefore broader adoption. The acoustic parameters proposed here have already been adopted as endpointsin clinical trials by pharmaceutical companies. Our work can extend the clinical utility of these measuresfor use in COVID-19 patients.

This REU supplement focuses on the on-device risk assessment and seeks to further understand how federated learning can enhance assessment of risks based on daily surveys and phonation methods. Learning algorithms that use device data locally can continually alert users of their risk levels thereby acting as immediate interventions in limiting spread.  Thanks to the RAPID grant, PI Sankar received a grant from Google AI for Social Good and the combination of the two awards made them eligible to receive reams of daily health survey data from Facebook via the CMU Delphi project that administers and manages the survey. Our work through this grant has helped us develop learning models that are robust to feature and label noise and also enhance an existing well-studied boosting algorithm called XGBoost to create a new algorithm called XGBoost.alpha which allows us to tune a hyperparameter alpha away from 1 (which  is  the  standard  logistic  loss  used  in  XGBoost)  to  achieve  robustness  to  noise  and/or imbalances. Our preliminary results are extremely encouraging but more work needs to be done to understand  how  such  models  can  be  enhanced  using  deep  learning  and  also  using  federated learning.  Starting summer 2021, PI Sankar will be working with several summer interns (working remotely via  an  ASU-supported  Summer  Undergraduate  Research  Initiative)  who  are  undergraduate students  at  ASU  majoring  in  both  Computer  Science  and  Mathematics.  These  students  are extremely interested in the theory of deep learning and will begin working in Sankars lab in summer 2021 with support from an ASU Summer Undergraduate Research Initiative program created within the Deans office to encourage exposure to research for a more diverse student body. An REU Supplement to the RAPID grant can help PI Sankar continue to work with these students through  fall.  The  prospective  undergraduate  researcher  supported  by  this  REU  will  study, implement,  and  modify  the  q-Fair  Federated  Learning  (q-FFL)  algorithm  by  Li,  et  al.,  which provides  fairness  and  uniformity  guarantees  in  statistically  heterogeneous  domains,  most specifically federated learning. Specifically, the prospective undergraduate researcher will: (1) learn about the novel loss function of Sypherd et al. called alpha-loss and compare this work to q-FFL in order to determine the applicability of alpha-loss to federated learning domains. This will enable an extension of the viable domains presented by Sypherd, et al.  (2) The  undergraduate  researcher  will  learn  about  noise  models  in  federated  learning  and compare alpha-loss with the work presented by Yang, et al. in Robust Federated Learning with  Noisy  Labels.  This  will  be  of  particular  interest  because  of  previous  results  by Sypherd, et al. indicate a level of natural robustness to noise in the deep learning setting which may carry over to federated learning. Specifically label noise will be examined by the undergraduate researcher and the accuracy of a global network, trained in a federated manner, will be measured.  (3) If  time  and  resources  permit,  the  implementation  of  alpha-loss  as  a  federated  learning objective will be tested on SARS-CoV-2 related survey data that the PI has access to and which is naturally noisy due to erroneous surveys. This dataset will be split amongst a number of subsets which will act as different federated learners. These results will then be compared with results using the method indicated in Yang, et al.    Through  completion  of  their  summer  research,  the prospective undergraduate  researcher  will enhance  their  Python  and  Pytorch  skills, learn  about  advanced  statistics  and  machine  learning concepts, and gain valuable project experience to add to their portfolio, which will be of benefit to them, whether they decide to go into academia or industry. Finally, the student will work closely with undergraduate, master's, and PhD students along with Professor Sankar and several of her academic  colleagues.  Thus,  the prospective undergraduate  researcher  will  gain  first-hand experience of academic research and continue to build their own network.  Such an REU supplement for 2020-2021 from the NSF CIF program helped PI Sankar work with and mentor Nathan Stromberg, a UG from the University of Kentucky. Nathan will be joining ASUs PhD program in ECEE as Sankars advisee. Nathan was also awarded a Deans Fellowship by the Fulton Schools of Engineering for his outstanding academic record. The REU program has been extremely helpful to PI Sankar to mentor and work with undergraduates and she hopes to do so again to study federated learning in more detail and continue working with COVID-19 related datasets.

The likelihood of a subsequent pregnancy within 12 months of a stillbirth ranges between 50-98%, highlighting the crucial need for interconception care, the time between the babys death and the subsequently born child, for promoting psychological health. Our systematic review of interventions providing interconception care for women after stillbirth identified only two interventions in the last 36 years, with no evidence of efficacy for mitigating psychological health problems. In response to the overwhelming lack of research examining interventions for bereaved mothers during the  interconception  period,  we  developed  and  tested  the  feasibility  of  a  12-week,  home-based,  online  yoga intervention  among  mothers  that  had  experienced  a  stillborn  baby  (R34AT008808).  We  identified  the achievement  of  satisfaction  and  enjoyment  benchmarks  and  improvements  in  PTSD  symptoms.  However, women did not meet fidelity benchmarks for yoga participation (min/wk). Mothers suggested that different types of social support should be integrated into future interventions to promote engagement and fidelity in the online yoga intervention. The findings from our feasibility study underscore the importance of and need for an in-home online yoga intervention in conjunction with social support to improve yoga participation. However, it is unknown what combination and types of support will best facilitate yoga participation and most improve PTSD symptoms among bereaved women after stillbirth.   We  propose  a  multiphase  optimization  strategy  (MOST)  framework  to  identify  the  most  potent intervention for increasing yoga participation and later reducing symptoms of PTSD among bereaved mothers after stillbirth. First, in Phase 1, Preparation, we will conduct a 30-day feasibility study in 45 stillbirth mothers (n=15/component)  with  PTSD.  We  will  pilot-test  procedures  and  establish  feasibility  for  intervention  support components (i.e., online yoga instructor support, social media-based peer support, and online grief counselor support) in preparation for a fully powered optimization trial. Second, in Phase 2, Optimization, we will conduct a fully powered 23 factorial experimental design that will allow us to evaluate the impact of each intervention support component on yoga participation (min/wk). We will enroll 304 mothers within three years after stillbirth and randomly assign them to one of eight experimental conditions (n=38/condition) that includes a combination of the three support components. All women will be asked to participate in at least 60 min/wk of online yoga over the 12-wk intervention. Results from Phase 2 will  provide the much needed, rigorous evidence for the social support components to be included in a future optimized online yoga RCT.   ",
FP00024626,285,,,,,1,,,"Background and significance: This project focuses on adaptations to health care delivery and the impact of adaptations on vulnerable populations. We focus on practice surveillance and care delivery to patients who are COVID-19 affected, at risk, recovering, and non COVID-19 virus affected but high risk because of health and/or behavioral conditions, as well as impact of social disparities of health. Because of the necessary focus on disease impact, organized ways of responding to these other high risk groups are limited, and need effective identification, assessment, intervention and monitoring to assure best care delivery.  Any response needs to be implemented in a way that does not add to the burden of care delivery. In the last years prior to COVID-19, there has been rapid developments in patient reported measurement of their functioning and information technology to capture and use that information in care decisions. Combining these can transform how care is assessed and monitored. We will evaluate such a system in 3 Arizona health care delivery systems, and this effort will create structures and processes that can be rapidly and widely implemented. The studys objective is to improve care for multiple at risk patients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use emerging measurement and informatics technology to identify, assess, deliver, monitor and evaluate care to at risk populations, with racial and ethnic disparities, from primarily underserved communities. Study Aims include:  Implementation of an automated, population based initial EHR vulnerability index using an algorithm validated on populations including racial and ethnic minorities from underserved populations. For those patients identified as high risk, clinic staff will reach out to collect standardized HRQoL and SDoH measures to identify patient sub-pools according to measured risk. Evaluate the effects of the system using the RE-AIM framework1.   A mixed methods methodology using key informant interviews, congruent with this research design will be used to assess facilitators and barriers to implementation. To collaborate with partners and stakeholders to create a learning health system to include partners, patients, key Arizona stakeholders. We will partner with three community primary care health delivery systems to implement the system (Wesley Community & Health Center, Copa Health, and Equality Health).  Wesley Community & Health Center and Equality Health have ongoing project partnerships with team members. Each of these organizations primarily serve at risk racial and ethnic minority patient populations, and focus on providing services to disadvantaged populations, with limited resources. Successful implementation of this system is expected to improve the efficiency of care to vulnerable patients, provide reassurance to patients and providers through actionable steps, and mitigate provider burden through the use of health informatics. This will address an increasingly emergent implementation gap in care generating implementation strategies acceptable to both patients and providers.  Our work with these organizations focused on early aspects of the proposed content, predates COVID-19 activities. Continued work has led us to conversations about how their needs have changed pursuant to COVID-19 and confirm that the proposed effort and services this system provides are important and necessary. Outcomes of this project will include improved reach and access to care of vulnerable populations to include patients with COVID-19 virus and other subpopulations at high risk, design and implementation of workflows tailored to the risk sub populations, clinical systems to identify, monitor and effectively care for high risk populations, and generalizable findings form multiple partners. Because of our history and relationships with partners, we are able to start up at grant award and collect data by Month 4 and follow and report on the effectiveness of the implementation for 16 months.",
FP00024680,286,,,,,1,,,"Regulatory elements (REs) in noncoding regions of the human genome are integral to transcriptional controls. Genetic variants disrupting normal RE functions lead to dysregulated gene transcription and contribute to human diseases. However, despite the availability of a large volume of multi-omics data, discovering functional REs remains a daunting task. Scanning for motifs of transcription factor binding sites or specific histone modification marks has low specificities. Traditional conservation-based multi-species analysis has very limited power in noncoding regions. Consequently, there remain tremendous knowledge gaps in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms, disease-causing noncoding variants, and evolution of regulatory networks. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a comparative approach that integrates multi-omics data across phylogeny to accurately identify functional REs. Based on strong premises of RE epistasis, our innovative methods distinguish between cooperative REs (COREs) that function collaboratively and orphan REs that function individually. Our methods also quantify transcriptional contribution of REs. The central hypothesis is that COREs are the primary control units of gene transcription and regulatory evolution. To test this hypothesis, we will develop a DeepCORE method to discover, validate, and analyze COREs in 200kbps gene-flanking regions. DeepCORE is a deep-learning-based algorithm that models RE interactions at various levels of genome organization and predicts REs with significant transcriptional impact. We will apply DeepCORE to >100 multi-omics data sets from primates and mammals to identify tissue-specific and lineage-specific COREs. Comparison across species will reveal evolutionary origins, TFBS turnover rates, and sequence and epigenetic conservation of COREs. We will also investigate distributions of COREs in disease pathways and usefulness of CORE architecture in fine-mapping causal variants. For a set of high-confidence novel COREs, we will experimentally validate their functions and cooperativities. Finally, to make methodological advances into tools useful in biological research, we will implement DeepCORE as cross-platform tools, release genome-wide maps of COREs in an online database and organize a user community on Github. All executables and annotations will be open-source and available free of charge for research, education, and training. Overall, our proposed research will answer a challenging yet unresolved question of how and to what extent REs cooperate to affect evolution and human health. Our discoveries will significantly impact clinical and basic research as an in",
FP00024685,287,,,,,1,,,"Purpose: To reduce the potential for exertional heat illness and assess the effect of sauna on reducing carcinogen risk by measuring physiological and psychological indicators influencing firefighter health and performance. Aims: (1) Assess self-reported capacity and perceptions concerning heat readiness; (2) Examine the safety and effect on carcinogen clearance of post-fire exposure sauna visits; (3A) To determine the effect of short-term heat acclimation, combining exercise and sauna visits, to the stimulation of summer heat readiness, and (3B) the natural heat acclimatization of structural and wildland firefighters from presummer to post-summer. Relevance: Firefighters encounter heat stress due to fire exposure, protectiveclothing, and exertion, yet this stress is magnified in summer due to extreme environmental temperatures. Optimal adaptation to heat stress may reduce illness and injury, and improve mood states, cognitive, and physical performance. Methods: Observational cohort study using a questionnaire (Aim 1); randomizedclinical trial (Aim 2) testing physical and psychological recovery after fire exposure, as well as dermal and urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clearance; clinical trial (Aim 3A) assessing heat acclimation; and quasi-experiment (Aim 3B) assessing heat acclimation and acclimatization. All experimental aims use firefighter specific tasks or work capacity in combination with physiological outcomes of core and skin temperature, heart rate, hydration status, and psychological outcomes of moodstate and decision making. Anticipated outcomes: The combined effect of this research with associated future interventional trials based on the study outcomes should markedly improve heat readiness and reduce heat-related illnesses and injuries in the fire service.",
FP00024691,288,,,,,1,,,"While there remains a significant and growing shortage of transplantable organs, nearly 20% of deceased kidney donations are discarded each year in the United States.1 Due to this shortage, patients are removed from the wait list because their health has deteriorated so much that they are no longer qualified to receive a transplant or they die while on the wait list. Patients dying and being taken off the wait list while recovered organs are being discarded highlights the need to improve the allocation and acceptance of viable kidney donations in the United States.An underlying barrier to improving the allocation and acceptance of deceased kidneys is a lack of a fundamental understanding as to why the refusal rate for similar kidneys is so high for some transplant centers, but not others.2 Our research teams expertise in behavioral economics, survey/experimental design, and kidney transplantationmakes us well suited to develop new methods to refine past models of clinicians decision-making and explain the heterogeneity in acceptance rates. The central hypothesis to our proposed work is that the unexplained heterogeneity in acceptance rates is caused by idiosyncratic preferences and behavioral biases in clinicians decision-making. These preferences and behavioral biases may result in fewer lifesaving transplants, longer wait lists, and ultimately, a decrease in the life expectancy of patients in need of a kidney transplant. Although many preferences and biases have been hypothesized to affect clinicians decisions, researchers lack avalidated instrument to measure them. We will pilot and validate a platform (SimUNetSM) that will allow us to estimate the influence of a wide range preferences and behavioral biases on acceptance rates. Our pilot of the SimUNetSM platform will elicit clinicians risk preferences for accepting deceased-donor kidneys. To validate our platform, we will test for correlations between individuals risk preferences elicited in SimUNetSM to behavior in practice. While acceptance rates vary by many factors, risk preferences serve as a natural candidate for validation given the prominent role they have been shown to play in clinicians decision-making.35Aim 1: Design an instrument to elicit preferences for risk using the SimUNetSM interface. SimUNetSM is a web-based interface developed by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and Co-I Darren Stewart that simulates DonorNet R, the interface surgeons & nephrologist use when making a decision to accept a deceased-donor kidney for transplantation.68 In our first aim, 130 clinicians will be asked to complete 15 standardized patient vignettes in the SimUNetSM platform. The vignettes will systematically vary the risk of accepting a deceased kidney donation relative to dialysis, which will allow us to estimate risk preferences. Aim 2: Create clinician level data set of deceased kidney turn down rates. Currently, there is no data set that contains individual clinicians decision to accept a deceased donor-kidney. In our second aim, we will collaborate with transplants centers across the US to identify clinician-specific decisions to accept a deceased donor kidneys. We have early letters of support from 8 transplant centers who have committed to provide us with the data necessary to identify individual level decision-making in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) data and also, map this data with the observed behavior in Aim 1 (See Section 5.b for more detail). Aim 3: Validate the use of SimUNetSM by testing for correlations between risk preferences observed in SimUNetSM interface and OPTN data. To evaluate whether the decision to accept a deceased-donor kidney in SimUNetSM reflect the decision-making outside a simulated environment and thereby, validate the use of SimUNetSM, we will test for correlations between choices observed in SimUNetSM and the deceased kidney donation turn down rates collected in Aim 2. If these correlations exist, we will examine whether the measurements from the experiment can independently explain the variation in acceptance rates across centers.Hypothesis 1: There exists a statistically significant relationship between clinicians deceased kidney turn down rates in practice and risk preferences observed in SimUNetSM. Overall Impact: Through this study, we will have 1. validated the use of SimUNetSM to elicit clinician behavior, 2. created a unique data set of the individual decision-making to accept a deceased kidney donation, and 3. have an understanding of the role risk preferences play in the decision-making process underlying the acceptance of deceased-donor kidneys. With the validation of SimUNetSM, we will have laid the ground work for future studies to evaluate the impact a wide range behavioral biases and preferences have on the likelihood of accepting a deceased-donor kidney. With a refined model of clinical decision-making, we can construct evidence-based policy and clinician decision-aids to improve the quality of care delivered in transplantation as well as increase access to deceased-donor kidneys.",
FP00024724,289,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary/Abstract Over 50% of US adults report unhealthy levels of stress. Middle-aged adults (45-64 years old) report greater and more frequent stress than older adults. Chronically elevated stress can impair normal diurnal cortisol patterns, which have been linked to a number of persistent health conditions (e.g., depression, cardiovascular disease, diabetes). Mindfulness meditation (MM) has gained increasing attention as an effective stress management technique. Recently, mobile apps have been explored as a way to deliver MM to reduce stress and overcome barriers to more traditional approaches as they may be more accessible and less stigmatized. There are currently hundreds of commercially available MM mobile apps lacking efficacy testing for stress management. Current RCTs testing commercially available MM mobile apps have a number of limitations including short duration (i.e. <30 days), lack of appropriate active app-based controls, high attrition, lack of adherence tracking and only utilize self-report measures of stress. There is a need to explore the effects of commercially available MM mobile apps to reduce stress during middle-age and address limitations of previous trials. This three-group, single-blind RCT will test the effects of two doses of a commercially available MM mobile app (i.e., Calm) to reduce stress in middle-aged (45-64 years old) adults with elevated stress (=15 on the Perceived Stress Scale) compared to a health education podcast control group (POD). Participants (N=450) will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (n=150 per group) for eight weeks: (a) Calm 10 (10 min/day), (b) Calm 20 (20 min/day) and (c) POD (10 min/day). Aim 1 will determine the effects of Calm on perceived stress (DASS-21) and biological stress (i.e., salivary cortisol). Aim 2 will examine the relationship between fluctuations in daily momentary perceived stress and Calm use measured with ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Aim 3 (exploratory) will investigate the optimal dose and duration of using Calm to achieve the maximum reduction in perceived and biological stress. We will achieve these aims by assessing: Perceived stress (DASS-21) at baseline, 1-wk, 2-wks, mid- (4-wks), 6-wks, and post-intervention (8-wks); salivary cortisol at baseline, mid- and post-intervention; daily perceived stress (EMA) at baseline, mid- and post-intervention (daily for 7-days at four random times). Findings from this study will 1) inform the public about evidence-based MM mobile apps to reduce stress, and 2) inform future research regarding optimal dose of MM delivered via mobile app. If effective, Calm can be easily disseminated to the public for immediate use.",

Control of the new coronavirus pandemic requires better, faster and cheaper diagnostics. Analysis of community wastewater has been identified recently in the literature as a powerful tool allowing for the rapid, inexpensive, large-scale, population-level screening of SARS-CoV-2, the infectious agent that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Hart and Halden, 20201,2,3). Goal. The goal of this project is to detect the presence and abundance of the new coronavirus in the Valley of the Sun at the city-area level via analysis of municipal wastewater. Obtained data will be shared immediately with decision-makers using a public health online dashboard previously established by our team in partnership with the city of Tempe, AZ. Approach. The project will entail a recurring sampling and analysis of wastewater produced in the Valley of the Sun over the course of the calendar months  May and June  2020. Resultant samples will be analyzed  in  OneWaterOneHealths  laboratory  space  in  the  Biodesign  Center  for  Environmental  Health Engineering at Arizona State University using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR), to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 via detection of its unique genetic fingerprint encoded in ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences. The project will engage a select cohort of municipalities in the Valley of the Sun willing to participate. A total of 100 measurements will be conducted and reported back to community stakeholders to inform public health decision-making for local management of the COVID-19 epidemic. At a minimum, the coronavirus survey of the Valley of the Sun will include the city of Tempe that previously had created the worlds first online dashboard for real-time sharing of public health data derived from wastewater-based epidemiology (https://arcg.is/ey0Ha). Also included in the survey will be the city of Guadalupe, AZ, whose city council recently voted to join the city of Tempes innovative use of biotechnology to facilitate a rapid, yet public health-protective economic recovery informed by wastewater analytics that provide data on the approximate number of anonymous infected individuals residing in or visiting local communities. Anticipated Outcomes. The project team will report the occurrence and levels of the new coronavirus at the neighborhood level (5 areas for a population of 185,000 people) for the city of Tempe and at the city-wide level for other participating communities (i.e., city of Guadalupe and others as applicable).

FP00024816,293,,,,,1,,,"Alzheimers disease (AD) can be viewed as a whole-body problem, although best characterized as a disease of the brain. There has been growing appreciation of the importance of the gut-liver-brain axis to AD, and dysfunctions in the liver and gut have been shown to interact with AD pathogenesis. Further, bioenergetic shifts involving fatty acid metabolism play a significant role in AD. The brain uses glucose as its primary fuel for energy production; however, reduced glucose transport and metabolism in the brain is an early and constant feature of AD. Under this energetic crisis, ketone bodies derived from fatty acids in the liver can be imported into the brain and used as the primary alternate fuel source. Consequently, development of AD may be influenced by whole-body fatty acid metabolism, rather than being an isolated condition of the brain. This proposal is inspired by our recent findings that decreased levels of a subset of fatty acids found in the brain, lauric acid in particular, correlate with AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. In addition, previous studies have shown the neuroprotective potential of coconut oil, in which lauric acid makes up ~50% of the fatty acids, on cognition and AD-related pathogenesis. However, mechanisms governing AD pathogenesis and its relationship to whole-body fatty acid metabolism are ill-defined. To at least partially address these fundamental gaps, we hypothesize that whole-body metabolic reprogramming, including fatty acid metabolism, is profoundly involved in AD development and progression. The overall objective of this study (short-term goal) is to further collect validation and mechanistic data in human subjects, and to establish whether 3xTg mice reproduce abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism along the gut-liver-brain axis, making them useful for exploration of mechanisms and testing of potential treatments. In Aim 1, we will validate dysregulated fatty acid metabolism in AD using a multi-omics approach on another independent sample set. Our working hypothesis is that decreased fatty acids levels in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD subjects will be accompanied by down-regulated fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and/or up-regulated fatty acid -oxidation (FAO), locally in the human brain. In Aim 2, we will determine AD-associated whole-body fatty acid metabolism and whether targeting it can intervene in AD using a mouse model. Our working hypothesis is that dysregulated fatty acid metabolism will exist along the gut-liver-brain axis, and that targeting those alterations through lauric acid supplementation can delay and/or alleviate AD pathogenesis. The expected outcomes include validation of our previous work in human tissues and the gain of additional insights into the mechanisms underlying whole-body fatty acid dysregulation in AD. Importantly, we will provide pre-clinical evidence establishing whether fatty acid supplementation can affect AD-associated outcomes. Successful implementation of this multidisciplinary study will lay the foundation for the future development of novel paradigms using lauric acid or other fatty acids to intervene in AD pathology in human subjects.",

Title:   Agriculture And Covid-19: Evaluating And Controlling Sars-Cov-2 Risks In The Food Supply Chain For Immediate And Long-Term Management Institution:  Arizona State University Institution:  Arizona State University Institution:  Arizona State University Institution:  Arizona State University Institution:  Arizona State University Institution:  Arizona State University Institution:  Arizona State University Institution: Usda-Ars (Subcontractor) PD:   Hamilton, Kerry CO-PD:  Halden, Rolf CO-PD:  Muenich, Rebecca CO-PD:  Varsani, Arvind CO-PD:  Scotch, Matthew  CO-PD:  Hogue, Brenda CO-PD:  Lim, Efrem Co-PD: Williams, Clinton   The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is a public health emergency wreaking havoc on global food supply chains. 90% of fresh leafy vegetables grown and consumed in the US are grown in Arizona. However, COVID-19-triggered demand reduction has already resulted in over 6 million heads of lettuce to be plowed back into the soil. Major outbreaks linked to contaminated irrigation sources in the past 2 years have also impacted the industry. To avoid further losses and ensure the safety of the nations food supply and agricultural workers, rapid strategies for predicting, preventing, and controlling viral exposures throughout agricultural supply chains are needed. Farmers utilize multiple potentially SARS-CoV-2-impacted sources to fertilize, irrigate, and/or provide process cooling for crops including biosolids, manure, reclaimed water, and surface water. Infected workers could also spread the virus or contaminate products through aerosols or surfaces if appropriate control measures are not implemented. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in human feces and municipal wastewater but has not been screened for in manure and irrigation water that will be applied to crops. Furthermore, the presence of RNA does not necessary mean there is live virus capable of causing an infection. We propose to screen fertilizer and irrigation sources for infectious SARS-CoV-2, to evaluate how well the virus survives and is spread throughout the supply chain, and to quantify risks for informing immediate risk management for the 2020 lettuce growing season as well as to increase agricultural resiliency to future pandemics.

FP00024835_Res1,295,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  About half of children in the U.S. experience parental divorce prior to age 16. Parental divorce confers risk for various mental health problems and disorders throughout the lifespan that incur significant individual and societal costs. Exposure to high levels of interparental conflict (IPC) accounts for much of this increased risk. The high prevalence of parental divorce, its significant public health burden, and the strong link between IPC and childrens mental health problems highlight the importance of interventions that reduce post-separation/divorce IPC. Many family courts mandate high-IPC separated/divorcing parents to attend interventions but none of the currently implemented interventions has been rigorously evaluated. Although two interventions have reduced IPC in divorced families in randomized controlled trials, neither has been adopted as a service by family courts, and thus are not reaching high-IPC parents. The current project represents a foundational step toward reducing the public health burden of parental divorce by developing and testing a scalable intervention to reduce IPC. It will use an established adaptation framework and human-centered design (HCD) methods to develop a relevant, useful, and engaging intervention for high-IPC parents that will be adopted and sustained by family courts. The project will adapt strategies from the two rigorously evaluated interventions that have reduced IPC; follow an established framework for adapting interventions; use HCD, which has been shown to improve effects and scalability of psychosocial interventions; and use state-of-the-art analytic techniques. We will analyze results from a survey of family court judges and administrators to determine the intervention format (i.e., digital, in-person, hybrid). In semi-structured interviews and focus groups, court-based service providers and high-IPC parents will provide qualitative and quantitative data about the intervention content and engagement strategies. These data will be used to develop a prototype of the intervention. Input from an advisory board, which consists of a judge, an administrator, a service provider, and four parents, and data from user testing sessions with parents and service providers will be used to refine the intervention. The randomized pilot will consist of parents mandated by judges to attend the new intervention or the existing court program. Parents will opt in or out of the research component. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to collect data on acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and usability as well as parents use of the intervention skills. Before and after participation, parents will complete questionnaires on IPC and child mental health problems. The specific aims are to: 1) Use HCD methods to develop an intervention that fits with the family court and is contextually appropriate for high-IPC separated/divorcing parents and 2) Pilot test the intervention with high-IPC families ordered to attend by the court. This proposal advances NIMHs strategic plan (3.2, 4.2), which encourages investigators to adapt existing interventions to optimize outcomes and leverage effective research-practice partnerships with stakeholders to develop scalable interventions.

FP00024860,296,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary/Structured Abstract Title: Development and Testing of EYEPlay Online Online: An Innovative Approach to Providing Virtual Professional Development in Drama-Based Instruction to Distance Learners. Topic: Early Intervention and Early Childhood Education Project Type: Development and Innovation Project Summary Purpose: This proposal seeks funding to develop, iterate, and pilot an online delivery method of Early Years Educators at Play (EYEPlay), an existing research-based professional development program for early childhood educators. EYEPlays programmatic goal is to increase teachers application of drama-integrated instruction during story time to improve the language and socioemotional skills of preschool children so they are ready for kindergarten. The goal of this project is to create a virtual professional development model, EYEPlay Online, which will (a) expand access to learning for small town and rural (STAR) teachers who are typically underserved in opportunities for professional development; and (b) allow continued access to professional development for all teachers during times of limited contact, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. Project Activities: The project will focus on restructuring the existing EYEPlay professional development model to meet the specific needs of remote learning for ECE communities. The proposed project will consist of five phases:    Phase 1: conduct a skills/needs assessment of STAR preschool teachers; based on the literature, identify best practices for online professional development; modify existent arc of learning and program components; build online infrastructure, including website and virtual classrooms; conduct a small pilot study with 2-3 teachers   Phase 2: develop the core learning modules, Dynamic Reading, and Pantomime; revise and extend the core learning modules using a design, test, and redesign development framework   Phase 3: develop and test the self-directed Story Activation mini-units: Group Storybuilding, Teacher-in-Role, and Traveling Pantomime; revise and extend the mini-units using a design, test, and redesign development framework   Phase 4: implement full EYEPlay Online model with the cohort of 40 teachers   Phase 5: conduct a pretest-posttest design pilot study of full EYEPlay Online PD implementation to ascertain teacher and student change along with intervention costs. The fifth phase will conclude with revisions resulting in a complete intervention. Products: This project will result in a fully developed virtual model of the EYEPlay program designed to meet the needs of STAR ECE practitioners. Final products will include a clear arc of learning, curricular materials, fidelity measures, a clear assessment of the costs and technology requirements for delivery at scale, and data from a pilot study indicating changes in teacher and student behavior and achievement. Structured Abstract Setting: The proposed Early Learning Programs and Policies topic area development and innovation project will take place in fringe and distant small towns and rural (STAR) areas of Arizona. For the project we use the definitions of distant STAR areas provided by the NCES Locale Classifications (NCES, 2015).  Population/Sample:  Based on the locale framework, we will recruit schools and require that participating STAR schools are categorized as fringe or distant. Participating preschool teachers will be recruited from within participating schools and children from within classrooms. Several of our targeted school partners serve primarily Hispanic (e.g., Casa Grande Elementary School District) and Native American (e.g., Salt River Schools) communities with rates of free and reduced lunch greater than 90%.   Intervention/Instrument/Factors: This proposal seeks funding to develop, iterate, and pilot an online delivery method of Early Years Educators at Play (EYEPlay), an existing research-based professional development program for early childhood educators. EYEPlays programmatic goal is to increase teachers application of drama-based instruction (DBI) during story time to improve the language and socioemotional skills of preschool children so they are ready for kindergarten. The goal of this project is to systematically create EYEPlay Online a virtual professional development model.  Research Design and Methods: The proposed development and innovation project will occur in five phases. The design of EYEPlay Online will be formatively and summatively evaluated using the Instructional Systems Design (ISD) method described by the ADDIE model. This iterative design model will guide the systematic development of the EYEPlay Online and result in a fine-tuned set of DBI PD experiences.  Key Measures: In the formative evaluation phases of the project the focal measures are the usability and feasibility perceptions of teachers and classroom observations of the teachers DBI. In the summative evaluation phase the key measures of interest at the teacher level are teacher drama-based instruction skills, beliefs and efficacy and at the student level story comprehension and emotional knowledge.  Data Analytic Strategy: Pretest-Posttest teacher perceptions and application of DBI and preschool student comprehension of unique stories will be analyzed using general linear model extensions of repeated measures analyses.  Cost Analysis: This cost analysis will help understand costs associated with implementing and maintaining the intervention at the teacher level. In addition, we will examine the implementation and maintenance costs in relationship to percentage increase in student performance.  ",
FP00024865,297,,,,,1,,,"Community Health Clinics (CHC) in Arizona (AZ) struggle to deliver high quality primary care every day due to a fragmented healthcare system and high proportion of vulnerable patients, including Hispanics and Native Americans, who are on Medicaid. Due to the underlying number of at-risk patients and scarce resources for primary care in AZ, the COVID-19 crisis has hit particularly hard. Patients not only have greater health risks, they are more likely to be affected by food insecurity, the digital divide, caregiver stress, unemployment, loss of insurance, language barriers, and the cost of healthcare. Some CHCs have responded to this resource-challenged environment by adopting innovative care strategies that are pro-active, patient centered, and integrated. The COVID-19 crisis has revealed the critical need to address barriers, evaluate what works well, and invest in successful strategies in population health. The time is now to identify, codify, and examine innovative adaptations to healthcare delivery, and their impact on prevention and care of COVID-19 as well as continuity of care and chronic disease management during COVID-19 in racial/ethnic and other vulnerable populations. Importantly these strategies and experiences implementing them need to be shared with the other AZ CHCs to improve their ability to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, respond to future crises, and respond more effectively to the everyday crisis of delivering healthcare in a high risk, resource scarce environment. We propose a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) led Type 3 Hybrid effectiveness study using a quasi-experimental design. We will compare primary care related COVID and Chronic Disease Management outcomes across 23 CHCs with different innovative adaptation practices pre and post COVID. Our hypothesis is that CHCs with a greater number of innovations that are implemented to a greater extent, with quality and equity will have higher quality of care post COVID. Our specific aims are to:  1) Identify innovative strategies for the prevention, testing, referral, and treatment of patients at risk for developing COVID-19, as well as for the continuity of care and chronic disease management for new and/or existing patients during COVID; 2) Assess key characteristics of the implementation, reach, and effectiveness of these strategies on vulnerable populations; 3) Establish a Leaning Healthcare Community System (LHCS) to improve the health care management of Medicaid populations.We plan to conduct 40-50 key informant interviews in 6 CHCs identified as having previously performed highly due to innovative management strategies. We next plan a modified Delphi Panel, as a tool to establish priorities and reach consensus across a group of experts for quality improvement strategies or other system changes. In the second phase, we will administer a one-time survey guided by the RE-AIM framework to all clinic managers at the states 23 CHCs to assess the implementation of the innovative strategies prioritized by the Delphi panel. To address effectiveness, we will link CHC use of these strategies with claims, EHR data and CMS performance measures for COVID-19 prevention and chronic disease management. Health care delivery analysis will examine whether implementation of a strategy is associated with COVID-19 related care (testing, ED visits, hospitalizations), or chronic disease CMS performance (eg HbA1c for diabetes, medication refills for hypertension), or behavioral conditions (eg antidepressants and therapy for depression) ED visits, or hospitalizations. We propose to build upon this initiative with our partners Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers (AACHC), Collaborative Ventures Network, Arizona Healthcare Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), and data partners Health Current and ASU Center for Health Information Research (CHiR), and patients, to form a LHCS. The LHCS will house a toolkit of case studies, training materials, protocols, and practice guidelines that can be used by other interested parties. This will allow CHCs in Arizona to learn through rapid-cycle tests of the delivery of care about novel strategies that work, implement them across the LHCC to ultimately improve health and healthcare quality and spending in the community.  Our proposed study will develop actionable findings on innovative primary care health management strategies in the time of COVID and their relationship to performance outcomes. In this way we will address a current knowledge gap and increase the evidence for feasible adaptations in healthcare that can improve the quality of care during and post COVID.",
FP00024898,298,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary/Abstract   Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide.  The challenges remain for the  treatment  of  immunologically  cold  and  metastatic  tumors.  Oncolytic  bacteria-based  therapy  has  been extensively  studied  in  recent  years  to  fill  the  critical  unmet  needs  of  cancer  patients,  where  the  current treatment  options  have  been  exhausted.  The  unique  features  of  our  genetically  modified  Salmonella  (GMS) enable  them  to search  for cancer cells and  tumors,  destroy  tumors, and  then  eradicate  themselves  from  the host  after  serving  the  purpose  of  treatment.  Cancer  stem  cells  (CSCs) are  a  driving  force  in  tumor  initiation, progression,  metastasis,  and  drug  resistance.  We  discovered  that  in  addition  to  promoting  immune  evasion, cancer cell constitutive expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) partakes in CSC maintenance and expansion via maintaining leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LgR5) expression. It consequently leads to -catenin signaling pathway activation in cancer cells. The blockage of PD-L1 function using  antibodies  inhibits  disease  progression  by  reducing  the  CSC  population  in  both  colorectal  and  breast tumors. Our data indicate that PD-L1, LgR5, and -catenin signaling form a positive feedback loop to promote CSC  formation  and  expansion.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  explore  a  Salmonella-based  cancer  treatment approach  that  combines  effective  targeting  of  tumor  cells,  appropriate  activation  of  the  immune  system,  and selective  inhibition  of  CSC  expansion.  The  success  of  our  efforts  would  turn  microbes  to  appropriate  onsite attackers of the cancer cells, activators of the immune system, and inhibitors of the CSCs, for effective cancer therapy to be successful and applicable across a wide range of tumor types.

FP00024916,299,,,,,1,,,"Preventing Veteran Suicide in Arizona through Community-Based Upstream InterventionsPurpose: The purpose of this project is to reduce the veteran suicide rate in Arizona using a comprehensive public health approach to identify vulnerable populations supplemented with novel techniques to assess suicide risk and protective factors. The primary outcome is a 10% reduction in the Arizona veteran suicide rate. Other outcomes include a reduction in suicide attempts, increased protective factors, and reduced risk factors. In addition, we will develop a framework to accelerate the adoption of effective interventions in other states across the U.S.Strategies and Approach: We will develop and implement a suicide prevention Strategic Action Plan to for Service Members, Veterans, and their Families (SMVF). Our Strategic Action Plan consists of three strategies: Strategy 1) identify disparities in deaths by suicide and vulnerable veteran populations and implement customized programs, Strategy 2) determine the impact of an upstream suicide prevention model, and Strategy 3) develop a framework for disseminating a state-level upstream veteran suicide prevention model to other communities in the U.S. Each program for the prioritized veteran populations will be based on the CDC Technical Package. We will use two novel approaches to increase the accuracy and precision for identifying vulnerable veteran populations: 1) adopt a Veteran Suicide Vulnerability Index (VSVI), and 2) use Geographic Information System (GIS) data to identify locations (hotspots) of vulnerable veteran populations in Arizona.Background: The suicide rate for veterans is 1.5 times the rate for non-veterans in the U.S., and Arizona ranks among the highest states in veteran suicide with a rate of 44.9 per 100,000, significantly higher than the national veteran suicide rate of 31.0 per 100,000. Key disparities in the Arizona veteran population include female veterans (almost three times the suicide rate of non-veteran females), younger veterans (almost four times the suicide rate of non-veteran age group), and rural-dwelling veterans (over five times the suicide rate in some locations).Collaborations: This proposed project is a close partnership of three organizations with a long history of working together: Arizona State University (ASU), the Arizona Coalition for Military Families (ACMF), and the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS). The ACMF is a nationally-recognized veteran suicide prevention best practice model for state level collaboration and capacity building based on the Collective Impact Model (CIM). We also have strong partnerships with all key statewide project partners including the Arizona Department of Veterans Services, Arizonas Medicaid agency, ASU Center for Violence Prevention & Community Safety, TriWest Healthcare Alliance, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In consultation with CDC, we will also identify other programs and organizations internal and external to CDC for the success of this project. Using community-based participatory design principles, we will work with these stakeholders in every phase of the proposed project. Our approach engages stakeholders at three levels: governance, operational, and key informants. They will be involved on the Veteran Suicide Prevention Advisory Board (VSPAB) to work directly with project leadership, five stakeholder committees to accomplish all strategies and activities, as well as individual veterans representing specific vulnerable populations.Impact: We will determine the impact of the upstream veteran suicide prevention efforts with three evaluation strategies: formative evaluation of the new program targeting vulnerable veteran populations, implementation evaluation of our current program, and outcomes evaluation of current and new programs to assess impact.",

FP00024971,302,,,,,1,,,"SPECIFIC AIMS: The impact on childrens weight status of a prolonged school closure of the magnitude mandated by the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. While students in younger grades tend to gain weight at a higher rate during summer recess, we have little basis for predicting the long-term effects on obesity prevalence of a hiatus of 6 months or more as posed by the current pandemic. Determinants of excess weight gain during school closures are yet to be fully understood, but prevailing literature points to positive energy balance resulting from poor diets, lack of structured activity, and increase in sedentary time. During the school year, low-income children comprise over 80% of students who participate in federal school-meal programs that fulfill up to half of childrens daily nutritional needs at low or no cost to parents. The nutritional quality of school meals has improved over the years, and participation in school meal programs is associated with healthier dietary patterns and weight outcomes among children. Absence of school meals during the summer has been cited as a potential reason for poor diet quality and higher rates of weight gain. While summer meals are provided to some students through the federal summer meals programs, research establishing the adequacy of these programs in addressing weight status is lacking. Pursuant to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127), the USDA extended the summer feeding program to deliver meals to children during the pandemic-related school closures; the USDA also authorized emergency food assistance through Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) cards for out-of-school children who qualify for school meals programs. Understanding the short- and long-term impact of COVID-19-related school closures on childrens weight status as well as the potential of child targeted food assistance programs to mitigate these negative outcomes is critical to our preparedness to respond to future disasters. This assessment is particularly critical because food insecurity rates during COVID-19 have greatly increased, further challenging low-income families ability to meet their childrens nutritional needs when schools are out. Our proposed study addresses these gaps in knowledge, relying on the unique circumstances posed by the coronavirus pandemic and our 7 years of professionally measured heights and weights of low-income students in over 100 schools in four cities in New Jersey. Our study has two specific aims:Aim 1: Examine the short- and long- term impacts of COVID-19 school closures on childrens weight status. H1: Childrens weight status (measured by BMI Z-scores and BMI percentile) in the post COVID-19 school year (2020-21) will be less healthy compared to similar measures in prior years, independent of the contributions of child- and school-level demographic characteristics and elements of the school and surrounding community food and physical activity (PA) environments. H2: Excess weight gain during COVID-19 will result in persistently higher weight status two years following the COVID-19 hiatus, compared to levels prior to the pandemic, controlling for contributions of child- and school-level demographics and elements of the school and surrounding community food and PA environments.  Aim 2: Assess if access to child-targeted food assistance, implemented during the pandemic, had a protective effect on childrens post-COVID-19 weight status. H3: Children with greater access to summer meals (number of meals served in their schools catchment area during COVID closures) will have healthier post-COVID weight status compared to children who had less access, accounting for school and community level covariates including school enrollment.H4: Children who attend schools with higher eligibility for P-EBT assistance (proportion eligible for free and reduced price meals) will have lower post-COVID weight measures compared to children from schools with lower eligibility for P-EBT, controlling for school and community level factors. To address these aims, we will draw upon our existing nurse-measured heights and weights data on children attending 120 public schools, collected during four school years (SY) between 2013-14 and 2019-20 (approximately 30,000 students per year) and add two more waves of data collection, one coinciding with the re-opening of schools (SY2020-21) and the other two years later (SY2022-23); these data will facilitate interrupted time series analyses of trends in weight status. Time-sensitive funding will facilitate initiation of measurement as soon as school resumes, which is essential to address the aims. For the same SYs, we will incorporate, as covariates, our annual data on schools food and PA environments that we have found to be associated with weight status, as well as measures of the surrounding food and PA environment known to affect obesity rates. New data on child-targeted food assistance in school catchment areas over the course of school closures will be collected to establish the potential mitigating effects of these programs. Impact The proposed study will make a unique contribution to our understanding of the long-term effects of a key dimension of federal obesity policy affecting low-income children, provision of free and reduced priced school meals. As such, the findings will be critical to our readiness to respond to future disasters and to our efforts to assure the adequacy of the food safety net.",

FP00024995,305,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY  The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented and rapidly evolving public health emergency. Vulnerable  populations,  such  as  people  who  use  illicit  drugs,  are  particularly  susceptible  to  adverse consequences during this time. Over the past few years, methamphetamine (MA) use has re-emerged as a significant  public  health  threat  in  the  US,  There  is  a  critical  need  to  improve  our  understanding  of  how  the convergence of risk environments in the context of complex emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impacts MA use practices and trends in a region, Arizona (AZ), that is at the forefront of the national concern over the increasing availability and use of MA. The proposed multi-PI, time-sensitive R21 study leverages an innovative  integration  of  ethnographic  methods  and  wastewater-based  epidemiology,  and  builds  on  the established  collaborative  partnership  with  the  city  of  Tempe  stakeholders.  The  overall  purpose  of  the proposed study in the city of Tempe, AZ, is to characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on MA use trends, associated health risks, and use of substance-dependence treatment services through mixed  methods,  community-engaged  research  that  integrates  qualitative  interviews  with  service providers  and  individuals  who  use  MA  alongside  wastewater-based  tracking  of  community-level indicators of MA use. Importantly, wastewater sampling in Tempe, AZ has been ongoing continuously since May 2018, providing an unprecedented opportunity to assess the levels of MA use over time in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. Key aims are to: Aim 1: Characterize the impacts of COVID-19 on MA and other drug use,  health-related  risks,  substance  use  treatment  and  other  service  use  through  community-based ethnographic research involving service providers (n=12) and individuals who use MA (n=40) in the Tempe, AZ area.  Aim  2:  Analyze  and  compare  temporal  and geographic  trends  in  the  concentrations  of MA  and  other drug  indicators  in  wastewater  from  Tempe,  AZ  before  and  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (May  2018   December  2021).      Aim  3:  Integrate,  interpret  and  disseminate  ethnographic  and  wastewater-based  data through  in-depth,  qualitative  interviews  (n=8)  and  partnership  building  process  with  the  key  stakeholders  in Tempe, AZ. The study will have a high public health impact because the findings will help service providers and other key stakeholders gain an initial timely perspective on policy, program, and practice needs and will inform  decisions  about  mobilization  of  needed  resources  (e.g.,  locating  mobile  units,  crisis  response, permanent treatment centers) to address adverse health consequences of converging MA use and COVID-19 outbreaks in a geographic area long known as one of the nations centers for MA misuse and distribution.

Vulnerable populations, such as people who use illicit drugs, are particularly susceptible to adverse consequences during this time. Over the past few years, methamphetamine (MA) use has re-emerged as a significant public health threat in the US, There is a critical need to improve our understanding of how the convergence of risk environments in the context of complex emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impacts MA use practices and trends in a region, Arizona (AZ), that is at the forefront of the national concern over the increasing availability and use of MA. The proposed multi-PI, time-sensitive R21 study leverages an innovative integration of ethnographic methods and wastewater-based epidemiology. The overall purpose of the proposed study (conducted in the Tempe, AZ, area) is to characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on MA use trends, associated health risk behaviors, and health service use through mixed methods research that integrates qualitative interviews with service providers and individuals who use MA alongside wastewater-based tracking of community-level indicators of MA use. The study builds on a transdisciplinary collaboration between the College of Health Solutions, the Biodesign Institute, and the Center for Applied Behavioral Policy at Arizona State University. It draws on an established partnership with the city of Tempe and key community stakeholders. The key aims of the proposed study are: AIM 1: Characterize the impacts of COVID-19 on use of MA and other drugs, health-related risks, substance use treatment and other service use, and overall wellbeing and resiliency through community-based ethnographic research involving service providers and individuals who use MA in the Tempe, AZ area. AIM 2: Analyze and compare temporal and geographic trends in the concentrations of MA and other drug indicators in wastewater from Tempe, AZ before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2018  December 2021). AIM 3: Integrate, interpret and disseminate ethnographic and wastewater-based data in partnership with the community members, behavioral health providers and policy makers. The study will have a high public health impact because the findings will help guide policy makers and treatment professionals regarding the impact of COVID-19 on MA use trends and health-related risks in a global epidemic that is without precedence and still unfolding.",

FP00025012,309,,,,,1,,,"Technical Abstract: The public health impact of the novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is affecting the mental, economic, social, and career well-being of entire communities, particularly true for communities of color, with American Indian/First Nations people bearing a disproportionate burden. In the Southwest specifically, the Navajo Nation experienced morbidity and mortality rates early on that are among the highest per capita of any U.S. state. The outsized incidence of COVID-19 in Indian Country has unveiled and magnified preexisting systemic inequalities among tribal communities, where gaps in accessible and affordable healthcare, essential goods, electricity, running water, and secure housing have been driving biopsychosocial determinants of public health for over a century. While other parts of the nation shift gears to prepare for COVID-19 recovery, vulnerable regional tribal communities remain stuck in states of emergency, without adequate testing, personal protective equipment (PPE), or the personnel necessary to adequately track, isolate, and care for positive cases. As a result, tribal and health system leaders in Indian Country are being forced to make time-sensitive decisions about where to focus available energy and resources (e.g., federal dollars). It is difficult- or even impossible-however, for key stakeholders and policy makers to understand the current context of care, or make informed policy and health decisions across tribes and nations, due to challenges in the way health and healthcare data on American Indians is collected, stored, and shared in disparate and largely not interoperable systems across a variety of Indian Health Services (IHCS), government, and private settings.The proposed study aims to gather input from key stakeholders (e.g., tribal and health system leaders, policy makers, and members of vulnerable populations) in Arizona to develop compelling evidence regarding the benefits and harms of different strategies and inform health policy and investment decisions surrounding the distribution of population health resources. Specifically, we propose to use a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) approach that is tailored for native communities, we will work collaboratively with and engage stakeholders over the course of 24 months to: 1. Determine the extent to which COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted American Indians in Arizona with regard to access to primary care, behavioral health, and other routine care, quality of care, and cost; 2.  Identify the patient-, provider-, and system-level factors that initially drove and continue to worsen disparities in COVID-19 testing and management, and other acute and chronic disease management, treatment, and outcomes for vulnerable tribes in Arizona; and 3. Build a shared understanding around which health care infrastructure and research needs are likely to have the highest impact on the health and well-being of these populations to prepare for the future. The target population will include all American Indians residing in Arizona. Initial stakeholder involvement will focus on tribal communities with the greatest perceived needs and with whom we have the closest working relationships. We propose to bring together representative stakeholders from 6 key vulnerable regional tribal populations in Arizona (Navajo, Hopi and the 4 sister nations) interested in participating. We will incorporate evidence regarding equity issues in the health care system of the future, Health Care without Walls, viewed as a health-inducing system that worked to keep people as healthy as possible and that came to people, meeting them where they are, in their homes, workplaces, or elsewhere in their communities.  Expert groups, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), in Achieving Health Equity in Preventive Services recommend a range of clinical preventive services for persons at average risk for disease. These are examples of evidence syntheses and expert guidelines which will influence scenario planning.The data aggregation of key datasets will require active engagement of stakeholders since tribal healthcare is received in a variety of Indian Health Service (IHCS), Government and private settings.  We plan on partnering to obtain IHS Resource Project Management System (RPMS), Urban Tribal Data System, Tribal Epidemiology Data and other unique healthcare datasets. These will be supplemented by statewide Medicaid claims data (Arizona Healthcare Cost Containment System, AHCCCS), US census data, Indian Health Service data and electronic health record data from across Arizona (Health Current, Arizonas Regional Health Information Exchange) where appropriate. The Decision Theater (DT) is an Arizona State University resource supporting and enabling research activities through data visualization, predictive modeling, and expert multidiscipline and stakeholder analytics. The CBPAR approach will partner key community stakeholders with relevant scientists, policy makers to inform these questions. Using best practices of the Learning Healthcare Communities (LHCC) model would be built upon the LHS archetype. The long-term goal of this partnership is to assist Arizona tribes and eventually other underserved populations in visualizing data on alternatives, in order to plan systematic investments in health care, population health and innovative solutions, as well as further research to prevent these health disparities in the future.",
FP00025073,310,,,,,1,,,"Abstract Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing a tremendous health threat and socioeconomic burden, especially in the US. Importantly, in addition to age and gender, COVID-19 has strong racial and ethnic health-related disparities. To reduce such a huge burden of COVID-19  health disparities, understanding the underlying mechanisms, especially at the molecular level, is critically needed.  COVID-19  can  induce  wide  and  extensive  alterations  in  metabolism,  which  can  provide  a  promising opportunity to develop early diagnosis and intervention. Notably, vitamins, especially vitamins C and D, play an important role in regulating the immune responses to viral infections, and they may contribute to COVID-19 health  disparities.  Therefore,  in  this  proposal,  we  hypothesize  that  blood-based  metabolites  and  gene expression, especially those in vitamin metabolism, are associated with COVID-19 health disparities, for both severity and prognosis. The overall objective is to use an integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics approach to  evaluate  gene  expression  and  metabolites  in  blood  samples  from  European  Americans  (EAs),  African Americans  (AAs),  and  Hispanic  Americans  (HAs),  in  an  effort  to  enable  a  more  complete  mechanistic understanding of the biology that underlies COVID-19 health disparities.  In Aim 1 (severity), a single blood sample (First Blood Draw) will be drawn from each recruited EA, AA, and HA subject (controls and COVID-19 patients with different severity). Demographic and medical information will be recorded, and the samples will be measured using metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches, with a special focus on vitamins. We will identify differentially expressed genes and metabolites associated with COVID severity and ethnicity using other demographic and clinical factors as covariates. Importantly, we will correlate our multi-omics data with immunological parameters to have a better understanding of infection processes. After the First Blood Draw in Aim 1, once a patient has a significant change in COVID-19 symptoms, another blood sample will be collected from this patient (Aim 2, prognosis). Subjects will be classified into two groups: Better and Worse. Using multi-omics data from both First and Second Blood Draw, we will identify differentially expressed genes and metabolites associated with disease progression and ethnicity. We will aggregate these results to identify significantly dysregulated pathways as the disease progresses indicated by immunological parameters.  Furthermore,  we  will  build  a  machine-learning  model  to  predict  disease  progression  using demographic, clinical, and molecular signatures as prognostic factors.  Successful implementation of this multidisciplinary study will lay the foundation at the molecular level, for a better  understanding  of  COVID-19  health  disparities.  Ultimately,  our  long-term  goal  is  to  identify  molecular vulnerability that could be used for early diagnosis, as well as developing precise and personalized intervention, which has significant potential to reduce COVID-19 health threats and disparities.

FP00025134,316,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary/AbstractWith telepractice becoming an increasingly popular, indeed necessary, alternative to clinic visits, speechlanguage pathologists (SLPs) evaluate speech that is audio captured and transmitted remotely via ateleconferencing solutions (e.g. Zoom). All popular teleconferencing applications use speech compressionalgorithms based on linear predictive coding (LPC) to reduce bandwidth required for speech transmission. LPCcompression algorithms decompose speech into phonatory source and articulatory filter parameters, which arethen independently vector quantized and temporally smoothed based on schemes that have been developedand optimized for compressing speech sampled from the general population. In this way, speech is transmittedwith the least number of audible artifacts and the highest level of intelligibility for the given internet connectionconstraints.Because LPC algorithms are optimized using large corpora of typical speech, they are fundamentallynot well-suited for faithfully transmitting the amount of distortion or noise commonly present in the dysarthricspeech signal, and articulation and voice features are particularly vulnerable to corruption. In this proposal theaim is to systematically characterize the impact of speech compression algorithms commonly used intelepractice platforms on speech intelligibility, perceptual evaluation, and acoustic measurement. This is donevia two aims:SA1: Evaluate the effects of teleconferencing speech compression algorithms at three internetbandwidth levels on the perceptual and acoustic assessment of dysarthric speechExisting high-fidelity audio recordings of words and sentences, and sustained phonations from 20 speakerswith various dysarthrias will be encoded at three compression rates to simulate low-, moderate-, and highbandwidth internet connectivity. Twenty experienced SLPs will transcribe the samples to attain intelligibilitymeasures for the original and encoded words and sentences; and perceptually rate vocal quality on sustainedphonations. Acoustic measures of articulation and voice will be extracted. Within-subject statistical models willevaluate impact of bandwidth condition on perceptual and acoustic outcomes within speech tasks.SA2: Compare outcomes for dysarthric speech recorded in a telepractice session (compressed) versusthat recorded simultaneously in-person via smartphone application (uncompressed).Fifteen speakers with dysarthria will participate in simulated telepractice speech assessments administered bySLPs. Subsequently, recordings from the session (compressed) and simultaneously recorded in-personsamples (uncompressed) will be scored by unfamiliar SLPs. Acoustic metrics will be extracted from allsamples. Within-subject statistical models will evaluate differences for the sample.The results of these studies will provide the first tranche of evidence to inform the limits of telepractice fordysarthria evaluation.",

Assessment of the true burden of disease in the population is needed for the prevention and mitigation of disease outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Currently, testing of new cases (via swabs) and those previously exposed (via serum) has limited reach in the population (<5%). However, an alternative approach relying on the analysis of community wastewater was recently demonstrated for the the city of Tempe, AZ and was shown in computer simulations to enable the repeated sceening of up to 70% of the US population on a weekly basis at <0.01% of the cost of clinical screening of individuals (2,3). As a population-wide infectious disease surveillance tool, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to complement current surveillance methods to better understand disease burden and how these burdens differ across communities. WBE surveillance of populations has been shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening (2). Wastewater-based epidemiology can provide a snapshot of the status of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and allows early detection, assessment, and management of the pandemic, potentially providing advanced knowledge of future rates of morbidity and mortality by using coronavirus levels in community wastewater as a leading indicator of things to come.  WBE has been demonstrated to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in public health response and prevention (2, 7-12). Most recently, the proposing team demonstrated the utility of a real-time dashboard displaying levels of the new coronavirus in US wastewater at the neighborhood level by example of the city of Tempe, AZ (3). The goal of the here proposed propject is to demonstrate the possibility of implementing WBE testing in the US more broadly in order to (i) assess in near real-time community spread of the new coronavirus, (ii) significantly increase both the fraction of the US population screened and the frequency at which this testing is being completed (weekly), (iii) compare novel coronavirus levels in wastewater with the burdens of infection, disease and mortality reported by local health systems, (iv) harvest metagenomic sequence data on SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral disease agents across the US, (v) optimize pipelines of metagenomic sequence analysis, and (vi) immedidately share any new knowledge gained with the research community and with the general public via an expansion of the beta-version online dashboard that was pioneered for the proposing team in collaboration with the city of Tempe, AZ.  DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH PLAN AND MILESTONES (INCLUDE DESCRIPTION OF COLLABORATION, IF RELEVANT): (NO MORE THAN 2 PAGES) RESEARCH PLAN This proposed collobrative project represents a partnership between the Jiang Laboratory of Intramural Research Program at NLM and three established NLM-funded PIs and their respective research teams at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University (Halden/Scotch/Varsani). The collaborative team will leverage an early-warning system for the detection of the seasonal flu (1R01LM013129-01) (4) and adapt it for nationwide, rapid, repeated, and economic Page  1   monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic variants using community wastewater as a diagnostic matrix. This project is shovel-ready as it will leverage previously developed, peer-reviewed strategies for population-wide virus monitoring, metagenomic sequencing, sequence analysis, and data communication originally developed for the seasonal flu to quickly provide a data stream and scientific resource for managing the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States. This cooperative project fully leverages the individual strengths of each team member to rapidly provide the essential information needed. Rapid Enrollment of Urban and Rural US Populations. The Halden lab at ASU previously developed over the course of 15 years, the largest US and global network of wastewater treatment plants participating in public health observation (4-6). We will select a sample of at least 25 major US cities and 25 rural cities/townships served by centralized wastewater treatment systems to reach a minimum of 16 million Americans or 5% of the US population. We will leverage existing contacts, material transfer agreements and standard operating procedures to obtain community wastewater in the form of 24-hour composite samples routinely collected by participating facilities for ongoing compliance monitoring. We will use established sampling, packaging and shipping procedures to receive weekly composite samples from each participating plant along with metadata on flow volume, wastewater temperature, average in-sewer hydraulic residence time etc to inform later analysis of the data (2). Upon next-day arrival of the refrigerated samples at the ASU laboratory, the samples will be immediately processed, analyzed and archived to become part of the Human Health Observatory (HHO) at ASU, the largest shared resource of archived municipal process stream samples in the US and worldwide (5). RT qPCR and Metagenomic Analysis for SARS-CoV-2. Upon arrival at the laboratory, weekly samples from municipalities from across the US will be immediately subjected to centrifugation, multiple filtration steps (0.45 m; 0.2 m), and ultrafiltration (10k Da cutoff filter). The resultant viral concentrate will be subjected to RNA/DNA extraction and RT qPCR using established WHO/CDC probes to determine presence and quantities of SARS-CoV-2. Viral RNA will be subjected to metagenomic sequencing and SNP analysis to explore genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants across the United States.  SARS-CoV-2 Levels as a Leading Public Health Indicato. The collaborative team of Jiang Laboratory of Intramural Research Program at NLM and the Halden/Varsani/Scotch team at ASU will collect community specific data on COVID-19 from public sources and statistically analyze associations between coronavirus levels in wastewater and recorded public health outcomes. These analyses will take into account important variables previously identified by our team, including wastewater temperature, in-sewer residence time of viruses, spatial scenarios of virus sheding in the monitored sewershed, etc (2). Data Dissemination. The collaborative team of Jiang Laboratory of Intramural Research Program at NLM and the Halden/Varsani/Scotch team at ASU will share resultant data with partnering cities and the research community. Depending on the preferences of the municipalities, data may be anonymized prior to data sharing and interpretation or data may be displayed on public dashboards similarly to the data communication strategy chosen by the city of Tempe, AZ.

FP00025215,319,,,,,1,,,"SenSE: Enabling Precise At-home Physical Therapy via Developing an Intelligent Wearable Sensor System  Overview Recent advances in sensing and networking technologies have made it possible to continuously acquire personal  health  data.  Still,  there  are  many  practical  barriers  to  capitalizing  on  such  advances  for achieving  precision  health.  Physical  therapy  has  been  routinely  used  in  prevention  and  treatment  of chronic  low  back  pain,  a  significant  heath  issue.  However,  presently  there  is  no  technology  to  reliably monitor compliance, ensure correctness, and track progress for unsupervised physical therapy at home. We identify two key technical challenges that impede the development of good solutions in this main: the system  challenge  and  the  inference  challenge.  To  address  these  challenges,  this  proposal  presents  a design-directed  development  of  a  novel  system  (for  addressing  the  first  challenge)  complete  with innovative machine learning or artificial  intelligence  algorithms (for addressing the second challenge) for achieving precise at-home physical therapy, in the domain of chronic low back pain. Our specific goal is to  design,  develop  and  pilot-test  a  novel  wearable  system,  with  integrated  hardware  (system)  and software (algorithms), for supporting and improving unsupervised physical therapy at home, employing a patient-centric  approach  by  explicitly  considering  usability  factors.  We  also  demonstrate  that  the  project exemplifies  general  design  and  engineering  principles  in  developing  practical  solutions  overcoming practical barriers in more general precision health contexts.   Keywords:  Precision  health; Physical  Therapy; Wearable  System;  Machine/Deep Learning;  Information Fusion; Spatiotemporal Models.  Intellectual Merit Although  technological  advances  have  made  it  possible  to  bring  personal  health  devices  to  the  home, much  more  is  needed  to  before  the  benefit  of  precision  health  may  be  reaped  at  home.  The  proposed work  will  bridge  a  significant  knowledge  gap  in  precise  at-home  physical  therapy  for  treatment  and prevention of chronic low-back pain, which is a significant health risk to the society. Our research efforts will  advance  knowledge  and  practice  in  the  domains  of  wearable  systems  for  healthcare,  embedded machine  learning/artificial  intelligence,  unsupervised  physical  therapy,  and  user  behavior  with  personal health  devices,  etc.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  problem,  we  employ  a  design-directed  approach  by explicitly addressing all aspects of the effort through innovative designs. The innovations in the proposed project collectively contribute to building a realistic system for  addressing a pressing real-world problem. The  proposers  have  on-going  research  efforts  preparing  the  team  for  addressing  the  challenges  of  the proposed  work,  including  studies  that  form  the  foundation  for  some  of  the  proposed  approaches.  The unique  composition  of  the  team  ensures  that  we  have  the  right  mixture  of  expertise  for  pursuing  the proposed efforts.   Broader Impacts  The proposed research  will have  broad impact on the development of intelligent  multimodal systems for precision  health  in  the  general  domain  of  at-home  healthcare  and  in  the  specific  domain  of  precise  at-home  physical  therapy  for  chronic  low-back  pain.  Because  of  the  increasing  adoption  of  personal healthcare devices, the potential impact of the proposed research is evident as it exemplifies the design and engineering principles for developing solutions in such a context. The work will also contribute to  the larger-scope  mission  of  precision  health  by  demonstrating  how  technical  and  practical  barriers  may  be overcome  through  design-directed  approaches.  The  proposed  research  will  impact  education  in  three ways.  First, students  will  be recruited  and  trained  for  both research and  for  participation  in  user  studies and these involved students/participants will be directly exposed to the leading edge of building innovative healthcare  devices.  Second,  the  research  tasks  and  findings  fit  in  well  with  our  existing  courses  on pattern  recognition,  machine intelligence,  human-computer interaction, movement science, exercise science,  ,  and so forth, further contributing to the investigators educational activities. Third, besides reporting our research findings in scholarly venues, we will employ a project website and other social media to publicize our research outcomes, with the goal of improving the publics understanding of technical advances for potential at-home healthcare applications. learning,  signal  processing,  artificial    ",
FP00025220,320,,,,,1,,,"In Brazil, cervical cancer is the third leading cause of female cancer mortality. Cervical cancer is preventable through timely screening and treatment of precancerous symptoms. While screening women for precancerous symptoms reduces their risk of developing cervical cancer, numerous barriers, such as embarrassment and the screening tests invasiveness, prevent some women from screening. In response, we are testing different methods to help overcome these barriers through encouraging women to screen themselves via cervical self-sampling. In this research study, we are studying the effectiveness and implementation of a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, randomizing at the public health primary care clinic level. We will enroll and randomize three primary care clinics that are each part of Brazils Unified Health System and participate in the Family Health Strategy, a program that provides integrated care for 67% of the countrys population. We aim to enroll 522 women (174 per study arm) between ages 25-65 who are not adherent to Brazils cervical cancer screening guidelines. Intervention Arm 1 participants will receive a mailed self-sampling kit. We will invite Intervention Arm 2 participants to enroll in the study at their local primary care clinic, where they will receive a kit for self-sampling at home. Control group participants will receive an invitation to screen for cervical cancer (via nurse-collected cervical sample) at their primary care clinic. Specific Aim 1 is to explore intervention reach and impact on the use of cervical self-sampling as compared to clinician-collected cervical cancer screening. Then, using mixed methods, we will explore the implementation of this self-screening intervention in primary care clinics. We will next explore what patients (Study Aim 2) and providers (Study Aim 3) think about this method of cancer prevention. We will use mixed methods (e.g., acceptability survey data, pre-post intervention survey data, in-depth interviews) to explore participants perspectives on this screening strategy and follow-up care. Through participant record data and key informant interviews with clinic community health workers and other healthcare providers, we will examine providers perspectives and realities of implementing this intervention. If this intervention demonstrates effectiveness and feasibility, we will use implementation findings to plan a larger cluster randomized controlled trial (R01), expanding the study to include additional regions and states in Brazil and a cost-benefit analysis component. Findings from this larger study may provide greater external validity for this cancer screening method and, in turn, inform healthcare delivery (e.g., self-sampling) in low- and middle-income countries that similarly offer universal coverage to provide care for lower-income populations who experience barriers to primary care.",

FP00025234,322,,,,,1,,,"Overview: Neurological disorders are the top cause of disabilities in later life and are expected to grow at unprecedented rates with the aging of the worlds population. In the absence of in vivo confirmatory diagnostic tests for most neurological diseases, neurologists rely on clinical examination to detect behavioral and cognitive signs and symptoms that are diagnostic hallmarks of these conditions. They rely on in-clinic examination and intuition to render decisions related to diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis; however, this process is fraught with challenges and misdiagnosis rates can be as high as 50% in early stages of the disease. This is because of the subjective nature of the examinations and the limited view of the symptoms that neurologists have by only performing in-clinic assessments. Fortunately, we now live in a world teeming with sensors that have the potential to provide objective and repeatable measures of behavior and cognition, collected at optimal intervals remotely, to allow for data-driven diagnostic, tracking, and prognostic models. In this Expeditions proposal, we bring together an interdisciplinary team of world-renowned experts for a concerted effort to push the field of AI for digital health into the realm of repeatable science. We propose to develop one of the largest cyberinfrastructures for digital health sensor data with linked clinical outcomes. This will enable the development of new foundations, algorithms, and systems that efficiently combine data across different modalities and levels of fidelity to generate interpretable and repeatable representations that are clinically-relevant.    Intellectual Merit: Our proposal brings to the fore several revolutionary advances. We will develop one of the most comprehensive cyberinfrastructures for neurological health monitoring spanning novel software platforms, clinical knowledge-bases, and clinical sensor data, which would serve as a focal convergent point for engaging the breadth of our technical and disciplinary expertise. This infrastructure will have a long-lasting impact as it will become available to the broader research community for several years to come, providing a continued source of data, knowledge-bases, and software. The research will not only include new mathematical developments in topological methods for parsimonious and interpretable representations, but also extend it to multi-modal and multi-fidelity data streams. We not only advance algorithms for time-varying and distributed digital health data, we also develop new mathematical frameworks that underpin continually adaptive and distributed representation learning using methods at the intersection of machine learning and information geometry. Taken collectively, the new theory, advanced algorithms, and availability of data at different levels of fidelity, will provide revolutionary new foundations for the interpretable, repeatable, and efficient delivery of remote digital health in general, and for neurological conditions in particular.  Broader Impact: Nearly 50 million people worldwide have Alzheimers or other dementias, with only 1 in 4 of those diagnosed and treated; this number is expected to go to ~120M by 2050 with costs of care surpassing $1 Trillion in the US alone. The earlier and more frequently patients engage with their neurologist, the better their quality of life and health outcomes; however, the data reveal longstanding racial, ethnic, and regional disparities in access and utilization of neurology services. This is a pending catastrophe with half the countrys population on track to be non-White by 2040. The infrastructure and algorithms we propose herein will enable new remote monitoring paradigms that, when combined with telemedicine platforms, remove geographic and cost barriers and broaden participation in healthcare. We also lay out an innovative plan for education and broadening participation by introducing a new online class and online modules on data science with applications to health. We will offer this class across three colleges (College of Health Solutions, College of Nursing and Health Innovation, and College of Engineering). In addition, we will also offer the course nationally for college credit via the ASU Open Scale program that allows individuals who are academically inadmissible to Arizona State University the ability to demonstrate college readiness and gain confidence in completing college-level courses prior to enrolling in a degree program.

FP00025293,324,,,,,1,,,"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). By early April 2020, the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) pandemic has led to more than 1.9 million confirmed infections and more than 120,000 deaths worldwide [2]. The economic impact is enormous. Due to the disease, the U.S unemployment rate soars to 14.7%, the worst since the Depression era. It is therefore important to find the molecular mechanisms of the disease transmission and infection, and the host responses. Huge amount of sequencing data was and will be generated from both the virus and COVID patients. With these abundant genomic and clinical datasets, it is imperative to develop deep learning-based methods to predict the risk factors associated with COVID-19. In this project, we will develop and apply two novel deep learning methods to identify key determinants of the virus infection and host response. Project aims: (1) We will develop a novel multi-channel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) method to identify genetic variants that are key to virus infection. The method will capture protein 3D spatial features surrounding a mutation, and can help us better understand the host genetics of fighting COVID-19 and repurpose drugs; (2) We will next develop a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) method to integrate multi-omics data to predict disease severity and combination of drug therapy. We will apply these novel methods to publicly available datasets, such as COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, the SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interaction Map, toxicity and synergy databases (National Institutes of Health  NIH), as well chemical and drug related data (DrugBank, Broad Institutes Drug Repurposing Hub. We will validate the predictions with our internal datasets from Mayo Clinic. The tools will be made publicly available to help other researchers develop COVID-19 treatments.",
FP00025298,325,,,,,1,,,"Optimizing Clinical Outcomes in Treatment of Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy  Significance and Aims.  Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults.  Arthritic changes in cervical spine lead to spinal cord compression and progressive neurologic symptoms, including hand numbness and weakness, loss of manual dexterity, gait difficulty, and imbalance.  Surgery is the mainstay treatment for CSM and has been shown to improve quality of life.[1]  However, large gaps remain in our understanding of CSM progression, the response to treatment at various stages of the disease, and the ideal treatment for individual patients.  As a result, there is significant variability in practice patterns regarding the timing of treatment and the types of treatment pursued.  The goal of this proposal is to determine which patients benefit most from surgical intervention and to understand the most appropriate surgical techniques for individual patients.  There are unique challenges in CSM which complicate diagnosis and clinical decision-making.  First, the symptoms of CSM are nonspecific, making it difficult to determine its relative contribution to functional status in the setting of other confounding illnesses, such as neurodegenerative disorders or musculoskeletal disease.[2]  Second, CSM has an insidious onset and slow progression of symptoms.  Surgery is the accepted form of treatment for advanced disease, but the ideal treatment for patients with milder forms of CSM is largely unknown.  There are advocates both for early surgery (as a preventative measure) and for nonoperative management with close observation.  For those that do undergo surgery, there are several established techniques (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, laminectomy with posterior fusion, and laminoplasty), as well as newer technology (cervical disc arthroplasty) with an as yet undefined role in CSM.  Many factors influence procedure selectionspinal alignment, the structures responsible for spinal cord compression, number of spinal levels involved, and patient comorbiditiesand while various treatment algorithms incorporating these factors have been proposed, they are based on weak evidence.    Clearly, more robust, high quality data is needed to guide treatment of CSM.  While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold standard for clinical research, very few RCTs have been conducted in this patient population.[3, 4] Among the many challenges of RCTs for CSM, they must maintain a well-defined population for treatment comparisons; this has limited generalizability of results to what remains a heterogenous patient population.  As a result, clinicians have come to rely heavily on results of retrospective studies and expert opinion. This topic is poised for registry-based, comparative effectiveness research that is more inclusive of the breadth of disease.  We propose a prospective observational study that will serve as the foundation for a data-driven approach to CSM treatment.  Patients will be enrolled at the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI), one of the highest volume academic neurosurgical centers in the country. We will collect clinical data, imaging results, patient reported outcomes measures, quantitative functional testing results, and detailed diagnostic and treatment data.   Data will be stored in a longitudinal, prospective registry at the BNI, and analytics carried out utilizing state-of-the-art mathematical modeling and deep learning algorithms with expert faculty in the Biomedical Informatics Division of the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University.  Results will provide guidance on best treatment strategies for different types of CSM patients and allow for the development of predictive algorithms to guide clinical decisions.  This approach will be applied to each of the following aims:   Aim 1:  Determine which CSM patients benefit from surgical intervention versus nonoperative management.  Understand patient signatures that predict favorable and unfavorable outcomes with surgery, with variables to include patient demographics, disease severity, neurologic deficit, comorbidities, and imaging characteristics.  Aim 2:  Define surgical techniques that provide the greatest benefit for individual patients. Compare and contrast surgical techniques and their impact on complications, spinal alignment, and functional recovery. Innovation:  The proposed CSM registry represents the most comprehensive dataset to date for this disease.  The database will be equiped with automated data import from the electronic medical record to allow for transfer of a high volume of discrete data in a cost-effective manner.  The high volume of structured data will ultimately allow for advanced analytics techniques such as deep learning for predictive analytics applications.   The database will include standard registry elements including clinical data, imaging results, and patient-reported outcomes measures.  However, the addition of CSM-specific functional assessments separates this proposal from other existing research efforts.  By evaluating hand grip, dexterity, balance, and gaitthe most common deficits observed in CSMwe will have a quantitative understanding of how CSM treatment impacts the most relevant patient functions.  A prospective pilot study recently completed by our group utilized quantitative hand function assessments and demonstrates the potential utility of these types of measures.[5]  Gait and balance will be assessed using inertial measurement units and smartphone-based applications pioneered by one of the investigators on our research team.[6, 7]  A very recent publication by our group describes some of the functional deficits that are observed in the spinal neurosurgery patient population.[ref]    Approach: Aim 1:  Determine which patients benefit from surgical intervention versus nonoperative management. Rationale:  CSM is a broad disorder and the diagnosis spans from mild disease with minimal symptoms to severe disease with major neurologic disability.  In this predominantly elderly population, there is also significant variability in general health and comorbidities which likely influence patient outcomes.  Optimal management for CSM likely varies based on 1) disease severity, and 2) individual patient characteristics.  Examples of variables of interest include age, body mass index, bone density, ASA classification, comorbidities, frailty index, severity of stenosis, dynamic motion on radiographs, spinal alignment parameters, patient-reported outcomes measures, and quantitative functional assessments of hand function, balance, and gait.  Through the prospective collection of these data, we seek to determine which patients benefit from surgical intervention versus nonoperative management.  Given the inherent selection bias for patients managed surgically versus nonoperatively, we will apply the matching strategies described below to generate comparable groups for analysis as described below.  Study 1.1: What presurgical factors predict favorable versus unfavorable outcomes with surgery?   We will determine the influence of various presurgical factors, such as age, comorbidities, frailty index, ASA classification, lab values, imaging findings, bone density, PROMs, and functional assessment results on favorable outcomes such as neurologic recovery and improvement in health-related quality of life metrics and unfavorable outcomes such as lack of neurologic improvement or neurologic decline, mechanical failure of the spine, surgical site infection, reoperation, medical complications, and death.  Ultimately, we are interested in developing predictive analytics algorithms for reliable prediction of surgical outcomes based on presurgical factors.  Study 1.2: What is the ideal timing for surgical intervention based on disease severity?   For this study, we are interested in understanding the ideal timing for surgery.  Optimal management of patients with mild disease is poorly understood and management decisions are variable and often not evidence-based.[8-11]  A primary objective of this study is to determine which factors predict when surgical intervention is likely to provide benefit for mild disease.   Close observation of patients treated nonoperatively will be used to examine the natural history of mild CSM and compare with patients treated with surgical intervention.  Matching will be used to generate equivalent groups for comparison.  Patients with moderate to severe disease are often considered for more urgent surgical treatment to halt the progression of symptoms and allow the best chance for neurologic recovery.  Some patients have remarkable recovery of function while others are left with permanent deficits.  A second objective of this study is to determine which presurgical factors have the greatest influence on neurologic recovery in moderate to severe CSM. CSM severity will be classified based on baseline modified JOA score, functional testing results, and imaging findings.  Clinical outcomes will be determined based on changes in PROMs and functional testing results.  We will also evaluate the correlation between changes in PROMs scores and quantitative functional testing results.    Aim 2:  Define surgical techniques that provide the greatest benefit for individual patients. Rationale:  A variety of techniques are commonly employed for the treatment of CSM.  Anterior techniques include anterior cervical discectomy with fusion and plating, anterior fusion with standalone constructs, and more recently the application of cervical disc arthroplasty.  Posterior approaches include laminectomy with posterior fixation and fusion and laminoplasty.  Various factors influence the decision on the approach and specific techniques employed.  Careful evaluation of that decision-making process and an understanding of the successes and failures of the techniques employed is needed.  The spinal implant industry is flooded with a plethora of devices and biomaterials with purported benefits many of which have not been validated.  For fusion surgery, there are also many types of bone graft options including autograft, demineralized bone matrix, cellular based allograft, and synthetic bone graft substitutes, such as ceramics.  As part of the registry effort, there will be detailed collection of all surgical techniques and implants used for post hoc analysis.  Categorical comparisons  between implant types, biomaterials, and surface architectures and their impact on clinical outcomes will be performed.  We will examine overall comparisons and also perform a matched analysis for patients with clinical equipoise.    Study 2.1: Which factors influence the decision to undergo anterior vs posterior surgery in a real world setting?  We will examine presurgical factors that influence the decision to perform anterior versus posterior surgery including spinal alignment, number of stenotic levels, bone density, body habitus, previous surgery, and surgeon preference.  Study 2.2: Which techniques lead to the greatest improvement in PROMs and functional testing?  We are intersted in understanding the influence of approach and specific surgical techniques on PROMs and quantitative functional testing.  Specific comparisons of interest include anterior versus posterior approaches, traditional anterior plating versus stand-alone interbody constructs, laminectomy with fusion versus laminoplasty, PEEK versus titanium interbody devices, and smooth versus textured and/or porous interbody surfaces.  Study 2.3: What is the perioperative complication profile for anterior, posterior, and combined surgery?  We will investigate the perioperative complication profile for anterior, posterior, and combined surgery. Common complications of CSM surgery will be evaluated including dysphagia, dysphonia, neurologic injury including C5 palsy, nonunion, adjacent segment disease, surgical site infection, CSF leak, readmission, and reoperation.    Study 2.4: How do different surgical techniques impact spinal alignment?  Do alignment changes predict clinical outcome?  There have been several studies illustrating that the normalization of cervical spine alignment parameters improves clinical outcomes.[12-14]  Anterior fusion is commonly associated with greater potential for restoration or maintenance of lordosis particularly in the setting of rigid kyphosis. However, given the expansion of anterior and posterior techniques and implant options, an updated analysis is warranted.  We will evaluate the impact of approach, implant type, and osteotomies on cervical spine alignment parameters.  Study 2.5: How do different surgical techniques impact fusion rates and reoperation rates?  We are interested in understanding the surgical factors that influence fusion rates and mechanical success or failure.  Specific comparisons of interest include anterior versus posterior approaches, traditional anterior plating versus stand-alone interbody constructs, PEEK versus titanium interbody devices, smooth versus textured and/or porous interbody surfaces, bone graft types, terminating distal posterior constructs at C7 versus extending into the thoracic spine, terminating proximal constructs at C2 versus the subaxial spine, C2 pedicle screws versus C2 pars screws, subaxial lateral mass screws versus pedicle screws.     Study approach Database development: The database infrastructure will be developed during the UG3 phase of the study.  A cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant platform will be used for housing all data.  Data fields will be defined according to the NINDS Common Data Elements.  Data sources will include the electronic medical record (EMR), the patient, and the clinical research team.  Application program interfaces (APIs) will be created to allow for automatic transfer of discrete data from the EMRs to the research database.  EMR data will include patient demographics, diagnoses (ICD-10 codes and diagnosis related groups), procedural codes (CPT), vital signs, medications administered, laboratory results, length of stay, patient disposition, amongst other data fields.  Patients will complete general health and disease-specific patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) including PROMIS physical function, PROMIS pain interference, PROMIS anxiety, PROMIS depression, neck disability index (NDI), NRS neck and arm pain, and modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA).  To minimize form fatigue and increase patient compliance the PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CATs) will be used.  Using an intelligent algorithm that dynamically selects questions based on previous answers, CATs allow for accurate scoring with as few as 4-6 questions.  The clinical research team, in collaboration with the providers, will be responsible for completing forms related to spine diagnoses, imaging findings, functional testing results, treatment details, and complications.  Structured forms with adequate granularity will be created for each category.  Clinical outcomes assessments including PROMs, functional testing, and imaging will be completed at baseline and at the following post-treatment intervals: 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months.  Functional testing protocol: A functional testing protocol to evaluate CSM-specific parameters will be developed during the UG3 phase.  Upper extremity assessment will include 9-hole peg test to evaluate hand dexterity and palmar dynamometry to evaluate hand strength, as previously described by our group.[5]  Gait and balance, which are also impacted in CSM, will be assessed using using inertial measurement units with a smartphone-based platform.  Using this technology, a variety of metrics can be obtained and compared from clinically-relevant functions, such as sit to stand transition, resting posture, and gait.[6, 7]  Expertise in this domain is also represented in our research team.  Patient Enrollment:  During UH3 phase, patients will be identified for enrollment in the outpatient neurosurgical clinics at the Barrow Neurological Institute.  All patients over 18 years of age with CSM will be eligible for enrollment.  Diagnosis of CSM must include: 1) imaging demonstrating cervical spinal cord compression, and 2) myelopathic signs or symptoms.  Objective signs of CSM include hyperreflexia (clonus, a positive Hoffman sign, a positive Babinski sign), spasticity, motor deficits in corticospinal tract distribution, atrophy of intrinsic hand muscles, gait instability, standing imbalance, sensory loss, and Lhermittes sign.  Symptoms of CSM include hand numbness, loss of manual dexterity, gross hand weakness with dropping of objects, upper extremity paresthesias, impaired gait, standing imbalance, lower extremity weakness, urge incontinence, and urgency of urination and defecation.  Table 1 lists historical data of CSM patients managed at our institution.  We have included the volume of patients and demographics of our patient cohort. CSM primarily afflicts an older patient population and affects patients of both genders.  Minorities are well-represented at the BNI, which is located in Phoenix, Arizona, and include Native American, Hispanic/Latino, and African American patients.  Endpoints:  There are a host of endpoints of interest for this proposal. Traditional endpoints will include scores on general health PROMs (e.g. PROMIS), cervical spine-specific PROMs (e.g. NDI, mJOA), complications, and radiographic findings.  Functional testing results (upper extremity, gait, and balance) will serve as a novel set of endpoints for CSM.  We will outline the primary and secondary endpoints for each study during the UG3 phase.  We will also allow for dynamic reassessment of endpoints during data analytics phase of the project.  Data Completion and Patient Retention:  A data auditing system will be developed and integrated into the database platform.  Scheduled reporting inquiries will alert the research team of all data elements that are due.  Missing data will be identified for collection by the research team with adequate notice within the respective time frames to maximize data completion rates.  Satisfactory data completion and long-term follow-up require patient cooperation and retention. During the UG3 phase, we will protocolize the necessary communication   Summary of Analytics Plan The proposed study will be a prospective observational study, not a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is the widely accepted scientific standard in biomedical studies.  The reasons for performing an observational study have been outlined above. Briefly, they are related to the selection bias inherent into the process of deciding which patients are managed surgically vs. non-operatively, and the inability to blind patients or healthcare providers to the type of treatment being provided. In the absence of a randomized assignment of treatments, estimation of the effect of treatment can be confounded by unknown, unmeasured, or inadequately measured covariates [15]. Many different methods have been proposed in the literature to assess treatment effects in observational studies. With all these methods, the main objective is to deal with the potential bias caused by the nonrandomized assignment of treatments [16]. Below we outline some of these approaches, grouped into 1. study design phase or 2. data analysis phase analytical methods. While some of methods could be attempted in the study design phase, further reduction of bias is needed in the data analysis phase [17].   Methods for Study Design Phase  A first type of methods for dealing with potential bias in a prospective observational study is to limit the control or treatment group in order to create more equivalent groups on one or several variables. This can be done by selection of subjects or by choosing a specific study design, as described below. 1.  Choosing for the untreated control group only subjects who would be otherwise candidates for the treatment under study. The selection of candidates for treatment can be conducted by a panel of physicians after presenting them the clinical characteristics of the patients in the study [18].  This approach can improve the comparison between the treated and untreated group. One potential challenge with this approach would be reducing power by using only a subset of potential subjects. This method, applied to the design phase, has some similarities to the use of propensity scores matching described further below in the data analysis phase section. 2.  Use of historical controls, i.e., previous patients that were untreated or had alternative treatments. This approach can increase the power by increasing the sample size. Using historical data, however, poses the usual time-related challenge that clinical data might be incomplete, or that characteristics of the study population might be different [19].   Methods for Data Analysis Phase 1.  Matching can be used to limit the effect of confounders by selecting cases and controls that have similar, i.e., matching, values for the confounding variable [20]. Typically, matching is done during the study design phase in a RCT. In an observational study such as the one proposed here, however, matching cannot be effectively performed during the design phase of the study due to the inability to randomize patients to treatment groups. In such circumstances, matching can be performed post-hoc, during the data analysis phase.  Given the inherent selection bias with patients managed surgically versus nonoperatively, optimal, nearest neighbor one-to-one propensity score matching with replacement will be employed to generate comparable groups for outcomes analyses [21].  Propensity scores can be particularly useful for observational studies of treatment efficacy to control confounding by indication, the problem that patients for whom a treatment is indicated (and prescribed) are often at higher risk, or otherwise different, from those who do not get the treatment [20]. Instead of adjusting for all factors that predict outcome, use of propensity scores involves creating a multivariate model to predict receipt of the treatment.  This model requires that potential confounding variables be identified and measured. Each subject can then be assigned a predicted probability of treatmenta propensity score.  The derived score, between 0 and 1, becomes the estimated likelihood of being in one treatment group vs. the other.  Subjects who did and did not receive the treatment can be matched by propensity score, and outcomes compared between matched pairs.  Matching and analysis will be performed use the matchit library [22] in the R statistical package.   2.  Stratification is another method that ensures that only treated and untreated individuals with similar levels of a confounding variable are compared [20].  Patients are divided into subgroups, i.e., strata, according to the level of a confounder, and the relationship between a predicting and outcome variable is investigated separately within each subgroup.  Typically, stratification is performed on one or two overt bias covariates, that are relatively easy to measure, e.g., smoking status [16]. This allows for the clear interpretation of the results, and makes no assumption, such as linearity, between outcome and confounder [23]. The limitation of stratification, however, is that, generally, only a small (one or two) variables can be used for stratification, which can be restrictive if there are many covariates. Another limitation is related to the choice of thresholds for separating individuals into strata, which can be arbitrary for continuous numerical variables. Due to these limitations, we expect that we will rely primarily on matching, as outlined in the previous section, and on the use of statistical and machine learning techniques, as described below, in our analysis.  3.  Multivariable statistical techniques  Risk Adjusted Regression [24] Multiple regression analysis is a typical approach to adjust for multiple confounders in observational studies [25]. Regression analysis uses mathematical modeling of the relationship between an outcome (dependent) variable and one or more independent variables. Formally, the model for multiple linear regression, given n independent variables, is y = 0 +  1x1 +  2x2 +  +  nxn + ,  where y is the dependent (outcome) variable, 0 is the intercept, xis are the independent variables, bis are the regression coefficients, and  is the error term. The independent variables xis can include both treatments and confounders, and are called covariates, explanatory or predictor variables. Each coefficient represents an estimate of effect or risk depending on the type of general linear model (e.g., mean difference for linear regression and log odds ratio for logistic regression) [25]. Frequently used approaches are multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards regression (survival analysis). The appropriate model depends on the type of outcome that is being assessed, as illustrated in Table 1. Multivariable statistical analysis will be performed use the R statistical package.   Table 1 Types of Regression Analysis  Model Linear Regression Logistic Regression Cox Proportional Hazards   Estimate of Effect Type of Outcome Example Mean Difference  Continuous Odds Ratio Binary Grip Strength Postoperative embolism Hazard Ratio Time To Event Time to readmission Summary of Study Data Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, counts, and percentages will be reported to summarize the study groups. The frequency and percentages (based on the non-missing sample size) of observed levels will be reported for all categorical measures. In general, all data will be listed, sorted, treatment and subject, and when appropriate by visit number within subject. All summary tables will be structured with a column for each treatment and will be annotated with the total population size relevant to that table/treatment, including any missing observations.  The team will routinely review the database, data structure, and data quality and where indicated, we will use multiple imputation or full-information maximum likelihood estimation under Missing at Random (MAR) assumptions [26]. Prospective cohort power analyses will be conducted using conservative effect sizes from previously published studies to ensure adequate sample size for inferential statistics. Average treatment effects will be estimated from propensity-matched samples to equalize observed baseline characteristics across treated and untreated participants [27].    Missing Data We will address missing data throughout phases of the projects, as commonly recommended [28]. In the study documentation and training of personnel, we will emphasize the importance of complete data at both the unit and item level. Our implementation plan will include time scheduled for staff to follow up with participants for data. We plan our technology to enable at least two follows up by staff under each modality (voice or text/email) for each participant. We will analyze for bias in the follow up versus original data and adjust our protocols to minimize the bias. We will monitor the extent of missing data throughout the collection phases and meet with stakeholders to identify any systematic issues at the item level. In the analysis, we will avoid complete case analysis. We plan robust analysis for MCAR (missing completely at random). Based on the level of missing data, we will evaluate MNAR (missing not at random) pattern mixture models [29] for adjustment in other cases. Data imputation and analysis will be performed using the mice package (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) [30] library in the R statistical package.   Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the possible influence of various input variables, such as deviations in treatment protocol, changes in methods of handling of missing data, changing the definition of outcome (e.g., different cut-off points), etc. [31]. Sensitivity analysis can be a valuable tool in assessing the possible influence of an unmeasured confounder in observational studies. The problem of nonrandomized assignment to treatments in observational studies can be thought of as a problem of unmeasured confounding factors. Instead of stating that an unmeasured confounder can explain the treatment effect found, sensitivity analyses try to find a lower bound for the magnitude of association between that confounder and the treatment.  The plausibility of the estimated treatment effects will increase if the estimated treatment effects are insensitive over a wide range of plausible assumptions about these unmeasured confounders. Lin et al developed a general approach for assessing the sensitivity of the treatment effect to the confounding effects of unmeasured confounders after adjusting for measured covariates in observational studies [32] and we will use this approach in our sensitivity analyses.  Safety Analysis and Adverse Events When calculating the incidence of adverse events, or any sub-classification thereof by treatment, time period, severity, etc., each subject will only be counted once and any repetitions will be ignored; the denominator will be the total population size. Adverse events will be summarized overall, by severity, seriousness, and by relationship to treatment. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals may also be provided for the comparison of serious adverse event rates between groups. The incidence of adverse events will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Each subject will be counted only once for each of the incidence rates, regardless of the number of occurrences (events) the subject experiences.  Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Solutions Matched propensity analyses may fail for subjects who cannot be matched because their propensity scores are close to 0 or 1. While this reduces sample size, it may be an advantage because in these unmatchable subjects the propensity score analysis has identified a lack of comparability between groups and inability to control for confounding that might not have been apparent with other methods of multivariable analysis.   A limitation of using propensity scores for matching is that it does not provide information about the relationship between any of the confounding variables and outcome. The only result is for the predictor (the treatment) that was modeled. However, because this is an analysis phase strategy, it does not preclude doing more traditional multivariate analyses as well, and both types of analysis will be performed.  Overfitting is an issue where the model fits too closely the data at hand and does not generalize well to new data sets [33]. With overfitting, the models fit not only the relationship between treatment and outcome, but also the individual noise unique to each patient.  Overfitting avoidance measure will be employed, such as splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and the use of k-fold cross-validation approaches.  Overfitting is not an issue for propensity score matching.  The number of potential confounding variables that can be modeled as predictors of an intervention is usually greater than the number of variables that can be modeled as predictors of an outcome, because the number of patients treated is generally much greater than the number who develop the outcome.  Another reason that more confounders can be included is that there is no danger of overfitting the propensity modelinteraction terms, quadratic terms, and indicator variables can be included [17].

FP00025389,327,,,,,1,,,"Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to have a stroke, more susceptible speech loss, and more likely to have severe aphasia. Individuals with low SES struggle to adhere to clinician guidelines because of 1) poor access to quality care - 60% of individuals with low SES report lack of transportation as a barrier to care, 2) increased severity requires high-intensity therapy which is not fully covered by traditional copay models or Medicaid/Medicare which have caps on SLT costs. To reduce post-stroke disparity in low SES groups, we need to invest in development of novel tools that make therapy more accessible. For the past 5 years, the PI has been developing Startle Adjuvant Rehabilitation Therapy (START), a tele-enabled, low-cost treatment to improve therapy outcomes in individuals with stroke  in particular individuals with severe stroke. START is the application of a startling, acoustic stimulus (via headphones) administered in conjunction with traditional therapy. START increases the intensity of muscle activity: more frequent onset, larger amplitude (2-3-fold higher than maximum voluntary capacity), and faster onsets. START is adjuvant, meaning it does not replace clinical practice but instead enhances current evidence-based treatments. Objective: Determine if START can be used to enhance functional and expressive speech. Preliminary data: Individuals with severe-to-moderate stroke-induced aphasia/apraxia completed a remotely delivered, 3-day training with START. Aphasia scores improved (WAB-Q: +4.9%) and error decreased during the increasing word length task (ABA-2;2A: -81%) and articulation inventory measuring reading, spontaneous and automatic speech (ABA-2;6: -32.5%). The diadochokinetic rate also increased (ABA-2;1: +9.5%) leading to subjects to self-report improvements in their functional communication (COAST: +9.6%). These preliminary results indicate that START can be deployed remotely and may prove a valuable, adjuvant tool to generate changes in functional and expressive speech. We propose to perform a Phase 1 clinical trial on a larger cohort of 54 subjects, with a longer, 5-day training with the goals of establishing that START can Aim 1) enhance functional and expressive speech and Aim 2) generate sustainable changes that impact quality of life. Impact: This proposal is significant because it tests a tool that has the potential to directly target the causes leading to SLT disparities for individuals with low SES. A third (34%) of 6.5 million people in the U.S. with stroke are on Medicaid or uninsured. Our best evidence-based therapies (e.g., high-intensity/ high-dose SLT) and our emerging rehabilitation technologies (e.g., TMS) are inaccessible to our low SES populations. START addresses disparity because it 1) targets individuals with severe disability, which disproportionally affects low SES and minority groups, and 2) is tele-enabled eliminating transportation. If successful, this study will set the stage for larger trials to establish 1) the effectiveness of START to be incorporated into traditional SLT and as well as patient compliance, adherence, and tolerance  particularly in low SES groups.

FP00025434,329,,,,,1,,,"Estimating the Prevalence and Probability of Homeless Youth using Linked Administrative Data in Maricopa County, Arizona  The Maricopa County Continuum of Care (CoC) uses three siloed data sources on homeless youth to guide service planning and delivery: the Homeless Management Information System, the Point-in-Time Homeless Count, and administrative data from the Arizona Department of Economic Security on youth receiving public assistance who are homeless. Collectively, these data sources are unlinked, incomplete and duplicative. In response to HUDs call, researchers from four centers at Arizona State University will compile linked administrative and public data from six sectors: health care, housing/homeless services, public assistance, education, criminal justice and child welfare. We will produce estimates of the incidence and prevalence of homeless youth at the city, county and state levels along with health and psychosocial characteristics and histories of youth that are most likely to produce homelessness.  Using these linked administrative and publicly available data, our four research questions include: 1) What opportunities exist for inventive linkages among administrative and other data sources to better understand the characteristics of homeless youth?; 2) What are the incidence and prevalence of homeless youth across six sectors at the city, county, and state levels?; 3)What health, psychosocial and demographic characteristics and histories of youth are most likely to produce homelessness?; and 4) What predictive value do the findings have for each sector? We will disseminate findings through a data dashboard, annual data summits, and both academic and public scholarship. Results from this research project will provide valuable information on the incidence, prevalence, characteristics and histories of homeless youth, which has implications for tailoring policies, programs and services for this population.

Site:  This work will be conducted at Arizona State University in the Phoenix metropolitan area as part of a multi-center study sponsored by Gencor Pacific.  The College of Health Solutions (CHS) and The Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University are committed to translating scientific health research and discovery into practice by bringing together researchers, faculty, students and community partners to work on specific health challenges.Study Description:  The protocol was prepared by Dr. David Briskey, a Research Fellow at the University of Queensland, Australia.  In brief, up to 400 healthy adults (18-65 y) will be recruited from the Arizona State University campus community.  We will target adults at higher risk for COVID-19/respiratory tract infections including healthcare staff, individuals with obesity (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) or type 2 diabetes, people of color, and those = 60 years of age.  Participants will be recruited via online advertisement and social media.  Once enrolled, participants will be randomly allocated to the placebo group (CON, maltodextrin opaque capsule identical in appearance to the test product) or the PEA group (600 mg; presented as 150 mg capsules) and instructed to consume four capsules daily. All participants will receive a journal to record respiratory tract symptoms daily for 16 weeks using the validated WURSS-21 questionnaire.  Participants will be invited to provide a blood sample at the start of the trial (baseline) and at trial week 16 (end of trial).  The target n for blood sampling is at minimum 50 participants from each arm of the trial.  If participants report flu-like symptoms during the 16-week trial, they will be asked to submit to testing for COVID-19 and the seasonal flu (testing conducted by the Arizona State University free of charge for employees and students) and to provide these results to study investigators.  Anthropometrics, health history, diet, and physical activity information are collected at baseline.  The incidence and duration of URTI symptoms are tabulated from journals collected at four-week intervals.  Fasting blood samples at baseline and week 16 will be collected by a trained professional at the CHS research clinic, immediately processed, and frozen for later analyses.  A subset of blood samples will be analyzed for inflammatory markers, metabolite profiles, and immune cell profiles (to be used to compare differences between treatment arms and for computational modeling). Some in vitro analyses will be conducted to examine the mechanistic action of PEA in cell-virus interactions.  Additional study details are outlined in the protocol prepared by Dr. Briskey.    Timeline:  The trial is anticipated to start in Oct 2020.  (The start is contingent on University approval to resume in-person human subject research amid the COVID-19 pandemic.)  Following IRB approval, study recruitment will begin in Nov/Dec with 50 participants enrolled by the end of Dec 2020.  Up to 350  participants will be enrolled by Mar 2021.  The trial is anticipated to be completed by Jun 2021.  The incidence and duration of URTI symptoms will be tabulated and analyzed by Aug 2021.  Blood analyses are expected to be completed by Sep 2021.  Expected results:  Based on previous literature demonstrating the efficacy of PEA for reducing URTI, we anticipate a reduced incidence and duration of URTI symptoms in the test arm compared to placebo.  Additionally, we anticipate that inflammatory markers, metabolite profiles, and immune cell function will portray a more balanced immune reaction in the test arm compared to placebo.",

Although the DPP has been translated to a variety of adult populations and settings, engagement and effectiveness is diminished in minority communities and there are no family-focused diabetes prevention trials for Latinos. For over a decade, our team has collaborated to address the social and cultural determinants of diabetes among Latino youth, in the midst of extant disparities in access to care, low health literacy, and certain cultural norms that may increase diabetes risk. Our culturally-grounded approach is guided by an Ecodevelopmental model that considers community, family, peer, and individual-level factors that influence health behaviors and health outcomes over time. Through a series of increasingly rigorous studies we established that a lifestyle intervention can significantly reduce T2D risk factors and increase Quality of Life (QoL) among Latino adolescents with obesity. We now propose to build upon our extensive experience working with the local Latino community to rigorously test the efficacy of a family-focused  diabetes  prevention  intervention  for  reducing  T2D  risk  and  increasing  QoL  among  high-risk Latino  families.  We  will  use  Integrative  Mixed  Methods  to  understand  how  family  structures  and  processes influence intervention outcomes. We will examine the sustainability of the intervention at 12-months and explore mediators  and  moderators  of  long-term  changes.  Lastly,  we  acknowledge  that  the  current  translational  gap between  scientific  discovery  and  real-world  impact  must  be  closed  so  that  evidence-based  interventions  are expeditiously scaled to advance towards health equity for vulnerable and underserved populations. Therefore, we will use the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework to guide areas for adaptation and integration within key community-based organizations that may be well-positioned to adopt and implement family-focused diabetes prevention programs. Our long-term goal is to build the evidence, network, and  capacity  to  scale  multi-level,  family-focused  diabetes  prevention  programs  across  systems  that  serve vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  communities.  As  the  next  step  towards  this  goal,  we  propose  the  following Primary Aim: Test the efficacy of a 4-month, family-focused diabetes prevention intervention, compared to a family control condition, for improving glucose tolerance and increasing QoL among high-risk Latino families. Secondary Aim: Understand how family structure and family processes influence the reach, diffusion, and impact of the intervention on the family system. Exploratory Aim: Examine mediators and moderators of 12-month  changes  in  glucose  tolerance  and  QoL.  Implementation  Aim:  Create  a  statewide,  stakeholder-informed plan to take family diabetes prevention to scale  by 1)  generating a rapid learning community with organizations that serve Latino families in Arizona, 2) exploring the need, readiness, costs of, and capacity for implementation  across  these  organizations,  and  3)  planning  adaptations  and  activities  to  enhance  fit  and function of the intervention within these organizations.

FP00025495,335,,,,,1,,,"A proteome-wide quantitative study of antibody response in COVID-19 patients with and without cancer  Abstract Cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 suffer higher rate of severe disease and fatality compared with the general population. Impaired immune response is believed to play a major role in COVID-19 severity. We will perform the most comprehensive antibody analysis to date to improve our understanding of the immune response in COVID-19 patients and gain insight in the relationship between patients clinical courses and antibody responses. We will quantitatively characterize responses to all viral proteins, beyond just the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, including immunoglobulin class and isotype, and magnitude and kinetics of response.  Antibody responses will be evaluated in the context of clinical factors such as severity of infection, disease outcome, effects of immunomodulatory treatments, and effects of previous or co-infections. To this end, we will also address how previous infections with other coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens influence patients risk and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study will focus on cancer patients. We will also perform the same comprehensive analysis of three control groups, COVID-19 patients without cancer, cancer patients without COVID-19, and subjects without COVID-19 or cancer. By comparing COVID-19 patients with cancer and control patients, we will have an improved understanding of infection risk in cancer patients and the association between antibody responses and patients clinical manifestations. Our comprehensive antibody analysis is empowered by an innovative assay that integrates immunoassay with next-generation sequencing to assess antibodies against many hundreds of viral antigens in many hundreds of patients in a single assay to produce quantitative data with high dynamic range. Antigens will be individually barcoded with unique DNA sequences and immunoprecipitated by antibodies in patient serum, followed by quantitative assessment of the DNA barcode by NGS to assess antibody concentrations. A unique advantage of our assay is the study of antibodies against hundreds of full-length properly folded viral proteins in solution. We will perform longitudinal studies on antibodies of different classes and isotypes against SARS-CoV-2, other human coronaviruses and important respiratory pathogens.   The proposed study will be led by Dr. LaBaer with team members comprising experts on disease antibody response, immunoassay, next gen sequencing, bioinformatician and biostatistician. The LaBaer lab is one of the leading research groups on antibody response in cancer. In response to COVID-19, Dr. LaBaer has established ASU Biodesign Clinical Testing Lab for SARS-CoV-2 test.  Dr. Sekulic (co-I) is a physician-scientist leading the effort of COVID-19 biobank and research at Mayo Clinic.  We will actively participate in SeroNet activities, collaborate and make available our novel antibody assays to other research groups. We believe our comprehensive longitudinal antibody analysis will contribute to elucidating the pathological mechanism of COVID-19 in cancer patients and devising effective strategies for patient management.  Summary COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is having a devastating impact on our society. An impaired immune response contributes to the development of severe disease and fatal outcome. We propose a comprehensive study of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, all other human coronavirus and important respiratory pathogens to understand role of antibody response in disease risk. Severity and outcome, and, importantly, the increased fatality in cancer patients.  ",

FP00025533,338,,,,,1,,,"To enable a comprehensive analysis of the illicit supply network in the dark web, we have designed a scalable, real-time dark web data monitoring and collection system that continually monitors the dark web content from the underground illicit markets. This infrastructure has three main components: Dark Net Data Monitoring, DNM Content Processing and Analysis, and Blockchain Network Monitoring.To facilitate DNM content collection at a large scale, we propose an automated dark net monitoring component that is equipped with carefully-designed countermeasures for circumventing prohibitive anti-crawling measures adopted by cybercriminal platforms. At the core of this countermeasures stands our novel deep learning-based dark net CAPTCHA breaking system, AZSecure (Arizona Cyber- secure) GAN, which employs Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to solve CAPTCHA patterns without a need for human interference. The proposed system aims to counteract the challenge-response security measure adopted by DNM platforms to identify human users vs. robots. The proposed system is described in the next section as part of our identification and collection strategies.After we extract the relevant DNM data, we will use this data and link with data extracted using Bitcoin transactions. To enable detection of illicit crypto currency transactions, we propose novel and robust automatic illicit transaction detection algorithms on blockchain, based on the systematic integration of machine learning tools with topological data analysis of the cryptocurrency transaction graphs. As a part of this project, we will create a scalable blockchain data analytics software toolbuilt on top of Apache Spark architecture, that will enhance the capabilities of the law enforcement agents. First, our blockchain analytics methods would allow for systematic extraction of local topological blockchain network features associated with potentially illicit trade patterns associated with escrow based transaction and money laundering. Second, using machine learning tools in supervised and unsupervised settings and topological similarity-based analysis, we will develop detection and risk scoring algorithms for malicious blockchain activity. We will validate the accuracy and eciency of the proposed techniques based on the criminal networks that are already disclosed. We will build on our previous work on identifying money laundering transactions. The current project will advance predictive capabilities for combating a broad range of emerging cybercrime activities, from the use of cryptocurrency to supportransomware to money laundering to opioids and human tracking. Although our proposed techniques would be applicable to detecting dierent types of money laundering detection on blockchains, we plan to combine it with extracted DNM information to tailor them for opioid transaction detection.Intellectual MeritTo our knowledge, this is the first proposal that aims to build an end to end framework that can support novel combination of blockchain and DNM data analytics for detection of illicit drug trades by leveraging multiple types of data, ranging from cryptocurrency transactions to dark net market place to opioids usage and trend information. Furthermore, this is the first project that proposes to understand the impact of \local structures observed in blockchain transactions in various illicit trade network detection. Our specific objectives are motivated by the following over-arching questions derived from illicit trade network operations: How can we efficiently and reliably extract such critical insights from DNM data as emerging drug use trends, shifts in drug availability dynamics, and information on virtual proles and behaviors of vendors and sellers? How can we systematically embody the extracted DNMknowledge to facilitate tracking illicit drug trades on blockchains? How can we detect existing and emerging patterns of malicious cryptocurrency activities by analyzing local blockchain graph topology and geometry? How can we design a new integrative threat intelligence methodology for proactive combating of illicit drug trades on cryptomarket? To our knowledge, this is the first project that aims to shed a multi-perspective light on these critical questions by proposing interdisciplinary approaches in blockchain and DNM data analytics at the interface of algebraic topology, particularly, topologicaldata analysis, machine learning, and statistics. Armed with the machinery of the emerging tools of topological data analysis, we will then develop, deploy and validate novel data driven techniques to combat illicit trade activities especially opioid trades on real world blockchain and DNM platforms.",

FP00025536_Rev2,341,,,,,1,,,"Option Year 2 Proposal Arizona State University Biodesign Capacity Building Center (ABCBC) A.1. Executive Summary:In option year 2, ASU Biodesign Capacity Building Center (ABCBC) led by Dr. LaBaer, has maintained 5000 tests/week testing capacity, participated in SeroNet activities, performed clinically important serosurveillance and sero-protection studies during Option Year 1, as outlined in this proposal. We are harmonizing our SARS-CoV-2 multi-antigen (RBD and Nucleocapsid) Multiplex In-Solution Protein Array (MISPA) to WHO standards of Binding Antibody Units (BAU). We are optimizing our multi-antigen MISPA assay. This assay clarifies the history of exposure to multiple pathogens, antibodies to immune modulators (growing topic of interest among serology community) simultaneously in the same patients/sample set.During the option year 1 at ABCBC, along with our subcontractor, Dr. Kleimans laboratory at Columbia University, successfully delivered reference control samples to FNL. With our four clinical partners we now have 786 active participants representing healthy controls, patients with different immunocompromising conditions, and breakthrough infections. More than 2,100 study visits have been completed since the study began. During the visits, participants completed questionnaires and donated specimens for serum, PBMCs, saliva, and nasal swabs. The MISPA assay for SARS-CoV-2 serological test that uses a 3-antigen panel has been optimized to include calibrators for semi-quantitative results (RBD, NC, and control protein GFP). Currently our highly reproducible SARS-CoV-2 serological test can process > 2,000 serum samples in a single NGS run with 98% specificity and 90% sensitivity for the RBD protein (n=155 SARS-CoV-2 positive and n=133 negative). The MISPA assay has been developed to be a Semi-quantitative for SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NC. The assay was validated by running multiple calibrators and ASU-collected samples (n=185) in two independent assays (using an identical batch of barcoded protein libraries).The inter-assay overall percent agreement (OPA) was 100% for whRBD and 91.3% for NC, and the coefficient of variation (CV) was 17.4% for RBD and 17.8% for NC, qualifying our SARS-CoV-2 MISPA assays as a semi-quantitative test.Using a similarstrategy, we selected ten targets to develop semi-quantitative analysis for antigens including spike proteins and NC from HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43, and M1 protein from Influenza A and B.Calibration experimentsand regression analysis are currently underway to quantify the MISPA data for the ten selected antigens and define sero-positive/negative results in internal units of IU/ml. The diluted series for the anti-Halo antibody and multiple serum calibrators showed parallel responses for all ten antigens within the linear range to establish calibration standards. The validation experiments will be completed by the end of Option Year 1.In summary, in option year 1 we successfully delivered 4,495 aliquots of serum and 2,313 aliquots of PBMCs from 52 positive COVID-19 subjects and 279 COVID-19 negative subjects for the reference control project. The technical team has developed calibrators which allow the SARS-CoV-2 related results to be semi-quantitative and have developed a multi-antigen panel with 148 targets using bacterial, viral, and human antigens. A.2. Project BackgroundSince late 2020, COVID-19 vaccines provided an excellent tool to fight COVID-19 pandemic across the world. Current literature suggests primary immunization with two doses of vaccine provided limited protection against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron variant. A booster after a primary course substantially increased protection, but that protection waned over time. Variant-specific boosters are currently being trialed. Our overarching goal is to understand how the health status of vaccine recipients affect the magnitude and titer decay of vaccine-induced antibodies. Given the uncertainty around potential new variants and variant specific vaccines, we are interested in antibody response in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed subjects following primary course of vaccination, with and without boosters using either parental or variant specific vaccine regimen. Immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patient population is heterogeneous. This heterogeneity is further complicated by underlying diseases and co-morbidities. Even among the apparently healthy population, immune competency varies greatly. There is no simple way to assess the health or competency of the immune system. Most published studies assayed only anti-spike or anti-nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2. In this task, we will continue to study antibodies against other coronaviruses, other respiratory viral or bacterial pathogens for the two reasons outlined previously in our option year 1 proposal and recalled below:First, antibodies are produced in response to pathogen infections or vaccinations.  We hypothesize that our antibody repertoire and magnitude can reveal our serological competency. In other words, the antibody signature against common respiratory pathogens and common vaccines that can serve as a surrogate for an individuals serological competency. Instead of relying on disease diagnosis / treatment regimen, we are interested in a molecular determinant of an individuals immune status.Second, previous infection or vaccination may elicit trained immunity, namely immunological memory in innate immune system, which can affect COVID-19 vaccine antibody response and decay kinetics. In addition, antibodies and antibody producing B cells can also modulate the host innate and adaptive immune response. Furthermore, antibodies from previous infection (such as other coronaviruses) may cross-react with COVID-19 vaccination and/or modulate patients response to COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, we are also interested in whether or how previous infections/vaccinations can affect COVID-19 vaccine response.Preliminary studies have had relatively short follow-up time and did not include children. We propose a comprehensive comparative serological analysis of COVID-19 vaccine recipients, with and without competent immune system, adults, or children, to improve our understanding of short term or long-term vaccine efficacy with 3-year post-vaccination follow up. Our proposed study will help address how previous infection with other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses affect vaccine response. We will identify association between a persons immune health signature status as measured by their antibody repertoire with their ability to elicit effective anti-spike antibody response after vaccination. We believe an integrated approach to study a patients serology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, co-morbidities, demographic, and behavior factors will improve our management of vaccine protocol to combat current and future pandemics.B. Scope and ObjectivesB.1. Assay Development At the ABCBC we have developed the Multi-plex in-Solution Protein Array (MISPA) that allows us to use minimal volumes of patient serum or plasma to probe 147 different antigens in one assay with good reproducibility. Samples collected from the ongoing SeroNet Vaccine study have been successfully evaluated with the MISPA assay. We have assayed antibodies to 147 bacterial and viral antigens using MISPA for all samples collected as of 1/31/2022, together with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NC. These are immunodominant antigens previously identified using our planar protein arrays by assaying antibodies against thousands of bacterial and viral antigens in hundreds of subjects of different healthy statuses including diabetes, cancers, lung transplant recipients, and inflammatory bowel disease.  As they were frequently positive in clinical samples, they were ideal to use for the development of a novel multiplexed assay by providing positive signals that could be assessed for quantitative and reproducible responses. Similar to the EUA approved Beckman Access data, anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD was positive for almost all participants after vaccination except for some pediatric cancer patients. The Overall Positive Agreement for anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies was more than 90% between the Beckman Access IgG assay and MISPA. About 10-20% participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 NC, most likely these participants had prior infection before vaccination. Among the 147 antibodies in the first sample collected after the completion of vaccination from all participants, there are common patterns shared by most participants. We also see unique patterns for some individuals.  We also analyzed the correlation of the reactivity of the 147 antibodies in all participants. We observed some tight clusters for antibodies against viruses of related families, such as enteroviruses and human papilloma viruses. Antibodies for some viruses, which were taxonomically very different from HIV, clustered closely with anti-HIV antibodies, which suggests an underlying physiology yet to be evaluated.  Anti-bacterial antibodies seem to have different reactive patterns from anti-viral antibodies. We observed a weak cluster including anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD and common cold coronavirus. We are working to determine the biological meaning of these clusters.B.2. Large Scale Testing B.2.1. In option year 2, ABCBC has maintained serology testing capacity at more than 5000 tests/week using Beckman UniCel DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System at our ASU Biodesign Clinical Testing Laboratory (ABCTL) which is CAP and CLIA certified. All serum samples that have been prepared to submit to FNLCR will be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen using EUA authorized high throughput CLIA, chemiluminescent, Access IgM and Access IgG II tests. ABCBC will monitor seroprevalence, and antibody decay among the general population while maintaining testing capacity to fulfill projected testing demands (See Table 1).The testing performed by ABCBC has been expanded to include a semi-quantitative IgG EUA approved assay. The three Beckman assays in use are: 1) Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG (anti RBD, Qualitative), Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG II (anti-RBD semi-quantitative); and 3) Access SARS-CoV-2 IgM (anti-RBD qualitative).Table 1) ABCTL SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assay Performance Characteristics:Beckman Access SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assay Performance (Source: FDA https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance)Name of the testTargetTechnologySensitivity (PPA)Specificity (NPA)Estimate of Performance95% Confidence IntervalEstimate of Performance95% Confidence IntervalAccess SARS-CoV-2 IgGSpikeHigh Throughput CLIA96.8% (92/95)(91.1%; 98.9%)99.6% (1395/1400)(99.2%; 99.8%)Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG IISpikeSemi-quantitative High Throughput CLIA98.9% (90/91)(94.0%; 99.8%)100% (93/93)(96.0%; 100%)Access SARS-CoV-2 IgMSpikeHigh Throughput CLIA96.7% (146/151)(92.5%; 98.6%)99.9% (1398/1400)(99.5%; 100%)B.3.

Vaccine response in People Living with HIV (PLWH), healthy subjects, pediatric and adolescent cancer patientsWhen comparing PLWH and healthy subjects, antibodies against HIV-1 were present almost exclusively in PLWH, further confirming the specificity of our MISPA assay. Besides, we observed many anti-viral antibodies showing significant reactivity differences between these two groups. Some are higher in PLWH, but many more are higher in healthy subjects.We have assessed RBD IgG and IgM antibodies using Beckman EUA Access SARS-CoV-2 Dxi IgG II assay for all samples we have collected. An arbitrary unit (AU) was suggested by the manufacturer to evaluate the results. The positive cutoff was determined to be 10 times the signal above background. In Figure 1 below, 71% of PLWH, 90% of healthy subjects, and 67% of cancer patients responded to the vaccination regimen. Longitudinal studies have shown the antibody decay rates for the specified patient populations.  We observed that healthy controls had higher response to vaccine than individuals with HIV with faster decrease of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in HIV patients relative to healthy subjects, subjects older than 50 vs those younger than 50, and male participants relative to female participants (See Figure 1).Figure 1) Log10 transformed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response: within 30 days after vaccine completion (upper left); and linear regressions with healthy vs HIV (upper right), age group (lower left), and gender (lower right), where dots indicate either SARS-CoV-2 infections or booster doses.Figure 1) Log10 transformed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response: within 30 days after vaccine completion (upper left); and linear regressions with healthy vs HIV (upper right), age group (lower left), and gender (lower right), where dots indicate either SARS-CoV-2 infections or booster doses.Figure 2) Log10 transformed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response 150 days before and after booster vaccinations.Figure 2) Log10 transformed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response 150 days before and after booster vaccinations.SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers increase after booster administration in most cases, with a great increase in healthy controls compared to those with HIV and in females greater than males (See Figure 2).Serosurveillance studies on the ASU campusOne main goal for the CBC is to maintain the high antibody testing capability. Our CBC maintained serological testing capacity supports multiple clinical studies both inside and outside of ASU. Utilizing readily available CBC testing capacity, ASU performed two serosurveys, 1500 specimens each. In September 2021, the seropositivity rates for RBD and NC on ASU campus were 88% and 20%, respectively. In March 2022, the seropositivity rates for RBD and NC on ASU campus were 96% and 39%, respectively.C.

Maintain High Quality Serological TestingC.1.1.  ASU Biodesign Capacity Building Center (ABCBC) shall maintain capacity for conducting one or more SARS-CoV-2 serology tests using above mentioned EUA authorized tests at ABCTL. In order to maintain a capacity of 5000 SARS-CoV-2 serology tests per week, 1.0 FTE will be used for instrument maintenance, proficiency testing, QA/QC related to instrument calibration, validation of new test(s) when needed, and weekly, monthly maintenance of instruments as per manufacturer specifications. Changes to the assays, SOPs will be reported to FNLCR and SSNCCC.1.2. We will participate in inter-assay and inter-laboratory proficiency testing under the purview of the SSNCC to ensure the validity of the assay. This shall include the testing of blinded evaluation panels provided by the FNLCR Serology Lab and submission of the results to the SSNCC. C.1.3. ABCBC will provide a summary of the number and types of serology tests performed, and analysis of seroprevalence as determined by community testing.C.2. Collaborate with SeroNet PartnersABCBC will collaborate across the SeroNet. Dr. LaBaer, as a voting member of the SSC, will work in partnership with other SeroNet members and participate in efforts of SeroNet. ABCBC team will; a) Participate in regular meetings of the SSC; b) Participate in SeroNet Program activities including but are not limited to Operations Groups, Flash Talks, Trans-CBC Scientific meetings, and the Annual Investigators meeting; c) Share validated SOPs with the SSNCC for dissemination to SeroNet and the larger scientific community; and d) Collaborate with other SeroNet members in SSC-approved research projects such as the pooled data research project.

Sample table.SitesMultiple myelomaHealthcare workersHealthy subjectsPLWHInflammatory bowel diseaseOrgan transplant recipientAutoimmune diseasesMont Sinai XXXXFeinsteinXXUniversity of MinnesotaXXThe ASU CBC has actively worked with other CBCs to acquire samples collected through the SeroNet mechanism or others. We have signed a collaborative research agreement with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We have signed a material transfer agreement with The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research for the SeroNet samples. An MTA with Dr. Anne Davidson at Feinstein for her samples collected outside of the SeroNet has also been executed. University of Minnesota has tentatively agreed to provide an aliquot of biospecimens pending on sample availability after completing planned internal assays. We will profile antibodies in selected samples from other CBCs (See Table 2).Table 2) We are poised to receive substantial number of samples from the other 3 CBC). To include these in our vaccination study will not only increase the statistical power of our study on PLWH and healthy subjects, but also enable us to perform comparative studies on other immunocompromised groups, including multiple myeloma, autoimmune and inflammatory bowel disease patients.We have prepared an application to participate in the integrated data analysis project lead by Jane Figueiredo (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center) and Jacek Skarbinski (Kaiser Permanente). As a part of the study, led by Drs. Chung and Park, ABCBC will share our assay results, questionnaire and clinical data with the group and take the lead to analyze the vaccine response in PLWH. We have been given the lead role in SeroNet data pooling project to analyze the data gathered from HIV participants from Johns Hopkins, University of Minnesota, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Arizona State University. All available data pool will be pooled, including, but not limited to, EMR, clinical, and serological test data, to address research questions related to HIV cohort. Statistical models will be used to infer vaccine efficacy across different source of vaccinations and vaccine boosters. Statistical and machine learning models will be employed to evaluate vaccine efficacy and identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Longitudinal data will be analyzed to investigate how antibody patterns are changed over the time across the different groups and identify potential prognostic risk factors associated with breakthrough infections after COVID-19 vaccine completions or boosters. Vulnerable or underrepresented populations will be included based on EMR or clinical data and examine their vaccine efficacies and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection using the same techniques.  C.3.Serosurveillance and Sero-protective StudiesC.3.1 Summary of collection protocolsEligible participants may be immunocompromised or healthy controls. Individuals of any age may be eligible to enroll. Patients who have recently been diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection via clinical diagnostic test may also be enrolled into the convalescent cohort. Participants may be enrolled around the time they first receive the COVID-19 vaccine or when they receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster. A total of 9 visits are scheduled over a 3-year time period. The 6 visits consisting of a pre-vaccine visit and post-vaccine visits at 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 360 days, 540 days, 720 days, 900 days, and 1080 days. Unscheduled visits are requested if the participants receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster. Unscheduled visits should be conducted before the vaccine booster is administered as well as 30 days and 90 days post vaccine booster. An unscheduled visit should be held 30 days after symptom resolution if the participant becomes infected with COVID-19. Biospecimens including serum, PBMCs, saliva, and nasal swabs will be collected at each visit. Participants are asked to complete health related questionnaires at each visit. C.3.2. Patient enrollment and sample collectionTo date we have 786 active participants which are broken down into categories of People Living with HIV (PLWH), Healthy Controls, Cancer patients, and other immunocompromised individuals. These participants have completed more than 2,100 total visits. Participants complete questionnaires and donate specimens for serum, PBMCs, saliva, and nasal swabs at each visit. In our adult population we have enrolled 155 PLWH, 517 healthy controls, 25 patients with cancer, and 31 immunocompromised participants. Our pediatric population has enrolled 1 PLWH, 20 healthy controls, 27 cancer patients, and 10 immunocompromised individuals (See Table 3).

The total enrollment from each site has been broken down by cohort. While each site has their focus population, no eligible participant is denied enrollment. These participants have completed 2,100 visits and counting.C.3.3. Data and sample submission We plan to send 5ml serum sample and 2x107 PBMC for all study participants to SSNCC every 6-months starting September 2022. However, the collection volumes and numbers vary based on participants ages and health statuses. The disease status and medication regimens of the participants dictate the volumes of serum that can be collected and the number of PBMCs harvested. We will send FNL the full volumes and quantities of PBMCs specified in the SOW aliquots for all participants when possible and available. Cases in which the collected biospecimens do not meet the requirements of the SOW, ASU will make every effort to send FNL aliquots of the specimens collected. Blood collection for the pediatric patients is half of that for adults. There are also volume limitations for children (blood volume is determined by the childs weight) as well as their disease state at the time of collection therefore, the serum volume and PBMC counts are significantly less than that collected from adults. The goal is to send 3 mL of serum and 1x107 PBMC for pediatric patients. We will send aliquots of all our pediatric collection to SSNCC. We will submit questionnaire data associated with each participant. We will submit serological assay data for each sample as requested.    C.3.4.Statistical analysis plan and power analysisWe will continue to collect longitudinal samples at multiple time points and examine how their antibody responses change over time. We want to understand the association of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses from vaccination or infection and the decay of titer over time with variables including 1) subjects' age, gender, co-morbidities, race and ethnicity from the questionnaire; 2) relevant clinical information for specific patient groups if available, such as the CD4 counts for HIV patients or the immune suppressive therapies a subject is taking for autoimmune disease; and 3) antibody repertoire to other coronaviruses, respiratory pathogens and immune modulators.The EUA Beckman Access will be used to run SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assays for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In addition to using the Beckman Access, we have worked extensively on the role of microbial infection in disease through the development of the multi-antigen MISPA assay. Our DNASU center has built a large collection of microbial genes and profiled anti-microbial antibodies in thousands healthy individuals or patients with various diseases. Utilizing the MISPA platform and resources of DNASU we have constructed a panel of immunodominant antigens from a selected set of respiratory pathogens besides the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid. Our proposed serosurveillance study tests the hypothesis that a subject's antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens from vaccination or infection will be influenced by his/her previous infection/vaccination history. The first part of our analysis will focus on antibody growth before and after COVID-19 vaccinations (and additional doses). We will test whether these growths will be statistically significant different among the groups, i.e., immunocompromised subjects or patients on active immunosuppressive therapy from healthy controls, using ANOVA. A post hoc test will be used to determine the source of differences observed between the groups. The second part of our analysis will focus on antibody decay after COVID-19 vaccination. We will use a linear mixed-effects model to investigate effects of group, time, and their interaction on antibody responses. Interaction term will be removed if it will be statistically non-significant. We will then add clinical, demographic, and other coronaviruses and other respiratory pathogen variables to the model and evaluate the improvements. We will also compute correlations between antibody responses and other variables. The same type of analyses will be performed to compare antibody responses over time between children and adults; COVID-19 vaccination and non-vaccination groups; COVID-19 vaccination and booster shot groups. A subgroup analysis will be further performed by clinical or demographical parameters. P-value will be adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, and adjusted p-values less than 5% will be classified as statistically significant. For the antibody growth analysis, if we can recruit 100 samples per group assuming 20% of them will be unvaccinated at the time of enrollments having a moderate effect size of Cohens f2=0.2, our study will achieve at least 74% power at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. For the antibody decay analysis, our study with 100 samples per groups having a regression coefficient of >=1 achieves at least 70% power at an FDR of 5%. We additionally computed statistical powers under various scenarios, where, for example, our study achieves at least 89% powers if we can recruit 150 samples per groups and find antibodies with moderate effect sizes (Table D.5.1).C.3.5. Summary of Enrollment and Projected Enrollment for Option Year 2Breakthrough cases are becoming more prevalent with the mutations of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. We will focus on enrolling these participants to evaluate the differences in the antibody response in individuals with varying levels of antibodies towards the original vaccine antigens.  Working with our subcontractors we have set a goal of enrolling 200 new patients in Option Year 2 (See Table 4). At PCH we plan to expand enrollment efforts to clinics that treat chronically ill patients who are immunocompromised. The new clinic will provide more opportunities to find participants who may be willing to enroll in the study and the frequent visits to the clinic will help with study retention. At Valleywise Health we will be enrolling participants from outside the HIV clinic. Clinics of interest are the post-partum floor to enroll new moms with active COVID infections and the autoimmune clinic. Columbia University has arranged to enroll pediatric participants from their childrens hospital. This enrollment will help us build power in our pediatric cohort. Midwestern University will increase their efforts on enrolling COVID convalescent participants with the current Omicron surge and will continue their work enrolling Healthy Controls. Recruitment and enrollment within the ASU CBC will be focused on the following patient populations:Individuals with HIVIndividuals with autoimmune disordersChildren (majority cancer patients) from PCH and CUHealthy ControlsSitePatientsActive participants through Option Year 1Projected enrollment in option year 2Justification of estimated enrollment goalsValleywise HealthHIV16825Continue to focus on the HIV clinic with new recruitment in the internal medicine clinicMidwestern UniversityHealthy controls25530Recruitment continues in ongoing in the multi-disciplinary clinic.

Vaccine now approved for 6 months - 18 years old. Table 4) Breakdown of the subcontracted sites and the enrollment to date as compared to the enrollment goals in Option Year 2. Justification for the enrollment goals is included.C.3.6. Expected/Planned accrual goals at ASU for Option Year 2Recruitment and enrollment in the next year will depend on the number of individuals that elect to receive a booster vaccine and the amount of breakthrough cases. In Option Year 1 enrollment was more difficult than anticipated and resulted in significantly fewer new participants than expected. The enrollment goals for Option Year 2 are based on the current enrollment trends. We are actively working with different clinics that treat immunocompromised patient populations within the subcontractors healthcare organizations to enroll new participants. In addition to new enrollment we will be submitting a protocol modification to increase participation in the study to 3 years and we ask participants to return for 3 additional scheduled visits (18 months, 30 months, and 36 months). The unscheduled visits that collect data from participants for breakthrough cases of COVID-19 infection and the 3 timepoints around the time they receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster will remain unchanged. Due to the increased mutations and ever changing virulence in SARS-CoV-2 we feel that the increased length of participation will allow us to capture valuable data in real time as new vaccines are approved and the virus mutates. C 4. Technological InnovationC.4.1. Summary of progress for Option Year 1C.4.1.1. Validation of semi-quantitative MISPA assays for SARS-CoV-2 whRBD and NCTo validate the SARS-CoV-2 MISPA assay for whRBD and NC as semi-quantitative assays, in the Option Year 1, we selected and tested internal calibrators of serially diluted monoclonal antibodies against RBD and NC, respectively. Three concentrations (representing low/med/high levels) of each antibody were chosen as the internal calibrators (Fig. C.4.1, left panels), of which the responses against whRBD or NC were aligned with those at 25%, 50%, and 75% percentiles, respectively, of clinical samples collected in early 2020 (natural infection with qPCR+). The threshold for negative response was set with pre-COVID samples collected before 2019. We then performed validation experiments (2 MISPA runs on different days by using an identical batch of barcoded protein library) with the ASU-collected samples (n=185) and measured the within-batch reproducibility by using the sample groupings (high/med/low/negative) predefined by the antibody calibrators. The inter-assay overall percent agreement (OPA) was 100% for whRBD and 91.3% for NC, and the coefficient of variation (CV) was 17.4% for RBD and 17.8% for NC (Fig. C.4.1, right panels), qualifying our SARS-CoV-2 MISPA assays as semi-quantitative tests.C.4.1.2. Calibration of SARS-CoV-2 whRBD and NC MISPA assays to the WHO standard BAU/ml unitTo calibrate the MISPA values to the WHO standard unit (BAU/ml), we employed three sets of internal calibrators: monoclonal anti-Halo antibody (M-a-Halo, recognizing the C-term fused Halo tag in each protein), a serum from an individual (Int Calibrator-1), and a contrived serum (Int Calibrator-2).

FP00025575,343,,,,,1,,,"The COVID-19 pandemic will stand as the biggest challenge to public health in modern history. It is a virus that knows no bounds. And right now, in the US, as the virus spreads unchecked, Americans are suffering.  Given the unparalleled medical, economic, and humanitarian threats brought by COVID-19, it is critical that we work together  sharing information and best practices, coordinating research and development, providing smart and effective actions to advance our knowledge and improve our decisions moving forward.  To help take back control, Arizona State University (ASU) and its College of Health Solutions is launching the ASU COVID-19 Diagnostic Commons, which will complete four interrelated projects to create curated information, disseminate knowledge in broad and deep communities of practice, convene experts to share real world experience, and increase smart testing to help economies open safely and sustainably.Similar to The Rockefeller Foundations mission of accelerating breakthrough solutions, ideas and conversations ...to improve the well-being of people everywhere -- ASU is committed to advancing research and discovery of public value and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves. With this proposal, we ask that The Rockefeller Foundation consider a request for $1,078,772 to support the ASU COVID-19 Diagnostic Commons. The initiative, collectively named the ASU COVID-19 Diagnostics Commons, will: 1.Deploy smart testing use cases and/or testing protocols for clinical decision making. 2.Develop and continuously update COVID-19 Testing Commons, a searchable global test database which provides a host of metrics, including quality data and regulatory status for the 1,400+ tests on the market and in the pipeline. 3.Identify new testing technologies and disseminate timely analysis about promising innovations entitled Testing Technology Trends. 4.Build COVID-19 Workplace Commons  Keeping Workers Well, an innovative, interactive dashboard and back-to-workplace online resource community designed to enable information sharing among employers and policy makers through a worldwide employer survey about back-to-workplace practices and multiple knowledge convenings.    The data, information and knowledge created through these four initiatives will be shared broadly through a public website housed at ASU, as well as numerous online educational webinars for both small and large audiences.  The need for reliable information from respected and recognized sources is clear. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is only six months old, accurate data related to it is fast moving and often not reliable. Based on the ASU National COVID Diagnostics Summit and subsequent meetings with trade and industry associations, we heard the urgent need for the data and resources that will be generated by the COVID-19 Diagnostics Commons. Employers of all types and sizes - from educational institutions, hotels to healthcare insurers - are all asking for help. We will engage with strong strategic partners to increase our ability to execute on these projects quickly and create broad and deep awareness of all of the information and knowledge generated. The collaboration between ASU and the World Economic Forum (WEF) is central to the work of the COVID-19 Diagnostics Commons, namely establishing the COVID-19 Workplace Commons. ASU and WEF each bring a critical mix of competencies required to successfully achieve the Initiatives primary objectives.  Recognized globally as a top-ranked knowledge enterprise focused on solutions to societys greatest challenges, advancing a better life for all, ASU brings deep experience in testing, biomedical diagnostics, data analytics, web platform development as well as a vast network of global contacts across industries. As the largest university in the country, ASU also enjoys a unique vantage from which to convene webinars and global communities of practice. Finally, ASU has extensive operating knowledge and contacts within the current testing ecosystem through its unique Master of Science degree program in Biomedical Diagnostics, the only program in the world focused exclusively on diagnostics as an independent discipline.",
FP00025627,344,,,,,1,,,"1. The Technology Innovation.The efficient use of available medical resources (e.g., ventilators) is a critical challenge during pandemics, such as SARS, MERS, Swine flu and currently COVID-19. There are presently no well-validated prognostic markers of respiratory function for infected individuals exhibiting such influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms that can also be efficiently disseminated on a large scale. It is generally not tenable to completely stop the spread of ILIs, particularly novel ones such as COVID-19. Containment and triage are typical approaches designed to prevent overwhelming available health care resources while herd immunity is achieved as safely as possible in less susceptible individuals and scarce resources are devoted to the most vulnerable. The hope is that treatments become available before too much mortality or morbidity are realized. In this context, there are several questions of interest for individuals that present with ILI symptoms that must be addressable by any proposed optimization strategy for healthcare resource allocation:1.     What is the probability that a patient who contacts a health care provider will need hospitalization?2.     What is the probability that a patient receiving passive oxygen supplementation in an inpatient setting will require a ventilator?3.     What is the probability that a patient requiring mechanical ventilation is going to survive?Aural Analytics has put together an STTR team that aims to meet these challenging goals within the one-year Phase I STTR period of performance. Professors Visar Berisha and Julie Liss from Arizona State University (ASU) have done seminal work on tracking neurological and respiratory outcomes using sophisticated speech analytics. They will be co-Investigators for the Research Institution (RI). Aural Analytics Inc. has developed and deployed a clinical-grade, HIPAA-compliant platform for collecting speech and is the proposing small business.The critical technical innovation proposed here is the development of a panel of acoustic-based measures that index respiratory function and can be collected remotely from a patients personal mobile device without the need for additional hardware. For the purpose of the COVID-19 use case, a mobile application on the patients mobile device will guide the patient through a maximum performance phonation task. The application prompts the patient to take a deep breath of air and say ahhh as long and steadily as possible until running out of air. This allows the extraction of various indices of respiratory capacity that track well with spirometry measures. Analytics calculated from the acoustic signal return a set of well-accepted measures of respiratory-phonatory function in addition to the raw acoustic signal for further processing. With respect to COVID-19, this has the potential for both immediate-term and near-term value. In the immediate term, we can develop a mobile application to provide clinicians with well-validated and well-accepted measures of respiratory function, in order to track patient progress and to triage those with more severe respiratory issues. In the near term, by using the raw acoustic signal and collecting data according to the protocol that will be outlined in a full proposal, we can develop machine learning algorithms that directly predict the probability of requiring hospitalization, passive oxygen supplementation, and ventilation.2. The Technical Objectives and Challenges. (Up to 500 words)To address the ILS questions introduced in Section 1 in the context of COVID-19, Aural Analytics has structured its STTR project around two technical tasks:1. Task 1 (Aural Analytics): Develop a mobile application for collecting accepted measures of respiratory function using a mobile device without needing additional hardware. Outcomes can be used to track patient progress and to prioritize those with more severe respiratory issues.2. Task 2 (ASU): Develop a prognostic digital biomarker of respiratory function. This task will require a new data collection and development of new machine learning algorithms. Once validated, these can be integrated within the mobile application from Task 1.This approach provides focus and a clear delineation of responsibilities. Before proceeding with the more technical details of our project, it is worth briefly reviewing why speech can be an important indicator of respiratory function.Why speech? To produce speech, one must first inhale and then generate a positive pressure within the lungs to create an outward flow of air. This air pressure must be of sufficient strength and duration to power the speech apparatus to produce the desired utterance at the desired loudness. Reduced respiratory capacity, drive or control can manifest as either reduced loudness or rapid decay of loudness during speech. Reduced capacity impacts the ability to hold out speech sounds. These characteristics are often assessed with a maximum phonation time task, where a patient is asked to hold out the ahhhh sound until exhaustion. These sounds can be collected via the built-in microphone in most mobile devices without the need for specialized equipment.In addition to providing a strong justification for using speech to analyze respiratory function, the previous paragraph also makes clear just how closely related our COVID-19 project is to our extensive work on monitoring neurological health. Our existing mobile speech analytics platform, Vocalyze, and its supporting software ecosystem, Integration SDK, combines a front-end mobile application for collecting speech data and a back-end suite of algorithms for processing the data. What needs to be accomplished in this STTR project is COVID-19 specific:Task 1: Mobile Application DevelopmentAural Analytics shall adapt its existing mobile application that was developed and extensively tested for providing a remote assessment of neurological health for assessing a persons COVID-19 status. This COVID-19 application will consist of two or three short speech elicitation tasks. As previously noted, Integration SDK provides the capability for integrating such new functionality in either existing telehealth applications or as stand-alone applications. Audio recorded from these tasks will be sent to Aural Analytics HIPAA-compliant server, where the relevant acoustic measures are extracted and made available to the user if desired.Task 2: Prognostic Respiratory Function Digital Biomarker DevelopmentThe research and development activities associated with this task shall follow a well-established procedure that ASU has used successfully in extracting clinically relevant outcomes for neurological conditions that are characterized by subtle changes in speech: collection of longitudinal speech samples using a mobile application; and development of classification models using machine learning to predict whether an individual is likely to require hospitalization, passive oxygen supplementation, or ventilation.",

FP00025676,346,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary and Purpose  Dr. Pamela Kulinna Increasing Active Transportation to Schools with Phoenix Walks Before Arizona schools began to close in March 2020 due to health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the students, families, and staff at Ironwood Elementary School in Phoenix, AZ, had begun to implement walk to school programs. In early spring 2020, teachers and staff at Ironwood hosted a Walk to School Day event with over 200 students and families. Although the program was interrupted when the school discontinued face-to-face instruction, the teachers and school leaders at Ironwood are eager to resume the walk to school program when students return to school. While walking and biking to school, also called active transportation to school, can be a fun and easy way for kids to get daily physical activity, it may also be a healthy and safe alternative to riding a bus to school during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the health benefits of walking, the Phoenix Walks program may provide school leaders with a logistical benefit as they consider school transportation strategies that align with the CDCs  social distancing guidelines1. Funding from the Arizona Cardinals Charities will be used to support a school coordinator who will work with families to implement and sustain programs that encourage students to walk to school.  Although walking and biking were once common ways to travel to school, those modes of transportation have drastically declined due to parental safety concerns and the convenience of riding by car. In 1969, approximately 41% of students regularly walked or biked to school. By 2001, those rates had dropped to approximately 13% (McDonald, 2007). Several active transportation programs have been developed and used successfully across the world to reverse these trends and overcome barriers related to safety and ease of travel by automobile. Programs such as a Walking School Bus (WSB), where an adult accompanies children along the route to and from school, can help parents mitigate work commute schedules and time constraints (Nikitas et al., 2019). For families who do not live within walking distance of their child's school, neighborhood parks, parking lots, or other public spaces can serve as designated meeting areas where parents can drop their children off or park and walk with them the rest of the way to school. Active transportation initiatives are particularly important in the current COVID-19 era as they can be part of the solution to challenges related to school re-opening2. As schools consider how to accommodate families with a variety of unique options such as staggered schedules and increased distancing on buses, walking remains a flexible, easy to implement, and healthy option for families. To implement and sustain active transportation plans, schools often invest time and effort into scheduling, developing routes, and performing ongoing coordination and communication with families. As these types of transportation plans do not receive funding or resources, it is difficult for most schools to develop, implement, coordinate and sustain these types of programs. During the proposed program, the Phoenix Walks coordinator will work with parents to understand the diverse contexts and transportation needs of families attending Ironwood Elementary School and will organize active transportation initiatives to meet those needs with an emphasis on building relationships with families to sustain programming.  Two faculty members from Arizona State University will provide resources related to active transportation programs with the school coordinator to support the program and provide evidence of program effectiveness. The program team will also develop and distribute an online survey to parents at the beginning, middle, and end of the project. During the survey, parents will be asked to share their concerns, needs, attitudes, and perceptions toward walking as well as their child(ren)s typical mode of travel to school. Information gathered from these surveys will be used to inform the design of the program and provide data to measure how effective the program was at increasing walking to school.                                                        1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FP00025687,347,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary Single-cell  RNA  sequencing  (scRNA-seq)  technology  is  a  powerful  tool  for  quantifying  gene expression profiles in individual cells on a large scale. Analyzing scRNA-seq data, however, is a challenge because of their large volume. In particular, a large number of scRNA-seq data will soon be available in the US, which may include more than a hundred samples with millions or even  billions  of  cells.  Existing  computational  tools  focus  on  the  analysis  of  a  single  or  a  few scRNA-seq data and are not computationally feasible to analyze such large-scale scRNA-seq data.  Therefore,  this  study  aims  to  develop  scalable  and  statistical  methods  with  a  publicly available tool to analyze a large number and volume of scRNA-seq data. First, we will propose a two-stage divide-and-combine algorithm, where in the first stage we visualize and cluster each scRNA-seq dataset separately using uniform manifold approximation and projection (u-map) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-sne) plots. In the second stage, we combine each result  to  obtain  an  overall  u-map  (or  t-sne)  plot.  In  order  to  combine  the  individual  results accurately and efficiently in the second stage, we propose sequential cell-matching algorithms that will combine each of the two results sequentially using a hierarchical clustering algorithm with statistical equivalence testing. Second, we will develop statistical hypothesis procedures based on multiple scRNA-seq samples. Specifically, we will use meta-analysis techniques to compare cell-type  proportions  or  gene  expressions  at  a  specific  cell-type  between  cancer  and  normal scRNA-seq samples. We will then develop an R package to implement these methods.  ",

FP00025701,349,,,,,1,,,"1NAVIGATING AN AUDITORY SCENEOVERVIEW: The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve our understanding of how humans navigate an auditory scene by transforming the acoustic mixture of sounds in their environment into a dynamic, spatial, nearly real-time internal representation of the individual sound sources in that auditory scene. This proposal focuses on the logical starting place for this long-term goal, the size of the auditory scene and what acoustic and non-acoustic parameters help determine that size. As an operational definition of the size of an auditory scene, we mean the number of sound sources that a human listener can count (numerosity), detect (multiple possible sources as targets/signals among many possible maskers/distractors), identify, localize, or discriminate between and among. Using psychoacoustic and modeling efforts, many acoustic and non-acoustic parameters will be investigated to describe listeners processing of an auditory scene, initially its size, in order to: 1) improve an understanding of what acoustic and non-acoustic processes are used in navigating an auditory scene, how those process might operate, and what models might explain the results; and 2) to inform efficient auditory virtual reality processing.INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The auditory scene is the brains estimated solution to a difficult inverse problem, in which the brain must infer what sound sources elicited a highly complex, continuous stream of quickly changing, peripheral neural sensory signals. Using these neural sensory signals and experience, the brain must compute what and where those sources are by creating an internal representation (a perceptual auditory scene) of the outside world, all while the listener and sound sources potentially move. This perceptual auditory scene must be continually updated in order to navigate the auditory environment. Not a lot is known about how the brain accomplishes this complex task. The rapid rise and widespread adoption of auditory virtual reality (AVR) systems in our daily lifes, including education, remote communication, and other augmented reality applications, presents new opportunities to assist education and communication, as well as to improve an understanding of the auditory scene. Successful AVR displays should be able to replicate perceptual auditory scenes. The limited knowledge about auditory scenes restricts the ability to render realistic AVR displays, especially when there are limited computational resources. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to understand how humans navigate an auditory scene by creating a dynamic, spatial, nearly real-time internal representation of the individual sound sources in an auditory scene. This proposal focuses on the logical starting place for this goal, the size of the auditory scene and what acoustic and non-acoustic parameters help determine that size. Small scenes may be easier, less time consuming and less expensive for the brain or an AVR system to process than large scenes, but crucial sources may be missed. Understanding this trade-off is a goal of the research program. Some of the proposed research is based on our past investigations of the size of short auditory scenes, suggesting that the size of the auditory scene is small.BROADER IMPACTS: Technological Impacts: Understanding how the brain maintains (and how AVR technology can efficiently render) an immersive, plausible, and responsive representation of the auditory environment is essential if the benefits (communication, education, emotional) of a wide variety of technologies (not just virtual realities) are to be accessible as possible in as affordable a way as possible. A great deal of effort has been spent developing auditory prosthetic devices (hearing aids, cochlear implants, and assisted listening devices) to improve performance for listeners with hearing loss in processing sounds in complex auditory scenes, yet many challenges remain. The investigators of this application have studied sound-source localization in real acoustic environments by hearing-impaired patients fit with cochlear implants (CIs). Both the development of diagnostic methods to determine difficulties in processing sound in complex acoustic environments and the development of treatments have benefitted and can continue to benefit from many of the outcomes of the past and planned experiments. Knowledge of how the perceived auditory scene is constructed and updated, how technologies might be developed to perform similar tasks, and how different populations accomplish this feat, will be essential to the successful improvement of these communication platforms. Educational Impacts: The proposed research takes place in the College of Health Solutions with students of all types [undergraduates; master-level students; clinical speech, hearing, and language masters and doctoral (AuD) students; and PhD students] and with speech, hearing, and language clinicians and their patients. The Research Internship Program described in the application provides a team of students that support the research effort, and provides a research educational experience for the interns. Interns are recruited from CHS and other programs at Arizona State University designed to engage students in faculty research. The investigators of the application have a long and productive history of disseminating information to the discipline and society.",

Applicant Name: Francesco Acciai  Legal Name of Applicant Organization: Arizona State University Foundation Funding Amount Requested: $49,973 Timeline: August 1, 2020  April 30, 2021 Background and Significance: The recent coronavirus outbreak has severely affected the United States, with over 3.6 million cases and over 140,000 deaths.1 The intensity of this outbreak has greatly varied across different regions. For instance, locations represented in the WIC Health And Nutrition Delivery System (HANDS) Consortium (Arizona, Navajo Nation, and US territories of Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands [CNMI], and American Samoa), a group of five State WIC Agencies, coordinated by the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), have experienced varying rates of COVID-19 outbreak. Arizona and the Navajo Nation have been hit hard by the pandemic, with per 100,000 population rates of 1,900 and 4,900, respectively.1,2,3 On the other hand, Guam, CNMI, and American Samoa have reported few cases of COVID-19.1 The COVID-19 crisis has triggered numerous challenges for the health care, economic, and food systems. Unemployment and food insecurity rates have reached record-high levels, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority populations, increasing reliance on food assistance programs.4,5,6 One of the most noticeable impacts of the pandemic has been the disruption of retail food supply, with limited availability of food staples in stores. This, in turn, is likely to impact redemption of WIC benefits, given that these benefits are limited to specific food items, sold in specific sizes, often have brand restrictions, and can only be redeemed at certified stores for in-person shopping.7 These recent events, including the USDAs waivers offered to states for program implementation flexibility, warrant a closer examination of redemption of WIC benefits, to inform program implementation during disasters, as relief efforts often fall short, especially in underrepresented communities.8,9 Our research, conducted in diverse populations with high rates of poverty, and including locations that are prone to natural disasters, will inform enhancement of the USDAs Guide to coordinating WIC services during disaster10 to ensure vulnerable populations are served during difficult times. Project Goals and Objectives: Our overarching goal is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on redemption of WIC benefits over time among participants enrolled in WIC programs administered by the state agencies that are part of the HANDS Consortium.

FP00025759,354,,,,,1,,,"Major crises, such as the current global COVID-19 pandemic, present some of the largest challenges to societys ability to regulate risks (Hutter and Lloyd-Bostock 2013). However, the situated practices through which workers assess and manage risks has gone largely unexamined until recently, when a body of empirical research on risk work emerged (Gale et al. 2016) and scholars outlined a theory of risk work (Brown and Gale 2018). To date, risk work literature focuses solely on patient/client-facing risk work undertaken by (para)professionals as part of their jobs. However, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the boundaries of occupational work have been stretched. Essential workers exposed to COVID-19 on the job must now do risk work to assess and manage new risks in their everyday lives. For example, an ICU nurse exposed to COVID-19 at work must translate the probability of exposure to her everyday life and the health status of different family members. To minimize assessed risks, she moves into the garage and maintains physical distance from her family, even while worrying about the effects of separation on her young children. Essential workers around the country are beset with such everyday risk work, yet existing literature does not examine the risk work performed by workers to assess and manage such risks. Further, there is a lack of research on how key symbolic boundaries (Lamont and Molnr 2002) such as professional identity and sociopolitical context influence knowledge constructions about risk, shape performances of risk work, and create tensions that must be managed as part of risk work; such an analysis requires comparative research, which is scarce in the risk work literature. The proposed study will fill these gaps by answering two main research questions: 1) What risk work are individuals doing to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19 in patient/client-facing work contexts and in everyday life? 2) How do professional identity, sociopolitical context, and other symbolic boundaries shape COVID-19 related risk work? We will conduct a 2x3 comparative qualitative study of the occupational and everyday risk work carried out by three groups of workers performing different types of risk work across two different sociopolitical contexts. The three groups of workers include two groups with elevated exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 (inpatient healthcare workers and gig drivers) and a control group of individuals who do not have increased exposure from their work activities (outpatient mental health therapists who counsel clients via telemedicine). We will recruit participants in each of these groups in two contrasting sociopolitical contexts: Southern California and Central Arizona. A minimum of 20 workers in each group will be recruited for a total of 120; additional participants will be recruited as needed until saturation is reached. Data collection will consist of a semi-structured interview including both thematic and narrative questions and collection of information sources that participants report influenced their knowledge constructions about COVID-19 risk.",
FP00025759_Res1,355,,,,,1,,,"Collaborative Research: Acting in Uncertain and Contested Terrain: The Risk Work of Individuals During the Long Tail of the COVID-19 PandemicOverview: Major crises, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, present some of the largest challenges to societys ability to regulate risks (Hutter and Lloyd-Bostock 2013). However, the situated practices through which professionals assess and manage risks has gone largely unexamined until recently, when a body of empirical research on risk work emerged (Gale et al. 2016) and scholars outlined a theory of risk work (Brown and Gale 2018). Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the boundaries of professional risk work have been stretched. Professions already tasked with risk work, such as teachers and clinicians, are doing new forms of professional risk work to assess and manage the multiple risks related to COVID-19 (health, psychosocial, educational etc.) to students and patients in their charge. Additionally, these professionals must now do informal risk work focused on handling their own risks from the pandemic (e.g. assessing and managing through various interventions their risk of exposure to COVID-19 and of exposing family members, mental health risks due to increased stress, etc.). This informal risk work is not limited to professionals traditionally tasked with risk work; we have all become risk workers in the ongoing pandemic. Yet, existing risk work literature does not examine these new forms of risk work that are outside the regular scope of professional work. Further, there is a lack of research on how professional and sociopolitical context influence knowledge constructions about risks, shape professional and informal performances of risk work, and create tensions that must be managed as part of risk work; such an analysis requires comparative research, which is scarce in the risk work literature. The proposed study will fill these gaps by answering three main research questions: What professional and informal work are individuals doing to handle COVID-19 related risks, and manage the tensions that arise between risk knowledge, social relations, and interventions both within and between professional and personal contexts? What are the consequences of risk work for individuals? And, how do professional and sociopolitical context shape professional and informal COVID-19 related risk work? We will conduct a 2x3 comparative mixed-methods (interview and survey) study of the professional and informal risk work carried out by three occupational groups across two different sociopolitical contexts. These include two groups tasked with carrying out COVID-related risk work as part of their professional duties within contexts that pose elevated exposure to COVID-19 (frontline healthcare workers and k-12 educators) and a control group of individuals who do not do professional COVID-related risk work but do informal risk work (stay at home caretakers of adult or child dependents). We will recruit participants in each of these groups in two contrasting sociopolitical contexts: Southern California and Central Arizona. Intellectual Merit: The proposed work will extend and reformulate risk work theory and related theories (e.g. intersectional risk theory) using an abductive approach (Tavory and Timmermans 2014) to examine the dynamics of occupational and sociopolitical context in relation to professional and informal risk work and their co-evolution. Our comparative approach will also allow us to uncover how different groups perceive COVID-related risks and to theorize interactions between social context and information sources as they shape risk knowledge and risk work practices. Finally, this work will provide in-depth empirical research on professional and informal risk work practices performed by essential workers during a long-term health crisis and the consequences of risk work for these individuals.  Broader Impact: This work will provide crucial empirical evidence and implications for policy and design to support the risk work of professionals tasked with handling the COVID-related risks of vulnerable populations (children and the ill/infirm), and to support the informal risk work that has been largely invisible. We will disseminate the results of this research through publishing results in high impact social science journals and conference proceedings, as well as communicating key research findings to policymakers, healthcare stakeholders, and educational stakeholders. This research will also inform future policy and governance in response to major crises that require new forms of risk work from workers on the frontlines of crises.",

Ms. Nyarige is currently working on developing several bioinformatics tools that can help understand different disease etiology. For example, she is actively working on a project that focuses on patients with neuro-degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) where she is using genetic data like whole genome sequence, to develop computational methodologies to help understand the mechanisms of these diseases. Her other research focus has been on cancer - specifically brain cancer where she plans to generalize these methodologies to help understand diseases like Glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer), as well as predict patients at risk of developing these diseases. The fact that these projects can be generalized to most disease make translation of her research easy. Her research is very important as it plays a key role in aiding early disease detection and further contributes to more informed treatment plans, moving us a step closer to precision medicine. With the findings from Ms. Nyarige s work, we can quickly identify patients at risk and put them on close monitoring as required. ",

FP00025890,362,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a severe public health crisis worldwide, especially in the US, and especially among seniors over age 65 years. The severity of COVID 19 infection varies greatly, depending on a variety of risk factors including vitamin D deficiency, and that is one of the easiest risk factors to treat. According to the CDC, approximately 34% of seniors have Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Vitamin D supports many important functions in the body, including modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Unfortunately, low levels of vitamin D are common in the US and worldwide, resulting in an altered immunological status, which is associated with susceptibility to autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases, and an increased vulnerability to COVID-19 and other infections. Six studies have found that low levels of vitamin D are strongly associated with increased risk and/or severity of COVID-19 infections. So, the critical question is whether or not vitamin D supplementation at the onset of symptoms can decrease the severity and/or duration of COVID 19 symptoms by boosting innate and adaptive immunity. A pilot study involved testing vitamin D levels in 40 adults with COVID-19, giving them supplemental vitamin D3 if their levels were low, and following them for up to 6 weeks to evaluate symptom severity and duration. It found that vitamin D levels did negatively correlate with severity, and the pilot study demonstrated that daily supplementation was able to safely and rapidly normalize vitamin D levels.  This proposal involves a trial of vitamin D3 supplementation for seniors with COVID-19 infections and low levels of vitamin D. This will be a randomized, double-blind, controlled study of vitamin D3, comparing a high dose against a very low dose. The project will enroll 200 seniors who are at the earliest stages of COVID-19 infection and follow them for up to 3 months or until their symptoms resolve, whichever occurs first.   Aim 1 will focus on determining the effect of vitamin D3 therapy on severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms. Aim 2 will focus on determining the mechanism by which vitamin D acts, including measurements of vitamin D, complete blood cell count with differential, C-Reactive Protein, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and extensive metabolomics.   Expected Outcomes:  Vitamin D supplementation may reduce the severity and/or duration of COVID-19 infections in seniors with vitamin D deficiency. Impact: If this study finds that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for seniors with low vitamin D, then it could be easily, safely, and rapidly implemented nationally and worldwide as a supplemental therapy.  Due to the extremely low cost of this therapy, even a modest benefit would have a high benefit: cost ratio. ",

The Procedures are subject to change, however, as our understanding of COVID-19 continues to grow and  recommendations  change,  and  it  will  be  updated  throughout  your  period  of  certification. Further, as the extent of the community spread varies and new treatments become available, these Procedures will tighten or relax.  These Procedures were designed to comply  with the White Houses Proposed Phase Approach, which establishes a three-tiered re-opening plan. The Proposed Phase Approach recommends that organizations develop and implement a plan considering the following criteria:      Social distancing and protective equipment;   Temperature checks;   Testing, isolating, and contact tracing;   Sanitation;   Use and disinfection of common and high-traffic areas;    Use and disinfection of common and shared equipment as possible; and,  Issues relating to travel.   More specifically, in the first phase, organizations are recommended to:    Encourage teleworking if possible;   Return employees in phases, if at all possible;   Close common areas where employees may congregate, and where impossible, make sure they adhere to strict social distancing recommendations;   Minimize non-essential travel if at all possible;    Facilitate stay-at-home measures for sick employees; and   Strongly recommend special accommodations for vulnerable populations.

Employee Policies A.  Training This Section will describe procedures that are broadly applicable to Program employees. All  Program  employees  who  interact  in  person  with  either  the  public  or  other  Program employees should be trained on every Procedure that affects them. Health  Safety  Managers  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  Procedures  are implemented consistently across the Programs operations. B.  Health Safety Manager The Program shall designate one or more of its Personnel as its Health Safety Manager(s). The Health Safety Manager(s) shall be responsible for ensuring that these Procedures are implemented in a consistent and effective manner. C.  Reducing Employee Exposure Risk Program  employees  fall  into  different  categories  of  risk  under  OSHA  classifications. Individuals who interact directly with the public have a Medium Exposure Risk to COVID-19. OSHAs recommendation for Medium Exposure Risk jobs is that employers should provide employees with general guidance and common-sense methods to reduce exposure and monitor recommendations by the CDC for updates. For engineering controls, consider installing  physical  barriers,  such  as  clear  plastic  sneeze  guards,  where  feasible.  For administrative controls, consider offering to illall employees and customers must wear face masks  or  reusable  face  shields  that  can  be  decontaminated  and  maintain  proper  social distancing when at all possible. Where appropriate, limit customer and public access to worksites or restrict access to certain areas. Consider minimizing face-to-face contact, and communicate the availability of health resources. Meanwhile, employees who work in the office and do not come into direct contact with members of the public have a Low Exposure Risk.  D.  Employee Health Checks All employees will be subject to health checks before visiting a Program office, entering a Program  vehicle,  or  stepping  foot  on  a  customers  property.  There  are  several  different components of these health checks. 1.  Daily Symptom Screening Questionnaire Employees must complete a daily symptom screening questionnaire each day before visiting a Program office, entering a Program vehicle, or stepping foot on a customers  1 7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com property. The questionnaire should include the following questions: a.  Have you been in close contact1 with a person known to have COVID-19 since your last questionnaire? last temperature check.) b.  Have you had a fever in the last 24 hours? (State the date, time, and result of your c.  Do you have any new cough, shortness of breath, chills, sore throat, muscle pain, or new loss of taste or smell? This  questionnaire  should  be  completed  daily  and  submitted  to  a  Health  Safety Manager via email or text message before the employee begins her or his workday. Any  employee  who  answer  a  question  in  the  affirmative  (with  active  COVID-19 symptoms) may not engage in any work-related activities that day. They may return to work  after  (a)  they  have  no  fever  for  2472  hours  without  the  use  of  fever-reducing medicine,  and  (b)  10  days  have  passed  since  their  symptoms  appeared,  and  (c)  any respiratory  symptoms  have  improved.  Alternatively,  the Program  may  use  the  test-based  strategy  described  by  the  CDC,2  which  allows  employees  to  return  to  work when they have (a) no fever, (b) their respiratory symptoms have improved, and (c) they receive two negative test results in a row that were taken at least 24 hours apart. 2.  Employee Proximity to Symptomatic/Diagnosed Individuals The  Program  shall  advise  employees  that  if  they,  or  anyone  in  their  household  is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or if they have been in proximity with any person diagnosed with COVID-19, that they must stay home for 14 days or until it is verified that such individual has not contracted the disease. If they have contracted COVID-19 or  develop  any  symptoms,  they  will  be  allowed  to  return  to  work  pursuant  to  the requirements outlined in Section (I)(D)(1).  E.  Action Plan for Confirmed Case This Section will describe how the Program should respond to a confirmed illness, whether it is related to COVID-19 or not.                                                 1  For  the  purposes  of  this  question,  close  contact  shall  be  defined  on  the  questionnaire  pursuant  to  the  CDCs definition and in plain, easy to understand language (updated May 12, 2020). The CDC defines close contact as (a) being within approximately 6 feet of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of timeincluding caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a COVID-19 patientor (b) having direct contact with  infectious  secretions  of  a  COVID-19  case  (e.g.,  being  coughed  on).  See  FN  2,  COVID-19  FAQ,  Centers  for Disease https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Ffaq.html Prevention, available Control and at 2 See Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings: Interim Guidance, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html (last updated May 29, 2020).  7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  2 Commented [KW1]: Per the CDC site below, this has just changed to 24 hours. Commented [KW2]: I would consider removing or not as this document only pertains to COVID-19 and other illness may or may not be infectious. 1.  COVID-19 If  any  employee  contracts  a  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19,  and  they  have  visited  a Program office or conducted a home visit, the Program will identify all individuals who were in close contact with the infected employee. If a customer informs the Program that  the  customer  may  have  had  COVID-19  during  a  home  visit,  the  Program  will identify  the  employee  who  visited  the  customers  home.  Then,  it  will  facilitate  the testing of all employees who came into close contact with the infected individual, using the COVID-19 RT-PCR Test. While the close contacts await the results of testing, they may not enter a Program office or conduct home visits and should quarantine as per the CDC recommendations.. Employees  who  test  negative  may  return  to  work  immediately.  Any  employee  who tests  positive  shall  follow  the  protocol  of  self-quarantine  isolate  and  return  to  work outlined in Section (I)(D)(1). If, for any reason, a close contact cannot be tested, they must remain in quarantine at home  for  14  days  (from  time  of  last  close  contact  exposure)  while  monitoring  the potential  development  of  symptoms.  They  can  return  to  work  after  the  14-day quarantine period if no symptoms develop. If symptoms develop, they shall follow the return-to-work timeframe identified in Section (I)(D)(1). Additionally, the Program should identify any vehicles or equipment that the infected individual used, in addition to any office space they occupied. Wherever possible, the Program should close off those areas and discontinue use of such vehicle or equipment for 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting them. 2.  Illnesses Other Than COVID-19 Employees who exhibit symptoms or signs of infectious illness that do not indicate a COVID-19 infection should still stay home until their symptoms have resolved. F.  Meeting Protocols This Section will describe how the Program will conduct meetings. 1.  The Program should avoid in-person meetings where possible and use virtual platforms instead. 2.  Where  in-person  meetings  are  unavoidable,  the  Program  shall  ensure  that  physical distancing  measures  are  taken  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.  Therefore,  employees must maintain 6 feet of distance from one another, and the number of in-person meeting participants should be limited to 10 or less people during the initial phase of reopening.  All participants should be required to wear face coverings, and the meetings should be held in the largest space practical under the circumstances. 3.  At meetings, the Program should prohibit common or shared sources of food such as  7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  3 buffet, potlucks, shared water fountains, etc.  G.  Protective Attire 1.  Face Coverings This Section will describe the protective attire that Program employees must wear. Employees must wear masks/face covers whenever they are inside a customers home or in the Programs office, unless they have their own room in the office building and other individuals are not present. These maskswhich are not to be confused with the PPE  masks  used  as  part  of  the  cleaning  protocols  described  in  Section  (I)(G)(3) belowshall be disposable or made of cloth. If made of cloth, the mask must conform to the CDCs guidance on homemade face coverings.3 2.  Gloves Employees are not required to wear gloves unless a specific procedure states otherwise, such as where they are at a customers home. The Program shall provide gloves to any employee who must wear them. Where employees are required to wear gloves, they shall disinfect the gloves every 30 minutes  using  a  hand  sanitizer  that  consists  of  at  least  60%  alcohol.    Additionally, whenever employees remove their gloves, they shall promptly clean and/or disinfect their hands in accordance with Section (I)(I) below. 3.  Protective Wear for Disinfecting Surfaces Employees engaged in cleaning and disinfecting surfaces must wear protective attire appropriate for the material being cleaned, which may include gowns, goggles, gloves, or additional attire. This protective clothing is separate and not to be confused with the standard-use masks described in Section (I)(G)(1) above. In some instances, this attire may be limited to that specified by the cleaning products Safety Data Sheet. For other materials,  additional  Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE)  may  be  required, including but not limited to disposable gloves, surgical masks, gowns, and goggles, in order to limit the risk of exposure to airborne pathogens. Supplemental guidance to the Program on material-specific cleaning attire will be provided at the Programs request. H.  Physical Distancing Whenever possible, employees must remain six feet away from each other and the general public. I.  Hand Cleaning and Disinfection                                                 3  The  CDCs instructions  for https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/DIY-cloth-face-covering-instructions.pdf. the  construction  and  use  of  cloth  face  coverings  are  available  at  7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  4 Whenever these Procedures call for an employee to clean and/or disinfect their hands, the following procedure applies. 1.  Soap & Water 2.  Hand Sanitizer Whenever a sink and soap are available, the employee should clean and disinfect their hands with soap and water. They should first wet their hands with water, and then apply soap, scrubbing vigorously for at least 20 seconds. The employee shall ensure that they scrub all areas of their hands and wrists, including under any jewelry. If soap and water are not available, and an employees hands are not visibly soiled, the employee  may simply disinfect their hands using a hand sanitizer that consists of at least 60% alcohol. To do so, they should cover their hands in hand sanitizer and rub them together until their hands feel dry. This should take approximately 20 seconds. J.  Cleaning & Disinfecting Surfaces This Section will describe how the Program should clean and disinfect its office, as well as any other surfaces that these Procedures require to be cleaned and disinfected:  1.  High-Touch Surfaces High-touch surfaces include (but are not limited to) tables, door handles, light switches, countertops,  steering  wheels,  seatbelts,  dashboards,  gear  shifters,  handles,  desks, toilets,  faucets,  sinks,  repair  tools,  certain  electronics,  and  shared  phones.  These surfaces must first be cleaned with soap and water if visibly dirty, and then disinfected with a household disinfectant as feasible. High  touch  surfaces  that  are  electronics  and  not  suitable for  cleaning  with  soap  and water, are addressed in Section (I)(J)(3) below. The  disinfectant  used  for  non-electronic  high-touch  surfaces  must  be  one  of  the following:   An EPA-registered or HealthyVerify-approved household disinfectant.4   A diluted household bleach solution mix with 5 Tablespoons (1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water.                                                 4  Products  that  are  EPA  List  N  disinfectants  shall  be  used.  Current  List  N  disinfectants  may  be  found  here: https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2.  Disinfectants  that  are  not included on List N must carry a label that features an EPA registration number and lists human coronavirus as a target pathogen.  If  the  product  does  not,  a  bleach  solution  or  alcohol  solution  shall  be  used  instead.  In  the  event  such  a product is unavailable, Furnishing Dignity will have HealthyVerify review the ingredients of any product not included on List N prior to its use. Only products approved by HealthyVerify shall be used.   7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  5   An alcohol solution consisting of at least 70% alcohol.  When  using  either  of  the  bleach-  or  alcohol-based  solutions  described  above,  the solution  must  be  left  on  surface  for  at  least  1  minute  prior  to  wiping  clean.  The employee  cleaning  the  surface  must  wear  gloves  and  ensure  good  ventilation  while disinfecting. For EPA-registered household disinfectants, the employee must follow the instructions identified on EPA List N and in the products literature or on its label. 2.  Soft Surfaces Soft  surfaces  include  any  carpeted  floor,  furniture,  rugs,  and  potentially  seats  in vehicles. Soft surfaces must be cleaned as often as OSHA guidelines normally require. Soft  surfaces  shall  be  treated,  as  appropriate,  according  to  one  of  the  following procedures:   Cleaned using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for these surfaces.   Laundered  according  to  the  manufacturers  instructions.  The  warmest appropriate water setting shall be used, and items will be dried completely.   Disinfected with an EPA-registered List N household disinfectant.  3.  Electronics Electronics include touch screens, keyboards, and tablets. Electronics shall be cleaned after each user is finished using the device and sharing of devices shall be discouraged whenever  possible.  If  possible,  wipeable  covers  will  be  placed  on  electronics. Electronics will be cleaned as follows:   By following the manufacturers instructions for cleaning, OR II.  Office Procedures A.  Face Coverings B.  Hand Sanitizer This Section will describe how the Program should conduct operations in its office. All employees must wear a face covering, as described in Section (I)(G)(1), unless they are alone in a room and have no reason to expect that anyone else will enter it. The Program shall ensure that one bottle of hand sanitizer is located near the door(s) to its officeso  that  individuals  can  disinfect  their  hands  immediately  upon  entering  the  7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  6  If  unavailable,  with  alcohol-based  wipes  or  sprays  containing  at  least  70% alcohol. Surface will then be dried thoroughly.  Commented [KW3]: 60% alcohol is used above; I would keep consistent. 60% ethanol alcohol or 70% isopropanol officeas  well  as  next  to  any  shared  office  equipment,  such  as  printers,  scanners,  fax machines, water cooler, or telephones. C.  Cleaning & Disinfecting High-Touch Surfaces An employee shall clean all door handles that have been in use once every 2 hours, as well as  all  High-Touch  Surfaces  in  the  office  restrooms.  Additionally,  all  shared  office equipment and supplies shall be disinfected after each use, by the employee who used it. D.  Minimize Shared Supplies The Program should seek to limit the extent to which employees use shared supplies, such as writing instruments. To the greatest extent possible, the Program should provide each office employee with their own individual supplies. E.  Restrooms & Drinking Fountains Any drinking fountains should be blocked off for the time being. The Program should also block off every other sink and urinal in its restrooms to facilitate the physical distancing of its office employees. III.  Vehicle Safety A.  Assigned Seating In case Program employees share vehicles when making home visits, the following procedures apply. Where  possible,  only  one  individual  should  drive  each  vehicle  during  a  day,  and  all employees should only use one seat during the day.5 No one else should touch the handle on the inside or outside of their door. Where a vehicle has 2 rows of seating and only 2 individuals in it, 1 employee should drive, and the other should sit in the back. B.  Facemasks C.  Cleaning & Disinfection In  keeping  with  Section  (I)(G)  above,  all  employees  should  wear  face  coverings  while inside a vehicle when more than one employee is in the vehicle. After an employee, or group of employees, finishes using a vehicle for the day, its door handles, dashboard, steering wheel, gear shifter, other controls, seats, seatbelts, and doors (inside and outside) should be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with Section  (I)(J) above.                                                 5 If impossible, each individual should don a fresh pair of gloves immediately before entering the vehicle and refrain from putting the gloves anywhere near their face.  7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  7 D.  Designated Tailgate/Hatch Operator Only one individual should touch a shared vehicles tailgate/hatch during each day. E.  COVID-Kit IV.  Home Visits Each vehicle used to conduct home visits shall contain a COVID-Kit. The kit must include protective gloves and spare face coverings, in addition to hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and other cleaning supplies. This  Section  will  describe  the  procedures that  apply  when  an  employee  visits  a customers home. A.  Customer Self-Screening The  Program  should  contact  all  customers  before  an  employee  visits  their  home  to determine  if  the  customer  or  anyone  else  living  in  his  or  her  house  has  recently  shown symptoms  of  COVID-19  or  come  in  close  contact  with  an  individual  known  to  have COVID-19.  If  the  customer  or  anyone  else  in  his  or  her  home  has,  the  visit  should  be rescheduled in a manner consistent with the return-to-work guidelines set forth in Section (I)(D). B.  Keeping Customers Informed The Program shall ensure that customers understand what is expecteding of them during a home visit. Therefore, the Program should send customers a message prior to each home visit  explaining  that  the  customers  must  wear  a  face  covering  and  maintain  six  feet  of distance from Program employees.  This  Section  will  describe  the  protective  attire  that  employees  must  wear  during  home visits. In keeping with Section (I)(G), all employees shall wear face coverings when they are on a customers property. To minimize the risk that an individual without a face covering comes within six feet  of  a  Program  employee,  the  Program  may  want  to  consider  offering  face coverings to individuals who may be present while its employees are conducting a home visit.  7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  8 C.  Protective Attire 1.  Face Coverings a.  Personnel b.  Customers 2.  Gloves Employees shall don a fresh pair of gloves as they reach the doorstep of a customers home. The gloves must be frequently sanitized in accordance with Section (I)(G)(2).  Despite wearing gloves, employees shall avoid touching any surface in a customers home unless it is necessary for the employee to do her or his job. D.  Physical Distancing Employees must make every effort to stay six feet away from others, especially members of the public who are not wearing face coverings. E.  Declining Shared Food and Drinks Employees shall not accept food and drinks from customers. Instead, they shall bring their own drinks to each home visit and disinfect the bottle before entering. F.  Cleaning and Disinfecting Tools Employees should never place tools directly on the ground at a customers home or on a customers table, chair, etc. Instead, employees should lay a clean cloth on the surface and place the tools on the cloth. After the visit concludes, the cloth should be placed in a bag, and the bag should be isolated until the Program can clean and disinfect it, along with all of the cloths inside the bag. Before an employee puts a tool back in a toolbox, she or he shall clean and disinfect the tool. Commented [KW4]: I would add that members in the home should also be wearing face coverings.  7144 E Stetson Drive, Suite 300, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 | 480.291.0736 | healthyverify.com  9 ",

This medium allows for ongoing technical assistance for primary care providers and clinicians working in rural and underserved areas to increase their capacity to manage complex patients in their community, without necessitating the need to leave ones clinical setting to participate. This joint effort will be available at no-cost to any provider who wishes to participate and free CME credit will be available to those who are eligible. During year 3 of the program, concentrated efforts will be made to establish Palliative Care Centers of Excellence (COE) across the state of Arizona. These COEs will be purposefully recruited clinics or providers from across Arizona who work in rural and underserved areas where there is a clinical shortage of palliative care providers or services. Additionally, dissemination of program outcomes will be made through publication in a peer reviewed journal and through presentation at a national conference.",

FP00026063,371,,,,,1,,,"Most cochlear implant (CI) users can successfully recognize speech in quiet environments. However, they often complain about the difficulties they have for recognizing speech in noisy environments, identifying the affective and linguistic prosodies, and listening to music, which severely degrade their quality of life. Central to these challenges is the perception of pitch cues, which contribute to the segregation and tracking of competing sound sources, and indicate vocal emotions, speech intonations, lexical tones, and musical melodies. Current CIs encode pitch by varying the stimulation place across physical electrodes (i.e., place coding) and by varying the amplitude modulation (AM) frequency of electrical pulse trains on individual electrodes (i.e., temporal coding). However, CI users have poor pitch perception because spectral and temporal fine structures are not preserved with CIs and the electrode array does not reach the apical region of cochlea tuned to the voice pitch range. As a non-surgical approach to extending the lower limit of place pitch perception with CIs, phantom electrode (PE) returns a proportion of the current from the most apical electrode to the adjacent basal electrode. PE was originally designed to stimulate a fixed location beyond the apical end of the electrode array with only temporal pitch coding. Our pilot study showed that CI users were able to identify the pitch contours encoded by varying the proportion of basal return current to stimulate different locations of PE. This novel approach holds great promise in providing CI users with dynamic spectral details in the voice pitch range. However, it is unclear how place and temporal cues on PE may interact with each other for relative pitch perception with either single-channel PE stimulation or a multi-channel speech processing strategy. The long-term goal of our research is to better understand the mechanisms of pitch perception in electric hearing and use the knowledge to enhance pitch perception of CI users. This proposal has two specific aims. The first aim is to investigate the integration of place and temporal pitch cues of single-channel PE stimulation for pitch contour identification by systematically varying the proportion of basal return current and AM frequency. The second aim is to evaluate the performance of an experimental multi-channel CI speech processing strategy with both place and temporal pitch coding on PE, as compared to that of another experimental strategy with only temporal pitch coding on PE and that of the clinical strategy without PE. Our general hypothesis is that congruent place and temporal cues on PE may improve CI performance in pitch-related listening tasks than temporal cues alone. The results of the proposed research will provide great insight into pitch perception elicited by electrical stimulation of the apical region of cochlea, which has not been fully understood in the literature. The proposed research is also of great clinical value, because the results will guide the development of processing strategies to improve CI users performance in pitch-related listening tasks and in turn, increase their quality of life.",

FP00026084,373,,,,,1,,,"Many occupations put workers at risk for burnout, a syndrome resulting from chronic work-related stress, with symptoms characterized by physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion, indifference toward ones job, and diminished job performance. Individuals working in correctional systems are at greater risk for work-related stress than workers in other industries. Risk factors include high workload, constant overtime, diffuse job roles and responsibilities, lack of control in the workplace, and monotonous tasks. Serious cases of work-related stress can lead to medical conditions like adjustment disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some evidence suggests that correctional officers have rates of PTSD roughly equivalent to war veterans. Work-related stress is associated with poorer physical health, substance misuse, insomnia, and missed work. A recent survey by the National Institute of Corrections found that staff recruitment, development, coaching, retention, and health and wellness were rated as highly important by participating agencies. However, it is not clear what evidence-based programs and practices are available to agencies to identify, prevent, and reduce stress and trauma experienced by correctional staff. Without access to effective interventions for alleviating occupational stress, correctional agencies are at risk for poorer employee health, reduced job performance, and higher employee turnover. The purpose of this project is to identify and organize effective interventions for staff and organizational stress and trauma in prisons and jail settings. The success of this project will accelerate the dissemination of evidence-based wellness programs in correctional systems across the country.",
FP00026107,374,,,,,1,,,"People with Parkinsons disease (PD) are increasingly using cannabis from medical dispensaries to treat pain, sleep, and mood problems. Yet, the popularity of medical dispensary cannabis use has outpaced scientific understanding of its therapeutic benefits and harms. Cannabis from medical dispensaries differs from cannabis used in clinical trials in terms of route of administration and higher and more variable THC content. The proposed pilot will address fundamental gaps in knowledge about the acute effects of dispensary cannabis edibles in people with PD. Edibles are of special interest because they avoid the health concerns associated with smoking or vaping and because they appeal to PD patients. We will recruit 60 people with PD who use cannabis edibles for PD-related pain by leveraging the investigators established PD and medical cannabis networks in the Phoenix metropolitan area (population 5 million). This projects innovative approach involves visiting participants in their homes and collecting data before and after participants customary ingestion of cannabis edibles. The before and after assessments will collect information about pain, sleep, mood, and other aspects of functioning that might be adversely affected by cannabis (e.g., objective cognitive test performance), as well as blood cannabinoid levels and cannabis cannabinoid content. Participants will also complete repeated bursts of Daily Diary (DD) assessments about their cannabis use, pain, sleep, mood, cognitive functioning (and other aspects of functioning that might be adversely affected by cannabis), and, concomitantly, wear actigraph devices to assess sleep quality. Aims are to: (1) Characterize the acute effects of cannabis edibles on pain, sleep, mood, and adverse side effects; (2) Test associations between cannabis effects and blood cannabinoid concentrations, and (3) Characterize patterns of cannabis use, reasons for use, and appraisals of cannabis effects in daily life. Findings will inform patients decisions to use cannabis and dosing guidelines.   ",
FP00026108,375,,,,,1,,,"Arizona State University Scope of Work LGBTQ+ Youth in Arizona: An Intersectional Approach to Community Prevention of Substance Use Disorders     The Center for Applied Behavioral Health Policy (CABHP) at Arizona State University (ASU), in collaboration with multiple community partners, takes the lead in this proposal to the William T. Grant Foundation aimed at reducing inequality. We propose a culturally attuned prevention frameworkdrawing on youth participatory action research methodsto decrease behavioral health disparities (i.e., alcohol and drug use outcomes) and increase equal opportunity among Arizona LGBTQ+1  adolescent youth and emerging adults (ages 13-25) to live healthy lives. Aligned with the Foundations mission to improve the lives of young people, our activist strategy  leverages two efforts to reduce inequality: (1) a youth change team and (2) a statewide youth-led and youth-focused conference. Our state-wide prevention effort will lead to more equal opportunities for healthy living, which is critically necessary because LGBTQ+ youth who experience compound oppression based on their race, gender, gender expression, sex, sexuality, ability, and class (see Crenshaw, 1989) are at increased risk of substance use disorder (Mallory et al., 2018). With this proposed effort, we center youth of color. Background Arizonas legal landscape and social climate perpetuate stigma, discrimination, and violence against individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and/or questioning (LGBTQ+) (Mallory et al., 2018). LGBTQ+ Arizonans lack state-level protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, whether in terms of employment, housing, or public accommodations. Of even more concern, anti-LGBTQ+ policies and practices can be found at every level of governance. Indeed, Arizona sits at the low end of LGBTQ+-related equality assessments (Human Rights Campaign, 2019; Movement Advancement Project, 2019). Not surprisingly, multiple forms of anti-LGBTQ+ systemic oppression across the state cause disparate social, economic, and health outcomes for these individuals and those negative outcomes substantially impact the states economy by tens of millions of dollars each year (Mallory et al., 2018).  Systemic oppression leads to health disparities and disproportionate risk of substance use disorders among LGBTQ+ youth as compared to their cisgender and heterosexual peers (Fish et al., 2017; Hatzenbueher, Wieringa, & Keyes, 2011). This is even more pronounced for LGBTQ+ youth of color, who suffer from systemic racism. Nevertheless, Arizona has no statewide efforts to prevent alcohol and drug misuse among LGBTQ+ youth (Governors Goal Council on Healthy People, Places & Resources, 2018). LGBTQ+ youth living in Maricopa County, Arizonas largest and most populous county (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018), have some access to behavioral health promotion resources and prevention programming. One example is the SafeOut program (partners on the current proposal) which aims to prevent substance use and suicide. However, the other 14 counties in Arizona, which are primarily rural, offer limited to no 1 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning. The + indicates youth who do not fall in predetermined categories and who may not identify as cisgender (e.g., agender, nonbinary, genderqueer) or heterosexual (e.g., asexual, pansexual).  programming for LGBTQ+ youth, who are most vulnerable to substance use and/or misuse. Arizona has a critical need for statewide substance misuse prevention efforts that target LGBTQ+ youth. Moreover, youth of color with intersecting identities live in conditions that make them especially vulnerable to substance misuse (e.g., lack of familial acceptance, resources, and access to services) (Conron & Wilson, 2019; Mereish, Sheskier, Hawthorne, & Goldbach, 2019). In Arizona, youth who identify as LGBTQ+ are at critical risk of substance use disorders (Manning et al., 2012); thus, there is a need for enhanced infrastructure to increase state and organizational capacity to implement, sustain, and improve effective substance abuse prevention and health promotion services.   Addressing needs in AZ, we pose the following five project aims and research questions:  1.  Conduct a secondary analysis utilizing data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System and the Arizona Youth Survey. a.  Research question: What is the prevalence of substance misuse among youth in AZ and how does data compare to project needs assessment data (i.e., 2nd aim)?  2.  Lead a statewide needs assessment with primary data collected from LGBTQ+ individuals who are ages 18-25.  a.  Research question: What are the disparate conditions that lead to substance misuse?  b.  Research question: How is substance use linked to structural oppression and related psychosocial stressors? 3.  Convene and facilitate a youth change team with representation from across Arizona inclusive of LGBTQ+ youth and emerging adults (ages 13-25) who represent different historically oppressed racial and ethnic groups, abilities, and socio-economic groups using evidence-based and culturally attuned methods.  a.  Research question: What is the effectiveness of adapted youth participatory action research methods?  Are youth empowered?  4.  Plan and offer a statewide youth-focused conference (adjacent to the Annual AZ Lets Get Better Together Conference). Youth will draw from community needs assessment data to plan the conference.  a.  Research question: Does the youth conference increase perceived meaningful dialogue and educate community?  b.  Research question: How is health promotion theory advanced?  5.  Build a toolkit tentatively titled, LGBTQ+ Youth Community Prevention Model  a.  Research question: What is the degree of model uptake?   ",
FP00026113,376,,,,,1,,,"     Type 2 Diabetes among Hispanics/Latinos. Effective self-management is a challenge for most persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and this challenge is more difficult for Latino elders who are affected by the co-occurrence of depression. A recent multi-site study, revealed individuals of Mexican heritage exhibited a disproportionately high rate of diabetes/depression comorbidity. Although much research has been conducted on self-care behaviors to manage diabetes, less in-depth data exists regarding daily barriers and challenges to self-care among Hispanic/Latino elders experiencing symptoms of depression.      Deep and culturally-sensitive understanding of self-care challenges. In Phase 1 of this mixed methods study, we will conduct rigorous Integrative Mixed Methods (IMM) in a purposive stratified sample, of 108 Latino elders selected by gender, age group, and acculturation status, and who are affected by the type 2 diabetes/depression co-morbidity. We will also select one member of the elders family who knows best that elder. In Phase 2, of this mixed methods study, we will conduct qualitative focus question interviews for in-depth, contextual data in a purposive sub-sample of 60 of these elders, and also separately with their close family member. The (QUAL+QUAN) integration of these quantitative and qualitative data will generate new knowledge regarding major challenges imposed by depression. These integrative mixed methods data will better inform implementation planning of self-care educational intervention modules that can be disseminated and implemented to help Latino elders affected by co-occurring type 2 diabetes and depression.      Developing self-care intervention modules that are scale-up ready. These integrative mixed methods interviews will thus yield narratives on the process of daily self-care behaviors, to inform the development of culturally-responsive diabetes self-care modules that focus on problem solving and coping skills education for improving diabetes self-care in areas of diet and exercise/physical activity. We will also examine aspects of acceptability for Latino elders ages 55 to 80, and how these modules can be designed as scale-up ready for dissemination and implementation in the home settings. This dissemination and implementation planning will be informed by the revised RE-AIM/PRISM framework.",
FP00026188,377,,,,,1,,,"Current evidence-based behavioral interventions, such as the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), remain challenging to implement within the current US healthcare system. Advancements in mobile health (mHealth) technology have shown promise for enhancing the uptake, scalability, and sustainability of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) interventions, though few have been evaluated beyond their initial efficacy or generalized from one population to another. The proposed project addresses a critical need for evidence-based MVPA interventions that are generalizable, utilize reliable technology, are easy to use, can be tailored to an individuals progress, and provide sustainable outcomes for chronic disease prevention. The proposed sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) aims to enhance and generalize our previously successful WalkIT mHealth intervention to increase MVPA over 12 months among a new sample of 680 insufficiently active overweight/obese adults (18-60 yrs) with prediabetes. In intervention phase 1, participants will be randomized to either a treatment arm (all participants will begin with static goals + positive reinforcement, as this parallels the standard advice of 30 min/day given by healthcare providers) OR an accelerometer-feedback control condition. Phase 2 will evaluate intervention responsiveness at day 45. Weak/non-responders, defined as participants who met <40% of daily MVPA goals, will be re-randomized to either adaptive goals + positive reinforcement OR continue with static goals + positive reinforcement for the duration of the intervention. Phase 3 will randomize half of participants in each intervention group at month 11 to receive a maintenance module adapted from an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Physical Activity intervention to help participants transition from artificial reinforcement within the intervention to reinforcement naturally occurring in their own daily environment. Primary aims will: (1) compare efficacy of each treatment arm (static goals + positive reinforcement; adaptive goals + positive reinforcement) to an accelerometer-feedback control condition, (2) compare treatment arms after re-randomization of static-goal weak/non-responders to the adaptive goal + positive reinforcement condition, and (3) evaluate the efficacy of the maintenance module at months 13.5, 15, and 18 on daily MVPA likelihood and duration using accelerometers. A secondary aim will examine between-group differences on physiological measures (e.g., HbA1c, blood pressure, fitness), secondary health behaviors (e.g., self-reported PA, diet, sleep), and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., health-related quality of life, PA self-efficacy). An exploratory aim will examine moderating effects of neighborhood walkability and social determinants of health on intervention efficacy. The proposed study would provide evidence that adaptive goal setting benefits adults with prediabetes who fail to respond to static goals, demonstrate generalizability of the WalkIT intervention and offer clinicians an evidence-based alternative for prescribing exercise as medicine.",

Chronic hematological cancer (CHC) patients (i.e., chronic leukemias, low grade lymphomas, myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and  myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPNs]) have extended disease courses that are often different from solid tumor cancers, facing chronic sleep disturbances often associated with fatigue, emotional distress (anxiety and depression), and inflammation, which often persist into survivorship. Medications are most commonly prescribed for cancer patients with sleep disturbance; however, they often come with side effects and risk for long-term dependence. Given the chronic and unresolved nature of CHC patients sleep disturbances, there is a need for non-pharmacologic strategies to reduce sleep disturbance in CHC patients. Meditation is a safe and effective non-pharmacologic approach for improving a range of cancer-related symptoms. However, meditation interventions have typically been delivered in-person, limiting uptake and widespread dissemination due to patient-reported barriers. Smartphone applications (apps) are a novel intervention approach for delivering meditation and address cancer patients barriers to participating in in-person interventions (i.e., fatigue, pain, transportation, and scheduling difficulties). Calm is a popular and highly reviewed consumer-based smartphone app that provides an innovative, accessible and scalable platform through which to deliver meditation to CHC patients. We propose a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of an eight-week smartphone-18 based meditation intervention (10 min/day meditation via Calm mobile app) as compared to a health education 19 podcast control group (10 min/day podcasts) to reduce sleep disturbance (primary outcome), fatigue, emotional 20 distress (anxiety, depression), and markers of inflammation (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and CRP; secondary outcomes) 21 in male and female hematological patients.

FP00026229,381,,,,,1,,,"In the United States (U.S.), African Americans (AA) are disproportionately affected by HIV and have the most severe HIV burden compared to other racial and ethnic groups.1 While this disparity spans across multiple age groups, the HIV burden among older (= 50 years of age) AAs has become an increasing public health concern.2-4 Among older adults, AAs accounted for 42.0% of all new infections in 2016; a rate that is approximately 8 times higher than whites and 2 times higher than Hispanics/Latinos.2 In addition, AAs comprise the largest proportion (39.0%) of older people living with HIV (PLWH).2 The mortality rate of older AA PLWH (41.1 per 100,000) exceeds that of older white and Hispanic PLWH (4.6 per 100,000 and 13.8 per 100,000, respectively).2 Our previous work, as well as others, have shown that in order to live healthier, longer lives and reduce risk of HIV transmission, PLWH must be engaged along the HIV care continuum (i.e., linked to care, retained in care, adherent to medication, and virally suppressed).5-7Although almost half of PLWH in the U.S. are 50 years of age and older,2 factors that affect engagement in the HIV care continuum among older PLWH have received little attention; especially among older AA PLWH.8 Despite evidence showing the benefits of engaging in the HIV care continuum, older AA PLWH are less likely to engage in the HIV care continuum compared to their racial and ethnic counterparts, which may begin to explain the HIV burden disparity.1,9 Older AA PLWH face significant barriers to engagement and multiple stigmas (e.g., HIV, age, race, gender) may be a factor.8 HIV-related stigma is a known barrier to care engagement, 8,10-17 but the means by which it and other forms of stigma affects engagement among older AA PLWH is not well established.8 Prior studies with this population have focused mostly on medication adherence, were cross-sectional, qualitative, and had small sample sizes.8 Our previous work suggests that stigma is negatively associated with engagement in care among older AA PLWH.18 In addition, there is a current lack of research on understanding the mechanisms through which stigma impacts engagement. In other words, does stigma impact engagement directly or indirectly through other variables/mechanisms (i.e., mediators)?  Older AA PLWH are disproportionately affected by substance use issues,19 stress,19 mental and physical health comorbidities,8,20 lack of social support,21 and complex patient-provider relationships.8,17,21 These variables may mediate or moderate care engagement. It is critical to identify factors that facilitate or impede engagement so future interventions can be developed to increase engagement in the HIV care continuum among older AA PLWH and to reduce this health disparity.The purpose of this study is to conduct a longitudinal sequential, explanatory mixed methods study22 among older AA PLWH living in Kentucky and Ohio (states listed as priority areas in the plan to end the HIV epidemic)23,24 to examine the effects of multiple forms of stigma on engagement in the HIV care continuum directly and indirectly through different mechanisms (i.e., substance use, stress, comorbidities). Our central hypothesis is that among older AA PLWH, high levels of stigma will longitudinally result in lower rates of retention in care, medication adherence, and viral suppression. The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1: Examine the relationship between multiple stigmas and engagement in the HIV care continuum. Quantitative data will be obtained through surveys (N = 536) at baseline, and every six months for two years. Aim 2: Evaluate the mediating and moderating effects of substance use, stress, mental and physical health comorbidities, patient-provider relationships, and social support on stigma and engagement in the HIV care continuum. Longitudinal moderated mediation models will be developed to assess substance use, stress, and comorbidities as mediators and social support and patient-provider relationships as moderators. Aim 3: Qualitatively describe barriers and facilitators to engagement in the HIV care continuum. Semi-structured in-depth qualitative and photo-elicitation interviews will be conducted at 12- and 24-month follow-up on a stratified sample of 40 older AA PLWH to assess barriers and facilitators. At the integration stage, qualitative findings will be used to explain and elaborate on the quantitative results.This innovative study will use a longitudinal sequential, explanatory mixed methods approach to assess the impact of stigma on engagement in the HIV care continuum among older AA PLWH  a population that is often ignored. It is expected that the findings from this study will advance our knowledge on the mechanisms through which multiple forms of stigma impacts engagement in care. The research will provide critical information to inform intervention development to improve engagement in the HIV care continuum among older AA PLWH and decrease the disparities in HIV burden and mortality by targeting specific mechanisms.",
FP00026229_Res1,382,,,,,1,,,"Project SummaryIn order to live healthier, longer lives and reduce the risk of HIV transmission, people living with HIV (PLWH) must be engaged along the HIV care continuum, which means being linked to HIV care, retained in HIV care, adherent to medication, and virally suppressed. Due to systemic racism and healthcare inequities, African Americans (AA) living with HIV are consistently less engaged in HIV care which leads to lower rates of viral suppression compared to their racial counterparts. Additionally, older (= 50 years of age) AA people living with HIV (OAAPLWH), a population often overlooked, are less likely to be engaged in care and virally suppressed compared to their older racial counterparts; in some areas, like Ohio, they have rates similar to the younger age groups. Although OAAPLWH are less likely to be engaged in HIV care and virally suppressed, factors that impact these outcomes have received little attention. OAAPLWH face many challenges to engagement, and these challenges may be due to multiple stigmatized identities (e.g., HIV, age, race, gender, and sexual orientation). These stigmatized identities may intersect or converge, a concept known as intersectional stigma, to shape OAAPLWHs experiences, which in turn severely impacts engagement. Research on intersectional stigma among OAAPLWH is scarce. Most studies have been cross-sectional, qualitative, and/or only focused on one specific subgroup. In addition, the research is lacking on addressing the longitudinal effects and the mechanisms through which intersectional stigma impacts engagement and suppression among OAAPLWH. Mechanisms like housing stability, food insecurity, coping, and substance use. The purpose of this study is to conduct a longitudinal sequential, explanatory mixed methods study among OAAPLWH to examine the longitudinal effects of intersectional stigma on HIV care outcomes. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) examine the longitudinal effects of intersectional stigma on HIV care outcomes (i.e., retention in care, medication adherence, and viral suppression), 2) identify the pathways through which intersectional stigma affects HIV care outcomes, and 3) examine the factors like social support, resilience, and the patient-provider relationship that buffer the effects of intersectional stigma on HIV care outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that among OAAPLWH, severity of experiences of intersectional stigma will be inversely related to retention in care, medication adherence, and viral suppression. This mixed-methods study will involve surveys (N = 1,375) conducted at baseline, 6- , 12, 18- , and 24-month follow-up, in-depth interviews (n = 40) conducted at 12- and 24- month follow-up, and photo elicitation interviews (n = 40) conducted at 12- and 24-month follow-up. We will obtain data from individuals living in Kentucky and Ohio, states listed as priority areas in the plan to end the HIV epidemic. The findings from this innovative study will advance our knowledge on the mechanisms through which intersectional stigma impacts engagement in care among OAAPLWH.",
FP00026261,383,,,,,1,,,"Chronic symptom burden among cancer patients/survivors is debilitating and costly. Long term, accessible, and effective solutions for ongoing symptom management in ~15.5 million US cancer patients/survivors are sorely needed as chronic symptom burden costs the healthcare system an estimated $125 billion every year. Cancer patients suffer from a wide range of symptoms affecting quality of life that persist into survivorship and can last more than a decade. Our feasibility studies, and 100 letters of support, show that cancer patients/survivors want and are willing to participate in complementary strategies to minimize their symptom burden.The benefits of meditation (i.e., mindfulness-based therapies) for alleviating fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance in cancer is well demonstrated. In-person meditation, usually delivered at a cancer center may improve symptoms, but such programs are expensive and difficult to sustain. Some patients struggle to attend even short-term programs due to distance, scheduling, and symptom burden. While technological solutions hold promise as accessible, flexible, low-cost and scalable approaches, long-term engagement with commercial mobile applications (i.e., apps) is very low. Current meditation apps are limited in their engagement, acceptability, and applicability to cancer patients/survivors unique experiences and needs. Despite over 150 mobile apps marketed for cancer, NONE include user supported, evidence-based strategies to increase engagement in meditation. To improve the long-term uptake and impact of mHealth in patient populations, the Center for eHealth Research and Disease Management recommends stakeholder feedback in the early design phase to develop interventions targeted for end users. To date, there has been a dearth of evidence-based apps because: (1) NO commercially designed meditation apps have been evaluated for feasibility or efficacy in cancer patients/surivors and (2) NO researcher-designed meditation apps have made it to commercialization. In contrast, behavioral scientists at ASU, cancer providers at Mays Cancer Center, and developers at Calm are partnering to create a standalone meditation app integrating evidence-based techniques for long-term cancer patient/survivor needs.Calm is a consumer-based meditation app accessible across smartphone platforms (Android and iOS) with 75 million downloads and 2 million subscribers. In 2018, Calm was the top downloaded health and fitness app. We propose to leverage the Calm platform designed for the general population, to develop a standalone cancer-specific meditation app that reflects the unique physical, psychological, cognitive and social needs of cancer patients/survivors by engaging patients and providers in the design and feasibility evaluation stages.There is currently an unmet need for commercially available, tailored, evidence-based meditation apps specifically designed for cancer patients/survivors. We have identified six specific adaptations needed to accommodate the clinical manifestations of cancer patients/survivors including: 1) non-body and non-breath focused meditations, 2) positions and practice that do not induce fatigue, 3) context specific meditations e.g. during chemo, 4) self-tracking of symptoms, 5) content on grief, trauma etc, specific to meditation practice, and 6) patient supports specific to ongoing meditation practice. Without such adaptations, and ultimately efficacy testing, patients will not experience the full benefits of meditation nor engage with the app long term, providers will not prescribe the app to cancer patients, and the app may not be eligible for long term, cancer-specific insurance reimbursement.Using the IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework we will conduct the following aims:Specific Aim 1: Using two focus groups, we will INTEGRATE our formative work, the social cognitive theory, and perspectives from our experienced-user advisory committee (N=20) who will use the current Calm platform to identify design content and features for a standalone cancer-specific app prototype leveraging the commercial infrastructure of the Calm platform. Our advisory committee will consist of both cancer patients/survivors (n=10; 5 of each) and health care providers (n=10).Specific Aim 2: DESIGN a meditation app prototype tailored to cancer patients/survivors unique needs including content related to cancer-related experiences, emotions, symptoms, physical and psychological needs, cancer-specific symptom self monitoring, social support and sense of belonging within the app and through Facebook.Specific Aim 3: ASSESS (i.e., beta-test) the prototypes form and function with cancer patients/survivors (N=30). We will use Bowens feasibility model to determine via surveys and interviews: (a) acceptability (satisfaction, perceived appropriateness, perceived positive/negative effects); (b) demand (use of the app, interest or intention to use); (c) practicality (how it makes them feel, ease of use); (d) adaptation (suggestions for modifications to improve performance for cancer patients/survivors); and (e) integration (how can the app be integrated into the cancer system) Feasibility benchmarks: >80% of cancer patients/survivors will accept the prototype, demand the prototype for themselves and other cancer patients/survivors, and find it practical. Data from Aim 3 will guide refinement of the prototype to be tested in a fully powered RCT to establish long term engagement (Phase 2). This work will result in an evidence based, cancer-specific meditation app through a commercial platform that can be scaled and sold at discounted costs to clinic providers and directly to patients (SHARE; Phase 3).",

A barrier to developing effective rehabilitative approaches is our lack of knowledge regarding which specific aspects of should be targeted to reduce falls in people with PD. For example, most therapists are aware that training reactive stepping (i.e., the quick steps to regain balance after a loss of balance) may reduce falls for people with PD. However, there is limited evidence directly relating poor reactive stepping responses to falls in people with PD, and no evidence identifying which aspects of stepping (size, speed, latency?) to target in therapy to have the greatest impact on falls. Similarly, while there is some evidence that standing balance (i.e., sway) is related to falls, the specific aspects of sway (area, oscillation, relation to base of support?) that are most related to falls in people with PD are not well understood. This represents a critical barrier to development of effective and efficient fall-reduction rehabilitative. approaches. This project will fill this gap by identifying the specific aspects of reactive balance and standing sway that are related to prospective falls. This information will immediately contribute to clinicians ability to develop therapeutic plans to treat falls. In addition, these data will facilitate additional research aimed at developing approaches and technologies to improve these outcomes, and testing the efficacy and effectiveness of such approaches toward the treatment of falls.

FP00026272,386,,,,,1,,,"Cable machines are extremely versatile because they allow for access with a wheelchair, have adjustable cable pulleys to adapt to any height, and are safer to use than free weights. Our dated exercise machines do not allow for the seats to be moved out of the way and we have had to make less than ideal adjustments for our participants who use wheelchairs. For safe and effective use of the cable machine by our wheelchair users, it would very helpful to have a chest strap system in order to stabilize the upper body.

We expansion of our program to all neurological conditions and disabilities, it has become ever more important to reliably monitor heart rates during exercise. Some of our participants with congenital heart defects (common in people with Down syndrome), those with myotonic muscular dystrophy, and those who had a stroke should not exceed a certain heart rate threshold. In the past, we have had issues donning heart rate chest straps because not everyone is comfortable wearing them (i.e., sensory issues), and some of our older ones tend to slip and not give accurate readings. We believe wrist worn heart rate monitors will be better tolerated by many and may have better longevity due to being rechargeable. They are also less invasive to put on (i.e., don). Additionally, wrist worn monitors will allow us to track energy expenditure which will give us new insight into the quantity and quality of the workouts. Lastly, we need tablets in order to use text-to-speech or picture-to-speech apps and other assistive software for members who prefer non-verbal communication or who have speech, language, or other communication deficits.

Mounting evidence demonstrates the importance of metabolic factors in breast cancer. These factors may be especially important in individuals treated with PI3K inhibitors, drugs that induce hyperglycemia through disruption of insulin signaling. Hyperglycemia is one of the primary toxicities of PI3K inhibitors. Data from pre-clinical studies show that the compensatory hyperinsulinemia induced by PI3K inhibitors leads to partial restoration of PI3K signaling and promotes cellular proliferation. Energy balance interventions, particularly exercise and intermittent fasting, are well-tolerated and favorably impact insulin, glucose, and other metabolic biomarkers in women with early-stage breast cancer. Research regarding the impact of these strategies on the metabolic dysregulation induced by PI3K inhibitors in advanced disease are needed.The preventing Hyperglycemia with prolonged Overnight fasting with or without exercise in women treated with PI3K inhibitors for advanced breast cancEr (HOPE) study, will evaluate a three-arm randomized trial to evaluate the impact of either 1) prolonged overnight fasting alone, 2) prolonged overnight fasting with moderate intensity exercise versus 3) an attention control on fasting glucose and other metabolic markers in 201 women with advanced hormone receptor (HR)+ breast cancer initiating treatment with endocrine therapy in combination with a PI3K inhibitor. Participants would undergo assessment of fasting glucose and related metabolic biomarkers, as well as assessment of physical activity, diet, physical function and patient reported outcomes at baseline (prior to the initiation of PI3K inhibitor) and 3, 6, and 9 months after study enrollment. The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the impact of the interventions (vs control) on fasting glucose in women who remain on the PI3K inhibitor at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include other metabolic biomarkers, patient-reported outcomes, and health behaviors. The HOPE study will also explore the impact of the intervention on tolerability and efficacy of the PI3K inhibitors.The overarching goal of the HOPE study is to determine whether prolonged overnight fasting with or without moderate intensity exercise can mitigate the adverse metabolic sequalae, and improve treatment outcomes, in women with advanced breast cancer treated with PI3K inhibitors.",

Unfortunately, this aspect of modern biomedical research is often ignored or glossed over, leading to loss of scientific rigor and potential pollution of the scientific literature. Evidence collected by those who have studied this problem suggests that most preclinical investigators are aware that collection, processing, storage and handling expose biospecimens to pre-analytical variables (PAVs) that have the potential to produce misleading results in downstream clinical research, but tend to give this issue low priority because these PAVs are often undocumented and because there is little to no professional accountability in this arena. Thus every year, improprieties and inconsistencies in pre-analytical sample handling and storage generate large numbers of costly false leads in biomedical research. Experts in the field agree that this unacceptable problem must be addressed.

FP00026297,390,,,,,1,,,"This project is to develop a strategy of local and targeted delivery of trans-resveratrol (RES) containing nanoparticles (NPs) to subcutaneous adipose stromal stem cells (ASCs), aiming to induce browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), thereby, simultaneously reducing excess body fat and improving glycemic control. RES had a potential to induce browning of WAT, but its side toxicity and rapid hepatic catabolism, along with its low level of aqueous solubility and target specificity prevent the use of RES for WAT browning. We have successfully developed ASC-targeted RES-encapsulated nanoparticles (RES-NPs), which when administered intravenously, enhance RES delivery to ASCs and further increase the amount and activity of beige adipocytes, subsequently result in dramatic body fat and weight loss in a diet-induced obese mouse model. Even though ASC-targeted NPs had lower accumulation in the liver than non-targeted NPs, the liver still accumulated the majority of both ASC-targeted and non-targeted NPs when they were delivered intraveneously. This must be addressed. More critically, the fundamental mechnisms of WAT browning and the subsequent anti-diabete acitivities need to be studied. Therefore, in this project we propose to 1) subcutaneously inject ASC-targeted RES-NPs right above inguinal WAT for enhanced local delivery; 2) measure their binding and uptake by human and mouse adipose stromal cells, their target capacity and biodistribution in a diabetes mouse model (db/db mice); 3) determine the efficay and underlying mechanisms of WAT browning and anti-diabete activities in primary stromal cells isolated from db/db mice; 4) determine their anti-diabete activities and underlying mechanisms, and evaluate safety in db/db mice. We hypothesize that subcutaneous delivery of ASC-targeted RES-NPs can improve their ASC target capacity, enhance local WAT browning, further result in improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity and reduced body fat. This new approach will provide spatially-targeted and sustained delivery of RES to ASCs in subcutaneous WAT, thereby bypassing the liver and other tissues. This approach should minimize administration frequency, enhancing compliance, and most importantly, maximizing overall treatment efficacy while decreasing toxicity.This project has following specific aims:Aim #1: Determine ASC-targeted RES-NPs characteristics in vitro, and their biodistribution and target efficacy in db/db mice. The ASC-targeted RES-NPs will be synthesized using a sonication process. We will measure their characteristics including size, zeta potential, polydispersity, solubility and stability of RES and NPs, RES release study, and physicochemical characterization. The binding and uptake of RES-NPs by human adipose stromal cells will be determined in an ex vivo experiment. RES-NPs biodistribution will be measured using an IVIS imaging system. The ASC target capacity in stromal vascular fractions isolate from mouse subcutaneous and other adipose depots will be quantified using flow cytometry.Aim #2: Determine the efficacy by which ASC-targeted RES-NPs induces browning and improves insulin signaling in primary stromal cells derived from the db/db mouse. ASCs from db/db mice will be treated with non-targeted or ASC-targeted RES-NPs. Cell differentiation, browning effects, glucose uptake, insulin sensitivity and inflammation in those cells will be determined. The underlying mechanisms of WAT browning, glucose uptake and insulin signaling pathway will be determined using real-time PCR, Western blot, nuclear receptor knockdown and transactivational assays.Aim #3: Determine anti-diabetic effects and safety of ASC-targeted RES-NPs in db/db mice. Body composition, WAT histological and immunohistochemistry assay will be used to confirm browning of WAT. Insulin, glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests, and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps will be conducted to determine therapeutic effects of WAT browning via subcutaneous delivery of ASC-targeted NPs on diabetes in db/db mice. Concentrations of RES, lipids and inflammatory factors in blood, liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissues will be measured. The underlying mechanisms of anti-diabetic activities in tissues will be studied using real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry methods. To evaluate safety, we will perform complete necropsies, blood tests, and routine histological examinations of the liver, heart, aorta, kidneys, skeletal muscle, spleen, lungs, and brain.In summary: Previous studies have shown that browning of WAT leads to metabolic benefits. Proof of concept approaches such as cold acclimation induce beige adipocyte formation, but lack practical utility. RES is capable of inducing WAT browning, but has low efficacy and other limitations, which we addressed by developing ASC-targeted RES-NPs administered intravenously. This proposal will further enhance the delivery of RES-NP for inducing WAT browning by local subcutaneous injection near WAT. The outcomes of this project will establish bases for further study, by leveraging NIH R01 funds, towards to ultimate human applications. This project will strengthen student education and boost research at Texas Tech University.",
FP00026337,391,,,,,1,,,"Food insecurity (FI)-the lack of consistent access to nutritious and affordable food-has been associated with higher chronic disease prevalence and sub-optimal healthcare access/utilization. Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be food insecure and to experience sub-optimal healthcare access/utilization compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Food insecure Blacks and Hispanics living with chronic diseases are therefore at higher risk for sub-optimal healthcare access/utilization given their higher healthcare needs. This disparity may be worse for residents of areas with high racial/ethnic residential segregation or rural residents who are also at risk for sub-optimal healthcare access/utilization, but this has not been tested. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been leveraged during economic downturns through policies such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 enacted during the great recession and the Family First Corona Virus Response Act (FFCRA) of 2020 enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. SNAP and SNAP-related policies has the potential to improve healthcare access/utilization through various pathways including redirection of finances that would have been spent on food to healthcare use. However, SNAP and related policies could exacerbate racial/ethnic disparities if the intended positive effects are not experienced by racial/ethnic minorities. It is therefore critical to determine the impact of SNAP and SNAP-related policies on FI and healthcare access/utilization among Blacks and Hispanics. Previous studies examining the relationship between FI and healthcare access/utilization or examining the impact of SNAP or SNAP related policies on healthcare use are limited because they focus on only one aspect of utilization such as cost-related medication underuse, they do not control for contextual factors or they do not focus on non-Hispanic Blacks or Hispanics. The overall aim of this study is to fill this scientific gap by determining the relationship between FI, SNAP and SNAP-related policies and healthcare access/utilization among adult (= 18 years) non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics living with chronic diseases. Aim 1 will determine the relationship between FI and healthcare access/utilization, and the effect of neighborhood characteristics (rural/urban residence, census tract (CT) residential segregation) on this relationship. For specific aim 2, we will examine the impact of SNAP on FI and healthcare access/utilization. In specific aim 3 and 4, we will assess the effect of ARRA of 2009 and the FFCRA of 2020 on FI (aim 4 only) and healthcare access/utilization among our study sample of Black and Hispanic populations. We will address these aims by using the 2007-2021 public-use and access-restricted versions of the National Health Interview Survey, which is a national survey of non-institutionalized civilian population of the United States. Study findings will inform healthcare interventions and policies that aim to reduce FI and improve optimal healthcare access/utilization among vulnerable racial/ethnic minorities living with chronic diseases.",

Fifty-seven percent are obese, 57% have cardiovascular disease, and 12% have diagnosed diabetes. Engaging in regular aerobic physical activity is an established mechanism to prevent and manage these cardiometabolic diseases. The purpose of this study is test the efficacy of a culturally tailored, theory-based smartphone-delivered physical activity intervention to increase physical activity and improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors among African American women. In a 12-month, two arm randomized trial, 210 sedentary (i.e., < 60 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity) African American women with obesity (i.e., BMI >30 kg/m2) will be assigned to receive either Smart Walk, a culturally tailored, Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity promotion intervention (n=105), or a Fitbit-only comparison arm (n=105). The Smart Walk intervention group will receive a culturally tailored physical activity intervention delivered via the Smart Walk smartphone app, virtual physical activity coaching, and text messages. Features available on the Smart Walk app include: 1) personal profile pages, 2) culturally relevant multi-media (i.e., text and video) physical activity promotion modules, 3) message/discussion boards, and 4) physical activity self-monitoring/tracking feature that integrates with Fitbit activity monitors for participants to track their daily, weekly, and monthly activity. Virtual physical activity coaches will actively engage and facilitate group-based dialogue among participants on the discussion boards and provide individualized, one-on-one physical activity coaching via telephone or commercially available app-based video teleconferencing software, based on participant preference. Smart Walk participants also receive three physical activity promotion text messages each week for the duration of the active 4-month intervention. The Fitbit-only arm comparison arm will receive a Fitbit activity monitor and be encouraged to use the commercially available device to increase physical activity. We hypothesize participants in the Smart Walk intervention group will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in physical activity and cardiometabolic risk factors when compared to the Fitbit-only comparison group. Primary outcomes include self-reported and accelerometer-measured changes in physical activity. Secondary outcomes include traditional risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (i.e., BMI, blood pressure, serum lipid profiles, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance) and more novel and prognostic risk factors, including cardiorespiratory fitness, aortic pulse wave velocity, and pro-inflammation biomarkers (TNF-a, IL-1).

FP00026370,397,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARYOverview:Exploring microbe nanomachines, which may even scavenge environmental pollutants, for manufacturing nanomaterials in overcoming limitations of human-made materials in terms of both performance and scalability, have intellectual merit of expanding our horizon in nanofabrication methods as well as broader impacts on sustainable industrial development. This convergent research project is to investigate sulfide oxidizing bacteria and cellulose bacteria for nanomanufacturing of sulfur-carbon (S-C) yolk-shell nanoparticles and nanocellulose membranes toward development and fabrication of high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, and meanwhile these bacteria will desulfurize environmental and industrial pollutants or recycle agriculture or industry byproducts, with the convergent goal of developing a sustainable and environmental-friendly nanomanufacturing process.  Intellectual Merit:The shuttling problem of soluble lithium polysulfides must be solved for developing high-performance Li-S batteries. This calls for nanofabrication processes to produce a sulfur cathode structure, which can physically trap and chemically bind these polysulfides, further assisted by a functionalized battery separator as a second barrier to shut off the shuttling path. In nature, sulfide oxidizing bacteria (SOB) can oxidize sulfide pollutants into elemental sulfur nanoparticles (NPs) and store them in their bodies, while other bacteria can produce high-quality nanocellulose membrane in a fermentation process, as a separator. This project will study SOB culturing to covert sulfides into sulfur NPs, study microwave-based rapid carbonization process to transform sulfur-containing SOB into S-C yolk-shell nanostructures used for the sulfur cathode, study bacterial cellulose fermentation process and its ionically modification as the battery separator, and thus when combined in the battery, these components will work coordinately in solving the polysulfides shuttling problem toward a high-performance Li-S battery technology. Mechanism study, process development, nanostructure control and tailoring, material and structure property characterization, and the battery performance test, all these interweaved tasks together will advance our understanding on how to develop a rationally-designed nanostructure, via a potentially scalable nanofabrication process, to achieve the goal of a high-performance Li-S battery technology.  Broader Impacts:The beauty, and power, of this proposal resides in the idea of: harvesting nature-manufactured nanomaterials in overcoming performance-limitations of human-made materials; achieving high throughput for mass production through bacteria rapid reproduction in addressing the scaling issue of human-designed nanofabrication processes; converting pollutants into useful industry materials for a sustainable and green nanomanufacturing industry. While this proposal may seem to be a very primitive effort in this direction, its success will inspire much more efforts, from academic and industry, toward developing a sustainable and cost-effective microbe-based nanomanufacturing industry. By solving the polysulfides shuttling problem, the nanostructures studied in this project will contribute to develop practical Li-S battery technology. Education and outreach activities are integrated in this project for students training and broader participation. The project will train several graduate and undergraduate students with emphasis on female and minority students. An outreach component on green energy technologies will be developed to educate students in the local Student Chapter of Engineers for a Sustainable World and the local business community.  ",
FP00026375,398,,,,,1,,,"Project AbstractThe success of machine learning models hinges on whether an appropriate learning algorithmwas selected for the task of interest. Meta-learning algorithms asses the complexity ofthe training data to help select an appropriate learning model for solving the problem athand. For instance, in the context of classication, the complexity of the problem canbe characterized by understanding two complementary meta-features: (a) the amount ofoverlap between classes, and (b) the geometry of the decision boundary. The practitionertypically uses a large amount of training data to assess these meta-features, and thenselects the model class that best matches the data. However, this scenario is arguablymore appropriate in settings where one has access to large corpora of carefully curated andlabeled training data that reasonably captures the complexity of the target task. On theother hand, active learning has been proposed as a promising approach to dealing withthe paucity in curated training data  here the learner sequentially and adaptively selectsthe data points whose labels would be most informative in the learning process. While thisfamily of techniques is promising for defense applications where the labeled data is expensiveto obtain, it requires the declaration of a family of models (or hypotheses) before even seeingthe data, and therefore runs the risk of not being adaptable to dynamic environments.In this proposal we retain the virtues of meta-learning for algorithm design but extendits applicability to applications where labeled data is expensive but can be actively acquired.We leverage a combination of results from previous work done by the PIs and propose a newframework  active meta learning. This new approach provides an active, non-parametricapproach to characterizing the amount of overlap between classes and the geometry of thedecision boundary in data. With active meta learning we iteratively label points that aremaximally informative for characterizing the complexity of the classication task. Thisenables new practical applications related to model selection, particularly for situationswhere data labels are expensive. Our preliminary results demonstrate that active metalearning can help recover the geometry of the decision boundary with 50% fewer labeledexemplars. Furthermore models selected using this novel paradigm yield lower error ratesand signicantly better estimates of classication uncertainty.",
FP00026380,399,,,,,1,,,"Kidney cancer is one of the top ten most common cancers in the United States (U.S.). Individuals who are obese, particularly during adolescence and early adulthood, have an increased risk for kidney cancer. Kidney cancer incidence has increased significantly over the past 30 years, and its incidence increased more rapidly among adults aged 50 years or younger. A similar trend is seen in obesity rates during the same decades. Hispanic Americans (HAs) and Native Americans (NAs) have a higher prevalence of obesity and a heavier kidney cancer burden with higher incidence and mortality rates than European Americans (EAs). Similarly, kidney cancer incidence and obesity rates increased among the U.S. Service members and Veterans, and obesity rates among them are higher than the U.S. civilian populations. Among renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients at Banner University Medical Center Tucson (BUMCT), obesity was common among HAs and NAs, and HA and NA patients as well as obese patients were diagnosed with RCC at a younger age (under the age of 50). However, HAs and NAs are under- and poorly represented in kidney cancer research. The molecular genomic and metabolomic characteristics of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common type of kidney cancer, among them are unknown, and it is not fully understood how obesity, particularly abdominal adiposity, affects age of onset, ccRCC aggressiveness, and genomic and metabolomic characteristics.Our long-term goal is to develop diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that can be used in racially/ethnically diverse patient populations. This is a Basic Science research project using genomic and metabolomic approaches to characterize early-onset (diagnosis before the age of 50 years) and aggressive ccRCC and investigate if abdominal adiposity is associated with early-onset ccRCC metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles and if abdominal adiposity and identified genes and metabolites are associated with ccRCC aggressiveness. We hypothesize that abdominal adiposity significantly influences age of onset, and also gene expression and metabolomic characteristics of early-onset and aggressive ccRCC. This proposed study will pursue two specific aims: 1) determine relationship between abdominal adiposity, age of onset, and ccRCC aggressiveness and 2) identify transcriptomic signatures in tumors and metabolomic signatures in the blood that are associated with abdominal adiposity, age of onset, and aggressiveness.Our study is innovative in three ways. First, out project will address the gap in kidney cancer precision medicine research by a higher representation of racial/ethnic minority groups. BUMCT is uniquely located and have high representations of HA and NA RCC patients. By focusing on a previously underrepresented racial/ethnic groups with a high burden of kidney cancer and obesity-related comorbid conditions, we will gain a better understanding of the biological basis of early-onset and aggressive ccRCC. Second, instead of using imprecise measurement of obesity based on body mass index, pre-operative CT and MRI scans will be used to measure abdominal adiposity, which is shown to be a better predictor of oncologic outcomes. Third, we will use a cost effective and efficient transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling methods. This allow us to use a multi-omics approach, which was previously possible only for large-scale projects. We will use a novel computational biology approach that combines two different types of data, gene expression and serum metabolites, for the same patients to detect commonly altered pathways and driver genes. The inclusion of previously understudied minority groups along with more precise measurements of adiposity and a novel multi-omics approach will allow us to discover novel genomic and metabolomic signatures and associations, which otherwise are missed in studies using a single approach.Characterizing molecular and metabolic profiles of early-onset cRCC and understanding impacts of abdominal adiposity will contribute to advancement of kidney cancer research and care. Obesity increases risk of RCC diagnosis, but obesity is also associated with better survival. Identified signatures and more accurate measurements of abdominal adiposity likely provide insights on biological mechanisms of this obesity paradox which is not previously explored thoroughly. Moreover, RCC is a metabolomic disease. Genomic alteration causes metabolic changes early in ccRCC development and progression. Identified gene and metabolites associated with abdominal adiposity and early-onset ccRCC may be used for diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. Currently, there are no biomarkers for kidney cancer screening, and prognosis is based on clinical imaging and histology instead of molecular and metabolomic signatures. Early detection through screening will allow for less invasive clinical intervention reducing risk of complications. This is especially important for patients who are diagnosed at a younger age and who are at increased risk for recurrence and developing another tumor on the other kidney. The findings from this study will help clinicians select an effective treatment and post-surgery follow-up plan for patients of diverse backgrounds.",
FP00026384,400,,,,,1,,,"As the loss of life continues around the world due to multidrug resistant diseases (Malaria, Tuberculosis, HIV, Influenza, Microbial Infections) and secondary diseases (Hypertension with Diabetes Mellitus Type II, Hospital Acquired Pneumonia) the World Health Organization is reporting that most major pharmaceutical companies have abandoned research and development activities for the creation of new antimicrobial drugs. Also, the recent COVID19 pandemic brought to light how desperately proper antiviral therapies are needed for man, woman and child. During the COVID19 pandemic initial studies incorrectly concluded that hydroxychloroquine was the best therapy for COVID19 patients, thus temporarily placing many in harm's way. The need for immediate and conclusive knowledge regarding the efficacy of polytherapies can be solved by technological innovations that can ingest massive omics and biomedical data, then quickly deliver novel candidate drug targets and polytherapies within minutes to hours. Such a system is not currently globally available to scientists. PolyTheraphy AI aims to provide users with informative dashboards that summarize the results of multi-omics, clinical data, and quantum machine learning heterogeneous network (HetNet) analyses. Also, it will provide users with a mixed reality immersive environment where they can simultaneously view the dashboards and HetNets through Microsoft HoloLens2 device. HetNets are important in biomedical research because they allow scientists to gain many novel insights from its complex relationships through machine learning. Peer reviewed machine learning algorithms such as G-Meta, CRank, DeepLGP, and GNNExplainer were chosen for extension and conversion into quantum machine learning algorithms. G-Meta works well for quickly pre-learning subgraph identities in HetNets that are small to large in size as well as HetNets that are sparse to dense. HetNets that contain novel candidate drug targets are typically sparse and G-Meta is well suited for this low data scenario. The CRank algorithm works well for the rapid prioritization of network communities based on structure of the network, and this is important because it can find communities with lots of biomedical evidence (known drug targets) and those with the fewest (candidate drug targets). DeepLGP is a graph convolutional network (GCN) algorithm that can distinguish between real lncRNA and protein coding gene pairs and those that arent, in an effort to prioritize target protein coding genes. Therefore, DeepLGP can be used with CRank to prioritize the lncRNA communities with the most and least biomedical evidence. This will help us detect novel candidate non-coding drug targets. GNNExplainer explains how machine learning algorithms reached their conclusions and thus will be valuable for validating the conclusions of the machine learning workflow. The ultimate goal of the PolyTherapy AI study is to establish a cloud-enabled computing platform that uses an automated quantum machine learning workflow to rapidly deliver evidenced based polytherapies for any disease.",
FP00026420,401,,,,,1,,,"The treatment of children with cleft lip and palate (CLP) involves the primary surgical repairment of the cleft, followed by secondary treatments  like pharyngeal flap, maxillofacial surgery and speech therapy. India has the second highest number of children born yearly with CLP in the world, second only to China.  In lower and middle income countries like India, most of the children with CLP live in rural areas and remain untreated due to the lack of awareness of services, limited availability of speech and language pathologists, and travel expenses to remotely located clinics.  Since the children acquire normal structural appearance after the  primary surgery, the secondary issues like velopharyngeal dysfunction and speech related issues remain highly neglected  and untreated.   Such untreated children develop poor communication skills, which affects their educational and social success. The hypernasality is  considered a primary outcome measure used by speech language pathologists (SLPs) while assessing cleft speech characteristics. However, there are a limited  number of SLPs available in India and they work in the clinics located in urban areas. There are community  health care workers associated with rural areas who can identify children with speech concerns and refer for further treatment at the clinics located in urban areas. But these community health care workers  are not trained for  evaluating the CLP speech characteristics. We propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based mobile health (mHealth) application for the identification of children with CLP who need further treatment in the rural areas of India. This is a collaborative work among Arizona State University, USA, Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, India, and All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, India. We make use of a database of Kannada (an Indian language speaking in Karnataka state) speaking children with CLP  collected at AIISH to develop a hypernasality prediction algorithm for the Indian language. We evaluate the algorithms performance on newly collected speech samples using mobile phones  in realistic clinical settings. Using AI-based algorithm, we develop mHealth application. Initial usability studies of this mHealth application are going to be evaluated  by SLPs of AIISH.We recruit community health care workers (CHWs) from the various regions of Karnataka state of India. We train these CHWs for the identification of children with CLP using  the mHealth application. Further, these trained CHWs conduct field studies by visiting rural areas. Parallelly the samples recorded from the mHealth application will be evaluated by SLPs to evaluate the performance  and reliability of AI-based identification of children with CLP. Berishas group developed AI-based algorithms for the objective evaluation of hypernasality. The objective scores were evaluated on American English databases and showed significant correlation with the experts perceptual ratings. These preliminary results show promise that the proposed approach will yield a successful framework for accurately characterizing hypernasal  speech of children with CLP.  Hence, we expect that the mHealth application developed for Indian language will be successful in the identification of children with CLP in the rural areas of India.",
FP00026420_Res1,402,,,,,1,,,"Cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) and other craniofacial conditions are considered a global health issue contributing to the burden of disease in the World Report on Disabilities from the World Health Organization (2011) [1]. India has 27,000-33,000 children with CLP born yearly, second only to China. Almost all children undergo a primary surgery to repair the cleft; however, for most children in rural India, follow-up stops there.This contrasts with more developed countries where most children undergo additional medical services and/or rehabilitation for the purpose of improving communication outcomes [2], directly leading to improved social and educational outcomes [3].Identifying the children who require additional intervention post primary surgery requires perceptual evaluation of hypernasality in speech by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). That is, SLPs listen to a patients speech for subtle acoustic cues that indicate an inability to achieve adequate velopharyngeal closure during speech production. However, there are a limited number of SLPs in India and they work in clinics located in urban areas. As a result, children with CLP in rural areas are treated by community health workers (CHW) who are not trained to detect the presence of hypernasality, leaving many children untreated, despite the availability of services.We propose an AI-based mHealth app that can be deployed in community health clinics to automatically identify children with CLP who would benefit from additional intervention and to facilitate additional treatment with cleft-care teams in urban areas. This multidisciplinary project builds on extensive work done by the PIs in the US and a collaboration with speech clinicians (All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH)) and researchers (India Institute of Technology (IIT)) in India that have outreach in ruralcommunities. The mHealth app has the potential to improve access to clinical services for children with CLP who would otherwise go untreated.R21 Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven mHealth app that identifies children with CLP who would benefit from additional intervention by automatically and objectively measuring hypernasality in their speech.Approach: The team at ASU has developed and validated an AI algorithm for the automatic evaluation of hypernasality in American English. We will extend this algorithm to Kannada, a Dravidian language, spoken in Karnataka, India using an existing database of 60 children with CLP and healthy controls collected by ourpartners at IIT. We will integrate this algorithm within an mHealth application that can be used by community healthcare workers working in rural areas of India who are supervised by SLPs at AIISH. R21 Aim 2: Conduct an initial evaluation of the mHealth application algorithms and usability on newly collected speech samples.Approach: We will conduct an initial evaluation of the algorithms and mHealth app from SA1 by collecting new speech samples from 30 children with CLP and 30 controls at AIISH, Mysore. We will evaluate the algorithms using the correlation and mean absolute error between predicted hypernasality (by the mHealth app) and the perceptual hypernasality ratings (rated by the SLPs). We will analyze the predictive performance of the algorithms and the SLP and CHW users experience of the mHealth application using the mHealth app Usability Questionnaire (MUAQ) [4].R33 Aim 3: Refine the mHealth application algorithms and user interface based on the results of SA2. Approach: We will use the feedback obtained from the initial evaluation of the algorithms and the usability assessment of the mHealth application to refine the algorithms and the user interface of the application. R33 Aim 4: Recruit and train ten community health care worker teams in the region around Mysore District, India on how to use the mHealth application; based on their feedback, make final user interface refinements, and design a final protocol for field validation of the mHealth tool. Approach: Ten community health care worker teams will be recruited, trained, and supervised at AIISH to use the mHealth application. We will use the feedback from community health workers (CHW) to make small final refinements to the AI and to finalize a field validation protocol for SA5.R33 Aim 5: Conduct a field validation and implementation study comparing the objective measures provided by the mHealth app as it is used by community health care workers to the clinical ratings of hypernasality by SLPs at AIISH and parent experience. Approach: The ten CHW teams from SA4 will enroll 100 children (50 with CLP and 50 controls) between the ages 6-12 years. They will use the mHealth tool to evaluate hypernasality at two sessions within 1 week of each other. The speech samples will be clinically evaluated for hypernasality by 5 SLPs at AIISH via telepractice. Statistical analyses will be used to confirm the construct validity and reliability of the tool. CHWs,and SLPs will rate usability of the mHealth app with this larger sample. Parents will rate their experience in the assessment process.Impact: If successful, the validated mHealth tool will identify children with CLP in need of medical and/or rehabilitative services to improve communication outcomes. This can have a direct positive impact on social and educational outcomes of these children.",
FP00026442,403,,,,,1,,,"The proposed exploratory studies will develop a novel mechanism of intervention to ultimately mitigate the ethanol (E)-related augmentation of neuron death in the developing brain. Central to this proposal is that this enhanced intrinsic apoptotic process is a consequence of E-induced dysregulation of cellular redox potential which can be normalizing by augmentation of glutathione (GSH) and activation of GSH homeostasis systems. In the presence of E, GSH homeostasis is compromised due to a decrease in cysteine availability, the rate-limiting step in GSH synthesis. The resulting enhanced neuron death can be partially prevented by increasing Nrf2 expression and prevented by stabilizing cysteine availability. The proposed studies will elucidate placental/trophoblast redox homeostasis mechanisms and enable the placenta to optimize the redox homeostasis systems in the fetal compartment to mitigate impacts of E. This intervention strategy which specifically targets the placenta leaves unperturbed the highly orchestrated fetal brain homeostasis signaling pathways that are required for optimal brain development. Hypothesis. E has been shown to elicit oxidative stress in the placenta concomitant with placental damage (12). However, placental redox homeostasis signaling pathways are incompletely defined. The two-fold central hypothesis: First, we propose that the placenta contains Nrf2-dependent GSH homeostasis systems which are negatively impacted by E.  Secondly, these redox perturbing effects and those that E elicits directly in fetal brain can be mitigated by a new and novel intervention by normalizing E inhibition of the placental Xc- cystine transporter by specific nanocarrier targeting of xCT in cytotrophoblasts.Specific Aim1: The intent of the first Aim is to extend recent findings to elucidate key GSH/Nrf2-dependent mechanisms underlying dysregulation of placental of redox homeostasis by E. The focus will be on inhibitory effects of E on known crucial elements of Nrf2-dependent GSH homeostasis. These include impacts on Nrf2/ARE redox-related activation and two transport systems, EAAC1 (cys) and Xc- (cystine). This approach is well supported by preliminary and published data from the Henderson lab, thus feasibility is high.  Specific Aim2 will test the hypothesis that normalization of placental Nrf2 activity and/or cys or cystine transport can be engaged by nanotargeting. And, that maintaining baseline or enhancing Nrf2 and/or xCT activity specifically/only in trophoblast can be an intervention to maintain neuroprotective supplies of cysteine to the developing brain. Dr. Wangs lab has extensive experience with specific targeted delivery of NP-loaded drugs, which supports the feasibility of this approach.",
FP00026442_Res1,404,,,,,1,,,"Proposed exploratory studies will develop a novel intervention manipulating the placenta to mitigate the ethanol (E)-related increase of apoptotic neuron death in the developing brain. Oxidative stress/redox imbalance is a critical driver of teratogenesis. Such a redox shift occurs in fetal brain/neurons exposed to E and elicits enhanced apoptotic death of fetal neurons. This E-induced intrinsic apoptotic response in fetal neurons can be blocked by increasing cellular cysteine (Cys) by N-acetylcysteine treatment or by activation of Nrf2-regulated GSH homeostasis systems which increase cellular Cys and reverse the redox imbalance. Knowledge gaps to be filled are new understandings of placental redox control systems impacted by E and a new/novel means to counter the above E effects on fetal neuron survival without off target responses impacting brain development. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the placenta contains Nrf2-dependent GSH homeostasis systems (Xc- and EAAC1 as key components) which are negatively impacted by E. This E effect compromises placental support of fetal brain redox control by Cys/CySS and GSH/GSSG redox couples. Secondly, the E-related redox perturbing effects in fetal brain can be mitigated by a novel intervention that normalizes E dysregulation of trophoblast Nrf2, the CySS transport system (Xc-), and the Cys transport system (EAAC1). This rescue will be by specific nanocarrier targeting of these 3 redox control systems in trophoblasts.Specific Aim 1 will elucidate placenta redox control components which enable this temporary organ to regulate the vital Cys/CySS redox couple in the fetus and effects of E on this. These are impacts on Nrf2/ARE redox-related activation and the two transport systems needed to enhance placental supply of Cys to the fetal brain. These concepts are supported by recent studies illustrating that trophoblast Nrf2 is dysregulated by E and preliminary data showing that E impairs in cultured trophoblasts and placenta in vivo, the CySS transporter (Xc-) and the Cys transporter (EAAC1). We have extensive experience working with these pathways in neurons, thus feasibility is high.Specific Aim 2 will develop a new rescue strategy using specific nanoparticle targeting of trophoblasts to up-regulate Nrf2-related GSH homeostasis components including EAAC1 and Xc-. This will prevent E-related damage to placental export of GSH which is extracellularly converted to Cys, which is oxidized to stable CySS that enters the fetal circulation, thereby increasing fetal neuron supply of Cys and mitigating the E-related dysregulation of redox homeostasis in fetal brain.Advantages: Specific targeting of placenta trophoblasts to optimally supply the E-exposed fetal brain with Cys, leaves unperturbed the highly orchestrated, vital fetal brain homeostasis signaling pathways which require ROS-related signaling. In summary: Normalized fetal brain redox control will occur where and when it is needed with no off-target effects on beneficial ROS signaling events.",
FP00026448,405,,,,,1,,,"It is suggested that about 75% of people with serious and life-limiting illness may benefit from enrollment in a palliative care program. However, despite an increasingly aging population and a global population plagued by chronic illnesses, gaps in palliative care education of the current and future health care workforce still remain. As such, the overarching challenges in this field include the shortfall of hospice and palliative medicine clinicians available to provide high-quality care to our chronically ill population and the subsequent lack of palliative care options for rural health care patients and providers. The Palliative Care ECHO program seeks to close this gap by linking expert specialist teams at an academic hub with primary care clinicians in rural and underserved areas to treat patients with complex serious illness. The result? Patients receive care from providers they already know and trust.Access to healthcare services becomes more difficult as disease severity progresses. Patients and families living in rural and/or underserved areas, who are of low socioeconomic status, and/or face language or cultural barriers are disproportionately affected by issues of access to care. The ECHO model is committed to addressing the needs of the most vulnerable populations by equipping communities with the right knowledge, at the right place, at the right time. In this specific project, we will leverage the ECHO model by pairing local clinicians with palliative care specialists in virtual clinics to expand the treatment capacity of patients with complex serious illness. Results of Project ECHO initiatives include reduced waste (e.g. fewer unnecessary tests, less travel), reduced hospitalizations and emergency department use, fewer adverse medical events, and improved patient function.  Additionally, as the capacity of local providers increases, access to care among vulnerable populations also increases. The Project ECHO model has been used successfully in the screening, diagnosis, and management of patients seeking palliative care. Due to the lack of palliative care resources, the ECHO model, as shown through its effectiveness in the past 14 years, can leverage a program that consists of innovative technological ways to address the limitations and provide improvements to palliative care practices.",

FP00026486_Rev2,408,,,,,1,,,"Statement of Work to:  Arizona Health Care Cost Containtment System (AHCCCS) Title:  Arizona State Opioid Response Grant  Arizona State University Data Project  Phase 2 Period: October 1, 2020  September 29, 2022 502 E Monroe Street, Suite C320 Phoenix, AZ 85004  602.496.2009 chir@asu.edu | chir.asu.edu SCOPE OF WORK Background To combat Arizonas opioid epidemic, the Arizona State Opioid Response (SOR) Data Project team leverages informatics, data science and clinical expertise to help combat the opioid epidemic. The project goal is to:   Develop models of opioid use disorder (OUD) and medication assisted treatment (MAT) to assist policymakers to identify, monitor and close resource gaps and deliver actionable timely data to individuals to reduce opioid overdoses and deaths.  The Center for Health Information & Research (CHiR) and a team from Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering collaborated on this project to accomplish the tasks described in the original Intergovernmental Service Agreement with ASU. CHiR Results from SOR I Data Modeling We created the Pathways to Addiction, a model that assigns risk probabilities to simulate OUD risk modification, overdose and opioid related deaths in Arizonas population. The two-component (agent-based and systems dynamics) model provides predictions on Arizona overdoses, overdose deaths, prescription to addiction conversions, addiction treatment workflow and information about remission cycles. The model was developed to investigate broad trends in prescription opioid addiction. To date, simulation runs have been completed using national-level rates (from peer-reviewed literature). The model considers the interactions between overdose, intervention, recovery and relapse. We have added details to the Pathways to Addiction and incorporated data visualizations and reporting.  Mobile Application The mobile app prototype, AZMap, has been designed for web, android and iOS systems to link individuals to the nearest MAT centers and permit first responders to access functional maps and monitor incidences in real time to assist with timely, targeted services. We have completed the application prototype and documentation. Other The results of our work have been presented at quarterly update meetings with AHCCCS. CHiR has also presented our work at several events, including the ASU College of Health Solutions Seminar Series, ASU Opioid Symposium, and the Phoenix Data Symposium.  SOR II Implementation Aims The objective of SOR Phase II is to evaluate the impact of various interventions to reduce the prevalence of OUD and opioid-related opioid deaths (OOD). Our approach is to map treatment cycles within the addiction cycles and expand the analysis of interventions that reduce the prevalence to OUD and OOD.   Project Tasks Task 1: The Pathways to Addiction Model developed during SOR I will continue to be refined. Outcomes from the current modeling will be analyzed and reported; mapping of the treatment cycle to the addiction cycle and addition of long-term treatment 2 intervention use cases will be developed. A modeling program will be delivered with the ability to manipulate the parameters for various scenarios to predict the impact of interventions and policy changes.   Task 2: An analysis of opioid addiction pre-COVID-19 versus post-COVID-19 will be conducted to determine population and system impacts: (1) the likelihood of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) to be diagnosed with COVID-19 and (2) the likelihood of those with OUD in an inpatient facility to be diagnosed with COVID-19.  Task 3: Substance use disorder outcomes of interest to AHCCCS will be analyzed and enhanced as relevant data are available (i.e., telehealth, integrated clinics, etc.).  CHiR will revise its Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol as needed for the above tasks. This may also require re-review/approval from ADHS.  Data Sources The specific data to be used in this study will include the following:   Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) health data.  AHCCCS is the state Medicaid provider. The data include enrollment and eligibility data and health care transactions (paid claims) on all members, patients receiving inpatient, emergency department, or other outpatient care in the state. The data layout is already at the individual patient level when received by CHiR and requires no further manipulation to standardize variables or match patients.   Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) death certificate data. ADHS provides all the death certificate data from its Office of Vital Records to CHiR annually.   Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP's) data. HCUPs includes the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States. The HCUP database contains information on inpatient stays, emergency department visits, and ambulatory care.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC provides opioid overdose data  resources at the county level. Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Census. From these sources, we will utilize the population denominators and other definitions and parameters. Deliverables CHiR will deliver a model that will assist AHCCCS in evaluating interventions for policy analytics and predict the potential impact of interventions. An executable program that allows for exploration of the Pathways to Addiction model will also be delivered. This software will allow parameters to be altered to answer what if scenarios and to evaluate the impact of policy. Summary analyses from the other tasks will also be provided. The deliverables will be securely provided to AHCCCS via electronic transmission. 3 ",

FP00026555,410,,,,,1,,,"The adverse effects of sugars have long been implicated as risk factors for cardiovascular disease, type 2 2 diabetes and cancer; yet, findings from epidemiologic studies have been inconclusive due to measurement errors 3 in self-reported sugars estimates. Twenty-four-hour urinary sucrose and fructose is currently being investigated 4 in the US under controlled feeding conditions as a biomarker for total sugars intake (U01-CA197902; PI 5 Tasevska). While a valid measure of total sugars intake, this biomarker does not distinguish between naturally-6 occurring (NOS) and added sugars (AS). AS are associated with poor diet quality, and may have more 7 pronounced adverse metabolic effects, as they are readily available to enter host metabolic pathways. On the 8 other hand, whole food sources of NOS, such as fruits, are high in fiber, micronutrients, and bioactive 9 compounds, and have been commonly associated with a lower burden of disease, making the need to 10 differentiate between the two even more compelling. Metabolomics, which simultaneously detects alterations in 11 hundreds of metabolites, promises novel avenues for discovering combinations of biomarkers, i.e., metabolomic 12 profiles, that can capture the complexity of diet. The aim of this proposal is to identify candidate metabolomic 13 profiles of diets high in AS and fruits (as major sources of NOS). We propose a highly controlled randomized 14 cross-over dose-response feeding study involving 12 men and women consuming diets of equal amounts of total 15 sugars that differ by food source of sugars over three 6-d dietary periods: 1) no AS - high fruit NOS, 2) medium 16 AS - medium fruit NOS, and 3) high AS - no fruit NOS diets. During each dietary period, participants will collect 17 three 24-h urines, and provide three fasting blood samples. We will use state-of-the-art untargeted metabolomic 18 profiling methods and platforms to measure >2,500 MS signals of aqueous metabolites and lipids that can be 19 reliably detected in human biofluids. First, we will use unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and 20 supervised partial least square (PLS) regression to identify urine and blood candidate profiles specific of diets 21 high in AS or in fruit NOS. Second, we will investigate the reproducibility of the identified urine and serum 22 candidate metabolomic profiles, and their dependence on covariates. Third, we will explore approaches for 23 combining urine and blood candidate metabolomic profiles to generate an improved integrated measure of 24 intake. The unique design of the study will allow simultaneous development of metabolomic profiles for two key 25 dietary components (AS and fruits) for which quantitative dietary guidelines have been set by the USDA. 26 Following successful completion of this work, we will propose to validate the metabolomic profiles of these 27 two important exposures under usual diet and free-living conditions and develop protocols for their applications 28 in the field. An unbiased measure of AS consumption is key for reliably assessing the role of AS in chronic 29 disease risk and for evaluating the impact of public health initiatives for reducing AS intake in the US population.",
FP00026576,411,,,,,1,,,"About 1 in 8 U.S. adults under the age of 65 have a physical disability that impairs mobility. People with mobility impairments (PMI) have been differentially burdened with higher risk of contracting COVID-19 because of difficulties implementing personal protection measures and challenges maintaining social distancing because of personal and healthcare needs. If infected, PMI risk developing severe disease due to underlying health conditions and barriers to accessing healthcare. There has been no effort to measure or support COVID-19 diagnostic services (testing, follow-up care, vaccine preparedness) in this population. These health and information disparities impede allocation of the resources and establishment of best practices required to address the needs of PMI during COVID-19.  There is a pressing need to transform society by measuring, understanding, and promoting equitable access to COVID-19 diagnostic services for PMI by conducting use-inspired research and engaging the affected community as active participants in the process to engage globally with a diverse, national sample, consistent with ASU design aspirations. In partnership with our current nationally representative community advisory board (CAB) made up of PMI, and our established web (https://feastresearch.weebly.com/) and social media presence, our goal is to understand, guide, and promote COVID-19 diagnostic best practices services. Our work will follow an established national cohort of 500 women and men with mobility impairing disabilities. Our participants will complete surveys online using state-of-the-science secure website. We have developed, tested, and implemented one round of a survey that includes measures of perceived COVID-10 threat, impacts, and experiences, use of COVID-19 diagnostic services, COVID-19 symptoms and recovery, perceived risk of self and family/household members, interaction with providers and vaccination preparedness. With a follow-up survey we will examine how COVID-19 experiences and perceptions of PMI change as the pandemic and our national response evolve. We will use results from our surveys to create and deploy a knowledge translation (KT) plan to accelerate adoption of evidence-based policy and practices in serving this vulnerable segment of our community. We will develop easy-to-use, adaptable, and scalable materials including educational information for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers as well as PMI and their care-providers. We will deploy information through our website and our social media outlets. Focusing on diagnostic services, we will produce best-practices guidelines for health professionals and personal assistants to use in standardizing care, providing guidance, and assisting in decision-making. Materials will be available in English and Spanish to enhance community reach. We will evaluate uptake of KT products from our website and monitor requests for support, such as presentations of this work for organizations supporting caregivers and personal assistants, clinical providers, and government agencies.This award will leverage our current work to identify key facilitators of, and barriers to, obtaining COVID-19 diagnostic services (testing, follow-up care, vaccine preparedness) among PMI over time.

FP00026613,414,,,,,1,,,"We will develop an internship that combines hands-on health research experiences and speculative fiction writing mentorship to encourage underrepresented high school students to reimagine the future of health careers.  (29 words)    Students from underrepresented populations contemplating careers in STEM fields are often challenged by the scarcity of role models and personal contexts for these future careers. They are less likely to have STEM professionals as family members or access to such professionals in their communities. Fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King encouraged Nichelle Nichols to remain on Star Trek as Lieutenant Uhura despite the discrimination and diminished roles she encountered on set, arguing that young people of color needed to see someone who looked like them participating in the shows optimistic vision of the future. Today, there are still far too few people of color in high-profile roles as STEM practitioners in popular culture. And yet it is precisely in those science fictional futures where we most need to foster diversity and access: a sense of inclusive, collective possibility around the future of STEM.   We address this challenge by creating a hybrid science-and-storytelling internship program in which underrepresented high school students work with researchers on improving health outcomes in underserved communities. What distinguishes this proposal is our plan to mentor students not just in conducting health research, but also in creating their own science fiction stories about the future of health, grounded in cutting-edge knowledge and inquiry. By supporting students in writing fiction based on their internshipstories in which they appear as a characterwe hope to give these young people both knowledge-building and imagination-building tools for reaching their career ambitions.   Over the course of the project, students will work 15-20 hours per week for 8 weeks with faculty who are conducting health research. For example, Dr. Dorothy Sears is working on reducing the incidence of diabetes among Latinx mothers through changes in their meal times, and Dr. Vega Lopez is working on improving Latinx childrens nutrition and obesity prevention through parent and student training. Students will attend lab meetings, collect and analyze data, and collaborate on manuscripts. In addition, students will work with a writing mentor to draw on their internship experience to envision a future for that field (and their place in it) in the form of a science fiction story, and develop skills in imagining, writing, and editing compelling narratives. At the end of the experience, we will host a symposium where students will share their stories. The stories will be combined to create an anthology, distributing print copies to participants and their school libraries while also making a free online version.  This project utilizes the methods that the Center for Science and the Imagination has developed across projects funded by NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the World Bank to foster imagination and leverage fiction as a tool for strengthening agency. We will partner with the College of Health Solutions to identify faculty mentors, and David Bowles, a Mexican American author, will serve as the writing mentor. David is a particularly good fit, as he teaches adolescent literature and researches the impact of culturally responsive speculative fiction on the literacy of Latinx teens.  (498 words) ",
FP00026638,415,,,,,1,,,"Background As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, there has been a consistent need to track the emerging evidence-base for effective strategies to control the spread of COVID-19 in Maricopa County. In some cases, this has meant purposefully looking through published studies and case reports from elsewhere, and determining the extent to which strategies used elsewhere might work to solve identified needs in Maricopa County. In some cases, this has meant monitoring selected sources of high-quality scientific literature in order to stay informed on potential looming disease control challenges or solutions. Based on the funding profile awarded in the existing Intergovernmental Service Agreement between Maricopa County and ASU Dr. McCullough was able to work 50% FTE from May 2020 through July 2020. This allowed him to devote substantial time to actively monitoring the scholarly evidence-base and to respond to emerging public health priorities. But for the period of August 2020 to January 2020 the agreement requires that he reduce his effort to about 4.5% FTE which does not allow for additional tasks such as the ones needed for this COVID-19 study. Scope of Work The goal of this request is to ensure continued, real-time capacity for timely responses to emerging public health priorities. This would be accomplished through three main areas of work: 1.  Routine reviews of newly-published high-impact COVID-19 findings in the scientific literature.  2.  Continued availability to respond to requests for evidence/literature reviews on emerging topics  3.  Statistical analyses of mutually-agreeable topics related to the COVID-19 burden of disease in Maricopa County Resources Requested A total of $30,791 is respectfully requested to undertake the scope of work detailed above. This represents an additional 20% FTE of Dr. McCulloughs effort during the period September 1  December 31, 2020 (exclusive of the 4.5% existing FTE effort referenced above). McCullough will also supervise two individuals who will support all aspects of the scope of work detailed above. Matthew Speer, a faculty research associate at ASU, has substantial experience with real-time scholarly literature reviews and timely, critical assessments of the evidence-base for public health strategies. Speer will devote 30% FTE to this work during the project period. Additionally, a masters-level student will join the team to support McCullough and Speer in all aspects of the project at a 25% FTE workload during the project period. Together these three positions will ensure that all members of the project team are working at the top of their license in identifying, reviewing, and summarizing the emerging evidence base on controlling the spread of COVID-19 for residents of Maricopa County.

FP00026640,418,,,,,1,,,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are at risk for a range of significant communication problems. Dysarthria affects approximately 50% of the population and has well-documented detrimental effects on speech intelligibility, with the articulatory subsystem being the single largest contributor to speech intelligibility deficits. Our NIH-supported research has generated perhaps the largest and most fully characterized speech database in the world of children who have CP and their typical peers. This work has resulted in the first published growth curves for speech intelligibility, and the ability to predict longer term outcomes from early speech production features. Results have materially advanced our ability to make evidence-based recommendations for general treatment directions. Yet, the remaining challenge is to develop precision interventions for these children that can effectively improve speech intelligibility in the unique context of dysarthria and individual child-level patterns of growth and development. In this research we will leverage our large speech database and recent technological advancements in automatic speech recognition technology that allow for fine-grained continuous measures of articulatory precision at the level of the individual phoneme, as indicated by a probabilistic log likelihood ratio between the acoustic features of child-produced target phonemes and adult-produced target phonemes. We will refine an automated, objective speech assessment tool that is based on deep-learning of an acoustic model for every phoneme in context, and use this tool to develop benchmarks for articulatory precision by age. This research will test and validate our novel speech precision tool and its output metric on a large sample of typically developing children and children with cerebral palsy (CP). The aims of the proposed research will 1) quantify how articulatory precision in typically developing children grows from age 3 to age 10, develop reference growth curves for overall articulatory precision and for individual phonemes, and use the developmental trajectories to show when particular phonemes improve most rapidly; 2) quantify how articulatory precision at the phoneme level affects speech intelligibility, examining how overall precision affects intelligibility and which specific phonemes (or classes of phonemes) contribute the most intelligibility; and 3) characterize the development of articulatory precision and intelligibility in a longitudinal sample of children with cerebral palsy. These contributions are significant because age-level benchmarks for articulatory precision can be used for identification of speech disorders and for fine-grained measurement of treatment progress for clinical populations. Clarifying the impact of articulation precision in individual phonemes on speech intelligibility also allow precision interventions to improve intelligibility for a given child. Results will have broad application to other populations of children with speech disorders (e.g., childhood apraxia of speech, deaf speech, and cleft palate speech)",

FP00026652,420,,,,,1,,,"The health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic urges for rapid actions to treat affected individuals. To fight this emerging and novel infectious disease, the fastest way is to screen and repurpose commercialized drugs with potent antiviral activities. However, one important caveat is that many of these drugs are orally or intravenously administered, which causes them to be either inactivated in the gastrointestinal tract or metabolized in the liver and other tissues. As a consequence of this, only a small fraction of these compounds remains active and, even though some active drugs may finally reach the respiratory system, they represent less than 22% of the administrated doses 1. Moreover, these limited amounts of drugs have no target specificity for infected cells, further reducing their efficacy. Therefore, there is a critical need to improve the administration routes of compounds that have shown beneficial effects in the treatment of COVID-19 to increase their delivery specificity, bioavailability and bioactivity, which will consequently increase their therapeutic efficacy.Our goal is to find a rapid and effective way to treat COVID-19 patients. Our overall objective in this application is to develop an approach to deliver antiviral drugs in a safe, targeted and localized manner to airway epithelial cells of COVID-19 victims. Our central hypothesis is that encapsulating drugs in biocompatible and biodegradable nanoliposomes (NLPs) targeted to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells in the lung will increase the antiviral efficacy of these drugs and improve treatment outcomes for COVID-19-affected individuals. In particular, we plan to encapsulate two types of compounds: (1) a natural phospholipase A2 inhibitor (epigallocatechin gallate: EGCG) to limit the ability of the virus to remodel cellular membranes and lipid metabolism for the generation of new virus particles; and (2) two nucleotide analogs, Remdesivir and Favipiravir, which have shown promise against influenza viruses, flaviviruses, Ebola, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This approach will enhance the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs, their bioavailability and decrease their side effects and toxicity, while bringing us closer to winning the fight against SARS-CoV-2. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following aims:Aim 1: Synthesize ACE2-targeted drug-loaded NLPs and determine their characteristics and target specificity. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cellular receptor to enter in lung epithelial cells. Hence, our working hypothesis is that by engineering NLPs targeting ACE2-expressing cells, we will specifically deliver EGCG, Remdesivir and Favipiravir to cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. To target the ACE2 receptor, we will anchor on the NLP membrane a new linear ACE2-targeting peptide with valine and tyrosine groups at the C-terminus (CGGDRVYVY), which have demonstrated high binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. We will characterize the NLPs solubility, stability and physicochemical properties as well as their targeted delivery efficiency. For this, we will measure intracellular concentrations of EGCG, Remdesivir and Favipiravir. In addition, the NLPs will encapsulate rhodamine, so we can confirm NLP binding and uptake by target cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target the ACE2 receptor for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents for combating COVID-19.Aim 2: Determine the efficacy of ACE2-targeted and drug-loaded NLPs at blocking SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Our working hypothesis is that the targeted delivery of nucleotide analogs and EGCG to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells will halt the propagation of the virus by intersecting with genome replication and virion assembly. We will test this hypothesis by measuring the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies as well as virion production in human airway epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with drug-loaded NLPs, void NLPs or free drugs. We expect that the targeted delivery of drugs via NLPs will lead to a significant defect in virus genome replication and assembly site architecture, consequently limiting virion production.Through the targeted delivery of NLPs loaded with antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 we will increase the bioavailability and bioactivity of these compounds, increasing their therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the use of an ACE2-specific peptide to deliver our NLPs to SARS-CoV-2 target cells will competitively block the virus ability to interact with this receptor, limiting virus entry. Therefore, administration of these drug-loaded NLPs will halt virus propagation, tissue damage and improve the prognostics of affected individuals.",
FP00026656,421,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY Motor rehabilitation is commonly recommended for managing functional limitations in aging adults with and without neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsons disease (PD). The clinical reality is, however, that some patients show sizeable improvements in function while others are less responsive to therapy. The long-term goal is to develop tools to help clinicians better predict a patients responsiveness to the type of motor rehabilitation they plan on prescribing, thereby adapting and personalizing a patients overall care plan accordingly. Previous work suggests that cognitive assessment could be such a tool, as cognitive status has been shown to predict learning of functionally-relevant motor tasks. However, cognitive status has been largely ignored in motor rehabilitation trials and is not typically evaluated; thus, the extent to which it can consistently explain individual differences in motor learning across a range of patient groups is still unknown. The overall objective of this proposal is to test whether baseline cognition predicts motor learning across different effectors (upper and lower extremity) and task types (voluntary and reactive) in different groups (typical aging and PD) to better capture clinical reality. The central hypothesis is that global cognitive status will predict motor learning in both groups; however, based on previous data, these predictors may vary across effectors and task type. The stated goals will be achieved through two aims. Aim 1 will test whether global cognitive status predicts responsiveness to training across effectors and task types in older adults with no neurologic diagnosis. Aim 2 will test whether global cognitive status predicts responsiveness to training across effectors and task types in older adults with PD. We will conduct a crossover design study for each Aim in which participants receive four treatments of motor training across two types of tasks (voluntary and reactive) with two different effectors (upper and lower extremity). We hypothesize that regardless of effector and task type, learning will be related to cognitive function even after controlling for baseline motor performance and age. Secondary analyses will be performed to compare the relative strengths of specific cognitive domains (e.g., visuospatial construction, executive function) as predictors for different effectors and task types. Based on pilot work in PD, we hypothesize that although baseline cognitive scores and motor performance will be lower in this sample compared to the participants in Aim 1, the same cognitive relationships will persist in adults with PD. Through this project, we will systematically and more rigorously test the effect of cognition on the learning of multiple tasks that are clinically relevant and functionally meaningful in both normal aging and PD populations. By testing hypotheses with validated, standardized, and easy-to-administer cognitive assessments, findings from this proposal have the potential to immediately impact the field of motor rehabilitation in ways that more cost- and time-intensive predictors of responsiveness cannot.

Although discharging landfill leachate to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) is the preferred method of disposal, landfill operators are facing increasing scrutiny. One of the main problems is that leachate organic matter (i.e., recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon, DOC) can interfere with UV disinfection at POTWs. For example, < 1% leachate in wastewater can reduce UV transmittance for disinfection to below the minimum of 65%. A problem in some areas of the US is the presence of emerging contaminants in leachate, in particular, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). A variety of possible adverse health effects of PFAS, associated with water resources have been identified.     Accordingly, the overall goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of ion exchange treatment to remove recalcitrant DOC (i.e., UV quenching substances) and PFAS (specifically, perfluoroalkyl acids, PFAA) from landfill leachate. The vision for this project is a two-stage ion exchange process whereby DOC removal takes place first followed by PFAS removal thereby allowing leachate to be discharged to POTWs with minimal impacts. The specific objectives of this project are to: 1.  Evaluate the long-term performance of biological ion exchange for removal of UV quenching substances from landfill leachate; 2.  Evaluate the impact of leachate organic matter concentration on the removal of select PFAA from landfill leachate by non-regenerable and regenerable anion exchange resin; and 3.  Conduct a preliminary cost-benefit analysis of leachate treatment by ion exchange using the results from objectives 1 and 2.  Description of the Research Approach & Experimental Design The overall concept being tested is the removal of recalcitrant DOC and PFAS from landfill leachate by ion exchangespecifically, using anion exchange resin (AER) to adsorb negatively charged UV quenching substances and negatively charged PFAAs such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The approach uses biologically enhanced ion exchange and non-regenerable AER for PFAA removal. If proven effective, this may result in a relatively simple process for treatment of landfill leachate to address the concerns facing the solid waste industry.

Total Budget: Project Duration:  Project Objectives Leachate generation is one of the main consequences of landfilling municipal solid waste. Although discharging landfill leachate to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) is the preferred method of disposal, landfill operators are facing increasing scrutiny. One of the main problems is that leachate organic matter (i.e., recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon, rDOC) can interfere with UV disinfection at POTWs. For example, just 0.01% leachate in wastewater can reduce UV transmittance (UVT) for disinfection to below the minimum of 65% (Reinhart 2017). A growing problem in some areas of the US is the presence of emerging contaminants in leachate, in particular, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (Lang et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2017). A variety of possible adverse health effects of PFAS, associated with water resources have been identified.    EREF has funded several projects on leachate treatment. Of relevance to this proposal are Polymer-Based Pre-Treatment for Removal of PFAS from Landfill Leachate by Geosyntec and Approaches to Mitigation of Landfill Leachate-Induced UV Transmittance Impacts by Montclair State University (MSU) that investigated coagulation, activated carbon adsorption, and chemical oxidation (Deng et al. 2018b). The Geosyntec project was recently awarded and does not include rDOC. The MSU project was able to increase the UV transmittance of leachate but not above the minimum of 65%; also, emerging contaminants such as PFAS were not investigated. A promising treatment for leachate is ion exchange, which can remove more rDOC from landfill leachate than coagulation (Boyer et al. 2011). It also has been concluded to more effectively remove PFAS from groundwater than granular activated carbon (Woodard et al. 2017).   Accordingly, the overall goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of ion exchange treatment to remove rDOC and PFAS from landfill leachate. The vision for this project is a two-stage ion exchange process whereby rDOC removal takes place first followed by PFAS removal. The specific objectives of this project are to: 1.  Evaluate the long-term performance of biological ion exchange for removal of rDOC from leachate; 2.  Evaluate the impact of rDOC on the removal of PFAS from leachate by non-regenerable ion exchange resin; and  1 3.  Conduct a preliminary cost-benefit analysis using the results from objectives 1 and 2 After considering selective contaminant removal by AER, the next consideration Description of Proposed Activity and Scope of Work  The overall concept being tested is the removal of rDOC and PFAS from landfill leachate by ion exchangespecifically, using anion exchange resin (AER) to adsorb negatively charged UV quenching substances and negatively charged PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). AER are polymer beads that possess positively charged functional groups that in turn attract negatively charged chemicals through electrostatic interactions. AER are not all the same; the properties of AER can be altered to obtain selectivity for different chemicals, e.g., perchlorate (Hu et al. 2016), pharmaceuticals (Landry and Boyer 2013), DOC (Graf et al. 2014), and PFAS (Zaggia et al. 2016). Hence, a two-stage ion exchange process could be implemented such that the first-stage AER is selective for UV quenching substances and the second-stage AER is selective for PFAA.  is regeneration. Traditional chemical regeneration uses a concentrated salt solution to desorb contaminants from the AER and allow the resin to be reused, but there can be high costs for regeneration chemicals and disposal of waste regeneration solution. Accordingly, objective 1 investigates the potential for biological ion exchange, i.e., biofilm formation on AER that promotes mineralization of sorbed constituents and thereby regenerates the AER (Aponte-Morales et al. 2018, Winter et al. 2018) to obviate the need for chemical regeneration while maintaining satisfactory removal of UV quenching substances, and objective 2 investigates the potential for non-regenerable AER to remove PFAS in the presence of leachate organic matter. A conceivable treatment approach to emerge from this project is biological ion exchange for selective removal of UV quenching substances followed by non-regenerable AER for selective removal of PFAS. The two-stage ion exchange process would be simple to operate and may have low operating costs due to no chemical regeneration requirements for either ion exchange process. The premise of low operating cost would be quantified by comparing the proposed ion exchange processes with ion exchange treatment based on chemical regeneration and other established leachate disposal options. Preliminary research on biological ion exchange for rDOC in surface water has been performed.  Review of Relevant Literature  management industry. This proposal complements and does not duplicate previous and current projects on leachate treatment. As mentioned above, the most relevant EREF project is Approaches to Mitigation of Landfill Leachate-Induced UV Transmittance Impacts (Deng et al. 2018b), which investigated the nature of UV quenching substances in landfill leachate and evaluated the effectiveness of physical-chemical processes to Previous and current projects funded by EREF and the solid waste  2 reduce UV absorbance in leachate. This proposal builds on the knowledge of UV quenching substances in leachate and investigates a new physical-chemical process that has not been previously investigated in EREF projects, namely ion exchange. For example, Development of a Strategy for the Treatment of Landfill Leachates (Virginia Tech) and Simultaneous Concentration and Treatment of Landfill Leachate by Hybrid Osmotically Driven Membrane Processes (Humboldt State University) evaluate various biological and physical-chemical processes for leachate treatment but overlook ion exchange. In addition, none of the projects mentioned on leachate treatment have considered co-treatment of UV quenching substances and PFAS.  Recent landfill leachate literature that form the basis for this proposal include  (Deng et al. 2018a, Deng et al. 2018b, Iskander et al. 2018, Reinhart 2017, Zhao et al. 2013), which characterize the nature of UV quenching substances in landfill leachate, treatment by select physical-chemical processes, and impact of leachate discharge on UVT in wastewater. Collectively, the research shows that UV quenching substances in landfill leachate are chemically similar to humic substances in natural aquatic environments, and that physical-chemical processes can achieve varying levels of UV removal. Earlier landfill leachate literature (Bashir et al. 2010, Boyer et al. 2011, Comstock et al. 2010) agree with the humic characterization of leachate organic matter and highlight the potential for ion exchange to reduce the UV absorbance of leachate. The parallels between leachate treatment and drinking water treatment literature are intriguing where ion exchange gained attention as an alternative to coagulation for removal of humic substances from drinking water supplies (Boyer 2015). Recently, ion exchange is also attracting attention as an alternative to granular activated carbon for removal of PFAS from contaminated water (Woodard et al. 2017). Hence, there is a gap in the leachate treatment literature on the performance of ion exchange processes for the removal of UV quenching substances and PFAS.      recalcitrant DOC and UV quenching substances are characterized by aromatic carbon domains and carboxylic acid functional groups (as a result, UV absorbance at 254 nm, UV254, is a common measurement). The carboxylic acid functional groups are ionized in natural water and landfill leachate giving DOC a negative charge and thereby can be removed from solution by stoichiometric exchange with mobile counterion on AER. DOC removal by ion exchange has been extensively studied for drinking water treatment with PI Boyer publishing 45 articles on the topic, and current interest in the topic still high (Levchuk et al. 2018). Key insights on the topic include the greater effectiveness of polyacrylic AER over polystyrene AER for DOC removal and the preferential removal of the UV absorbing fraction of DOC relative to the total pool of DOC. Two recent articles have demonstrated a novel application of ion exchange for DOC removal whereby the AER is not chemically regenerated and instead a biofilm is allowed to grow on the resin and partially regenerate the resin, i.e., biological ion exchange (Amini et al. 2018, Winter Removal of DOC by ion exchange. Whether in surface water or landfill leachate,  3 Removal of PFAS by ion exchange. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) are a major et al. 2018). Biological ion exchange has also been demonstrated for wastewater treatment (Aponte-Morales et al. 2018). The application of biological ion exchange for drinking water treatment is uncertain because it lacks the high and consistent DOC removals achieved by ion exchange with chemical regeneration. However, biological ion exchange appears to be uniquely appealing for leachate treatment in that a substantial reduction in UV254 can be achieved in a simple process.   class of PFAS that include carboxylic acid (e.g., PFOA) and sulfonic acid (PFOS) compounds. PFOA and PFOS are the most studied and regulated PFAS to date.  Certain states have established or are considering establishment of surface water criteria and/or drinking water protective levels for these two compounds.  This is also a growing push for regulation of land application of WWTP biosolids containing these and other PFAS.  The acid functional group give PFAA a negative change in natural water and landfill leachate that allows for favorable removal by ion exchange. Research on PFAA removal by ion exchange is a recent topic with approximately 15 publications spanning resin properties, PFAA selectivity, and regeneration efficiency. For example, several AERs including regenerable and non-regenerable resins have been identified for PFAA (Zaggia et al. 2016), and it has been determined that regenerable resins require a combination of salt solution and organic solvent to desorb the PFAA (Woodard et al. 2017). An underexplored topic is the influence of DOC on PFAA removal by ion exchange, which is important for natural water and critical for landfill leachate. Both DOC and PFAA include acid functional group attached to hydrophobic hydrocarbon, which results in dual interactions with the AER of electrostatic and van der Waals. As such, DOC is expected to compete with PFAA for sites on AER; however, the extent of competition is not known, especially for leachate organic matter. To address this gap in the literature, experiments are proposed that investigate PFAA removal by ion exchange at different background levels of leachate organic matter.     Research Tasks for Objective 1  for removal of UV quenching substances from stabilized landfill leachate, and the impact of ion exchange pretreatment on the UVT of leachatewastewater mixtures. The experiments will compare 2 different operating modes for ion exchange: (A) biological ion exchange filter (i.e., laboratory column containing AER without chemical regeneration), and (B) ion exchange filter (i.e., laboratory column containing AER with periodic chemical regeneration). The operating modes were selected to compare regenerationion exchange without and with chemical regeneration. Experiments will be conducted using DOC-selective AER, stabilized landfill leachate, and monitored for leachate organic matter characteristics (DOC, TN, and UV254) and inorganic ions. AER will be obtained from Purolite, which has agreed to provide in-kind support for resin Objective 1 will evaluate the long-term performance of biological ion exchange  4 Task 1A will investigate the performance of biological ion exchange filter to samples. Leachate will be obtained with assistance from Republic Services, which has agreed to provide in-kind support for recovery of leachate samples and technical review of research plans. Select leachate samples following? ion exchange treatment will be mixed at different volume fractions with clarified wastewater to evaluate the impact of leachate pretreatment on UVT in leachatewastewater mixtures.     remove UV quenching substances from landfill leachate. Purolite A850 AER will be used for DOC removal because its polyacrylic composition is favorable for DOC removal but unfavorable for organic chemicals like PFAA. The AER will be loaded into two glass columns so that the process can be evaluated in duplicate. Leachate will be pumped downflow through the column at a flow rate corresponding to an empty bed contact time of 30 min (equivalent to 2 bed volumes per hour, BV/h). This is a longer contact time than typically used for ion exchange and was selected to minimize clogging of the filter and promote biofilm formation (Amini et al. 2018, Winter et al. 2018). Importantly, the AER will not be regenerated. Based on the limited previous research on biological ion exchange (Winter et al. 2018), we expect to run the experiment for 1 year and observe the following results. During the first few weeks of operation UV254 will be low with removal taking place by stoichiometric ion exchange. After 2 to 3 months of operation, UV254 will increase due to saturation of the AER with UV quenching substances. Around 4 months of operation, UV254 will stabilize between the previous conditions with UV254 removal occurring through a combination of ion exchange and biodegradation. Extensive sampling and chemical analysis of the leachate will be conducted to verify the expected results. At least two samples will be collected each week with sample collection separated by at least 2 days. Sampling will include both influent and effluent leachate. Samples will be refrigerated at 4C and analyzed bi-weekly for TOC, TN, DOC, UV254, and inorganic anions (see Analytical Methods subsection).   Task 1B will investigate the performance of traditional ion exchange filter to remove UV quenching substances from leachate. Task 1B will follow nearly identical setup and sampling as Task 1A including duplicate columns run for 1 year, with the key difference being periodic chemical regeneration. The AER will be regenerated bi-weekly using a 10% NaCl solution. The regeneration process will consist of pumping 5 to 10 bed volumes of NaCl solution through the column in downflow mode. The waste regeneration solution will be collected and analyzed along with the bi-weekly influent and effluent leachate samples. Based on previous research by the PI, the regeneration process will desorb UV substances from the AER and the regenerated AER is expected to give consistent and low UV254 throughout the study (Ness and Boyer 2017).  Task 1C will investigate the performance of suspended ion exchange to remove UV quenching substances from leachate. The physical setup of Task 1C will be nearly the same as Tasks 1A and 1B; the difference being leachate pumped upflow through the  5 Task 1C will evaluate the impact of leachate pretreatment on UVT in leachateObjective 2 will evaluate the impact of leachate organic matter on the removal of column to fluidize the AER bed. The empty bed contact time will be 5 min (12 BV/h), which is shorter than Tasks 1A and 1B because the fluidized bed has more effective mass transfer and is not impacted by turbidity and clogging. The regeneration frequency in Task 1C will correspond to the same number of bed volumes treated between regenerations as Task 1B, and 5 to 10 bed volumes of 10% NaCl solution will be used for regeneration. Task 1C will run for 2 months, which is equivalent to the same number of bed volumes treated in Task 1B over 12 months (i.e., 2 BV/h in 1B and 12 BV/h in 1C).  wastewater mixtures. Task 1D will be conducted every 3 months using influent and effluent leachate samples from Tasks 1A and 1B. Leachate will be mixed with clarified wastewater (Mesa, AZ) to achieve volume fractions of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 20% (v/v). UV254 will be measured in leachatewastewater mixtures and used to calculate UVT. Research Tasks for Objective 2  PFAA from stabilized landfill leachate by non-regenerable AER. The selection of non-regenerable AER is to simplify the process; its implications on disposal cost will be evaluated in Objective 3. The experiments will evaluate leachate without and with AER pretreatment using leachate samples generated in Objective 1. Each leachate sample will be spiked with PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS, each at 1 g/L. PFOA and PFOS have health advisories issued by the EPA, and EPA recently released a draft toxicity assessment for PFBS that could be used to develop a health advisory. Inclusion of additional PFAA in objective 2 experiments will be considered based on current research and regulatory interest. The concentration of PFAS in landfill leachate is an active area of research (Allred et al. 2015, Gallen et al. 2017, Lang et al. 2017) with the concentrations selected for this proposal in-line with values reported in the literature. Analysis of PFAS is described in the Analytical Methods subsection. PFAS stock solutions for spiking and analysis will be prepared following standard methods (i.e., EPA Method 537). Experiments will be conducted using AER that have demonstrated effective removal of PFAS, namely Purolite PFA694E non-regenerable AER. It should be emphasized that Objective 2 is exploratory in nature given the limited previous research on PFAS removal in landfill leachate. The focus on PFOS and PFOA will allow for comparisons with other PFAS treatment studies, and the inclusion of PFBS will provide results for short-chain PFAA that can show different treatability than longer-chain PFAA.  Task 2A will evaluate PFAA removal in landfill leachate using non-regenerable AER, specifically Purolite PFA694E, which is marketed as a PFAS selective resin. Task 2A will be conducted in similar manner as Tasks 1A and 1B. Duplicate columns will be run for each level of leachate organic matter. The columns will be run for 20,000 bed volumes, which is demonstrated run time for PFAS removal from groundwater by ion exchange (Woodard et al. 2017). Leachate will be pumped downflow through the column at empty bed contact time of 5 min (12 BV/h). Each column run (corresponding to each  6 Task 2B will evaluate PFAA removal in undiluted landfill leachate using Objective 3 (also referred to as Task 3) will conduct a preliminary cost-benefit concentration of leachate organic matter) will run for 70 days (i.e., 20,000 bed volumes) with the entire task requiring 236 days assuming 2 weeks downtime between runs. Importantly, the AER will not be regenerated. At least two samples will be collected each week with sample collection separated by at least 2 days. Sampling will include both influent and effluent leachate. Samples will be refrigerated at 4C and analyzed bi-weekly for UV254 and PFAA (see Analytical Methods subsection).    regenerable AER, Purolite A520E, which has shown effective removal of PFAS and effective regeneration by saltsolvent mixture (Woodard et al. 2017, Zaggia et al. 2016). Task 2B will be conducted in similar manner as Task 2a with the important difference being chemical regeneration. Duplicate AER columns will be run for 20,000 bed volumes (same as Task 2A) and then regenerated using 10 BV of 5% KCl in equal volume saltmethanol solution. The regenerated AER columns will be used to treat a subsequent 20,000 BV of undiluted leachate giving a second service cycle. The AER will be regenerated a second time and run for a third service cycle. Task 2B will follow the same sampling and analysis as Task 2A. Research Tasks for Objective 3  analysis considering the performance results from objectives 1 and 2, and the main capital costs and operating costs per gallon of leachate treated for removal of UV quenching substances only, PFAA only, and UV quenching substances and PFAA. The table below illustrates the key parameters that will be considered for the cost analysis. Geosyntec Consultants has provided a letter of support and will be engaged in the cost analysis task. Briefly, ion exchange processes that do not require regeneration (Tasks 1A and 2A) have the simplest equipment requirements and lowest energy requirements because the only need is to pump leachate downflow through ion exchange filter. Ion exchange with chemical regeneration (Tasks 1B, 1C, and 2B) requires additional vessels and pumps for the regeneration solution, chemical inputs, and waste regeneration solution that must be disposed of. Removal of PFAA by ion exchange ultimately generates a PFAA-laden waste that must be disposed of by incineration. A critical component not captured in the table below that will be considered in the cost analysis, is the performance of the ion exchange processes to remove UV quenching substances and/or PFAA. Hence, the ultimate deliverable from objective 3 will be the cost for different ion exchange processes to achieve different goals and levels of leachate treatment.

Briefly, our targeted LC-MS/MS method to  Analytical Methods  laboratory, which is equipped with Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon analyzer with Total Nitrogen module and autosampler, Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and Dionex ICS-5000 ion chromatograph. PI Boyers laboratory contains all necessary equipment and materials for conducting the ion exchange treatment experiments described in this proposal as demonstrated by his publication record.  measure PFAA is based on the EPA Method 537 (Shoemaker et al. 2008). We are highly experienced in quantitative measurements and targeted LC-MS/MS detection (Gu et al. 2016, Gu et al. 2015); for example, our pathway-specific targeted method was developed for the detection of over 300 metabolites from >35 different metabolic pathways of strong biological significance. In this study, all LC-MS/MS experiments will be performed on an Agilent 1290 UPLC-6490 QQQ-MS system. We will optimize the LC-MS/MS system using PFAA standards, and important parameters mainly include precursor ion, product ion, collision voltage, and retention times. For study samples, targeted data acquisition will be performed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring mode, due to significant advantages of great selectivity and excellent quantitation. Samples will be concentrated using solid phase extraction (SDVB phase), and they will be run with a set of internal or external standards such that we can determine absolute concentrations of the selected PFAA. A set of quality control samples will be prepared and measured once every 10 study samples. Notably, we will characterize and optimize our LC-MS/MS method to obtain the best limit of detection, limit of quantitation, precision, accuracy, recovery rate, and reproducibility. Benefits to the Solid Waste Management Industry  The outcomes of this project will benefit the solid waste management industry by evaluating new technological approaches for leachate treatment that address emerging challenges in the industry, namely the possible adverse impact of leachate discharge on POTWs (i.e., reduced UVT) and the increasing attention of PFAS contamination of water resources and sources of contamination. The basis for the technology approach is ion exchange, which is an underexplored process in leachate treatment as documented in the Review of Relevant Literature subsection. Of practical importance, however, is that ion exchange is an established process in drinking water treatment especially for water supplies with elevated concentrations of DOC and UV absorbing substances. As such,  8 this project will generate a comprehensive data set on leachate treatment by ion exchange that includes removal of UV quenching substances and PFAA, and different process operating conditions. Furthermore, the experimental results will be used to estimate the cost per gallon of leachate treated for different ion exchange processes and for removal of DOC only, PFAS only, and DOC and PFAS.        Deliverables Expected deliverables for this project include process deliverables for the research team, new knowledge for the scientific community, knowledge translation for practitioners, and required project deliverables for EREF. Examples, although not exhaustive, include:   Process deliverables: experimental procedure for biological ion exchange, analytical method for PFAA analysis in landfill leachate;   New knowledge: original data sets on removal of UV quenching substances and removal of PFAA from landfill leachate by ion exchange;   Knowledge translation: cost analysis of leachate treatment by ion exchange, technical presentations, and fact sheets;   Required project deliverables: progress reports, technical reports, etc. Schedule with Milestones The schedule for the project is given in the table below with columns 29 corresponding to 3-month increments (e.g., Y1Q1 is the first 3 months of year 1). Solid blue cells indicate the major task during the time, and diagonal blue cells indicate the secondary task during the time. For example, the major focus of year 1 is comparison of biological ion exchange and ion exchange with chemical regeneration for removal of UV quenching substances from landfill leachate.

FP00026692,424,,,,,1,,,"Research is clear. Children who attend high-quality early childhood programs are less likely to be placed in special education, less likely to repeat a grade in school, and more likely to graduate from high school than their peers who do not attend high quality programs (McCoy et al., 2017). The first years of life are crucial for brain development when more than 1 million new neural connections are formed every second. A childs early experiences, including those formed in child care and preschool, affect the quality of brain architecture upon which future learning, health and behavior are established (Center on the Developing Child, 2007).Unfortunately, most families in Arizona cannot afford high-quality early childhood programs because there are so few of them. We can increase the quality of existing programs by providing high quality professional development training for administrators, teachers, and early care providers, but high quality professional development is difficult to access and afford, especially in rural areas of Arizona. Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is an innovative model for delivering high-quality professional development training. A core tenet of ECHO is to move knowledge, not people. ECHO projects can link expert specialist teams with early childhood professionals in local communities using telecommunications technology.The mission of the Arizona Early Childhood Professional Development ECHO is to make high-quality, high impact professional development training available to every early childhood professional in Arizona and to do it for free. Our planning team includes volunteers from early childhood agencies around the state, demonstrating our community social embeddedness (Arizona Association for the Education of Young Children, Arizona Department of Education, Arizona State Schools for the Deaf and Blind, First Things First, Southwest Human Development, Catholic Charities West Side Head Start, and Arizona State University). In this project, we will also complete a pilot study assessing training effectiveness for use in a subsequent federal funding application.   Our vision is to increase the impact of ECHO exponentially in the coming years. We will increase the number of training topics, the number of people we impact, and the likelihood that we can compete successfully for a research grant. To accomplish this, our approach is to seek funding from Women and Philanthropy for a half time ECHO coordinator who can help us administer three new ECHO state-wide trainings and coordinate data collection for the pilot study.",
FP00026694,425,,,,,1,,,"MissionOur mission is to dramatically increase the early identification of children with dyslexia, so that they receive intervention before they fail academically and experience negative social and emotional consequences. About 17% of people have dyslexia  a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding. Unfortunately, many children with dyslexia are not diagnosed until they have failed to learn to read. Poor identification rates are exacerbated in children who do not speak English as their first language because these children must learn English at the same time they are learning to read.VisionOur vision is that every pediatrician in the U.S. will give our validated dyslexia screener to parents at their childs 6-year-old well-check visit. Pediatricians routinely administer developmental screeners, so they are well positioned to add this screener to their practice. Results will be shared with parents to advise them whether to pursue acomprehensive developmental evaluation. Thus, our project leverages an existing healthcare system to increase early identification of dyslexia, which will lead to an increase in health equity and access to appropriate screening and intervention.In addition to addressing the College of Health Solutions Grand Challenge, this project aligns with two ASU Design Aspirations. We are conducting use-inspired research directly addressing a community-based problem and the project is socially-embedded, leveraging a Phoenix Childrens Hospital  ASU partnership. Research will becompleted in the community to benefit the lives of Latino children and their families.ApproachWe will recruit 100 six year olds: 50 at risk for dyslexia based on familial and educational performance and 50 with no identified risk for dyslexia or other developmental disorder. Families will be recruited through the Phoenix Children Hospital Pediatrician Network and local school districts, where whole-classroom screening (an experimental measure, not used currently in schools) will identify children at risk for dyslexia. Parents will complete the dyslexia screening questionnaire. Next their children will complete a comprehensive developmental assessment (gold standard testing) to identify whether the child has dyslexia. This battery includes measures of nonverbal IQ, oral language, real word and nonword decoding, and phonological awareness. Depending on the childs languageproficiency, measures may be administered in Spanish or English. Gold standard results will allow us to identify questions on the parent questionnaire highly predictive of dyslexia or no dyslexia. This information will be used to reduce the number of questions on the parent questionnaire to make it as efficient as possible. Promise and ImpactThe impacts of this study will be to (a) show the promise of this questionnaire for accurately identifying risk of dyslexia in young Spanish-speaking children; (b) provide research data supporting an application for funding to validate the screener in a larger regional population; and (c) for children identified at risk of dyslexia in this study,will be referred to receive early treatment that will benefit them the rest of their lives.",
FP00026725,426,,,,,1,,,"The potential of the avian influenza (AI) virus to evolve into a human influenza pandemic establishes it as one of the major emerging infections in global health surveillance. In recent years, there have been a number of unprecedented and concerning shifts in global AI epidemiology, which indicates there is now a greater need to evaluate AI pandemic emergence and risk. An unparalleled number of AI strains have emerged in the last decade compared to any time previously in history. Concurrent and ongoing outbreaks of AI in poultry have been reported in an increasing number of countries, in Asia, Africa, the Americas, Middle East and Europe. The likelihood of a major influenza pandemic occurring is increased given this unprecedented rise in AI outbreaks in birds around the world and the number of zoonotic AI serotypes. In addition, travel and globalization mean that infections arising in one country can spread rapidly around the globe, and therefore risk assessment, early epidemic detection and mitigation are important in reducing global risk. However, it is difficult to predict when and where the next pandemic strain will emerge let alone predict how the it will spread as there are a large number of factors which could contribute to an emergence. In this project, we will develop a novel risk assessment framework which integrates different types of methodologies and data for evaluating the emergence of human transmissible AI. Here, we will use Vietnam with the population of more than 95 million people, as a case study. While much of the attention regarding AI has been on China, Vietnam has historically been affected by many emerging infections, including the SARS epidemic of 2003 and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 avian influenza. It shares borders with China, Laos and Cambodia, also high-risk countries for emerging infections. We hypothesize that combining genetic and Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered (SIR) approaches for predicting AI pandemic risk will provide policymakers with a highly useful tool for identifying areas at risk of AI pandemic emergence and predicting how the virus will likely spread over time. Our specific aims are to: Develop serological, genetic and epidemiological datasets for AI H5N1 surveillance in Vietnam (Aim 1); Use these data as input into our models for assessing risk (Aim 2). Here, we will develop a risk modeling framework which utilizes phylogeography, spatial, and deterministic approaches; Develop a web portal and system architecture for our risk modeling framework and perform stakeholder engagement and evaluation (Aim 3). As part of this effort, we will conduct policy development workshops with Vietnamese officials during which we will have them evaluate our risk models for AI planning and surveillance at the population level. Our project is strengthened by collaboration with a major Vietnamese surveillance institute that enables us to build capacity and enhance infectious disease modeling in Vietnam.",

Here, we will develop a risk modeling framework which utilizes phylogeography, spatial, and deterministic approaches; Develop a web portal and system architecture for our risk modeling framework and perform stakeholder engagement and evaluation (Aim 3). As part of this effort, we will conduct policy development workshops with Vietnamese officials to evaluate our risk models for AI planning and surveillance at the population level. Our project is strengthened by collaboration with a major Vietnamese surveillance institute that enables usto build capacity and enhance infectious disease modeling in Vietnam.",
FP00026733,428,,,,,1,,,"To date, COVID-19 is the third leading cause of death in the United States. A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is our best hope to return to better health and normalcy, and the U.S. hopes to have and FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine by as early as the end of this year. However, vaccine availability does not equate to vaccine uptake. Recent polls have shown that people are reporting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy due to the rapid development of this vaccine, the politicization of public health and this vaccine, and vaccine safety concerns. Individuals must have a vested interest in vaccinating against COVID-19, increasing the likelihood that they will enact the life-saving and life-protecting behavior of seeking this vaccine when it becomes commercially available. Guided by the Vested Interest Theory, our research aims to create and test strategic health communication messages that will increase individuals acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine and their vested interest in vaccinating against this virus. We will conduct formative research qualitatively explore COVID-19 vaccine perspectives among individuals who vary on the vaccine acceptance spectrum, as determined by survey research. Specific categories of vaccine acceptors include unquestioning acceptor, cautious acceptor, hesitant, late or selective vaccinator, and refuser. Using these qualitative findings, we will create and test a series of messages to determine whether our strategic health communication messages increase individuals vested interests and intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19. Using an experimental design, we will expose participants in the experimental group to messages for their vaccine acceptor category (four possible conditions) and the control group to current COVID-19 vaccine messages created by pharmaceutical companies and public health entities. We will survey participants in the experimental and control conditions to assess potential message impacts on their COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and vested interests in vaccinating. These messages, created for mass media and interpersonal health communication may, in turn, reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake. The overall impact of increasing vaccine uptake is to more quickly achieve herd immunity against COVID-19.",
FP00026737,429,,,,,1,,,"This project seeks to examine childrens sensitivity to auditory input from the front and rear hemispheres on the horizontal plain. The directional characteristics of listening in children with normal hearing will be determined first followed by children with hearing loss using a hearing aid feature designed to optimize speech input while managing unwanted noise in the environment.   Participants will complete word recognition and non-word detection tasks while seated in an array of 6 loudspeakers located at 60o intervals.  The stimuli will be presented randomly from the six loudspeakers to simulate listening in a group or classroom setting. The objectives of this project are to: 1) map the spatial sensitivity of children with normal hearing to familiar and unfamiliar words, 2) map the spatial sensitivity of children with hearing loss for the same stimuli without amplification to determine whether or not they have formed preferences for auditory input from the front or rear hemispheres, and 3) compare the sensitivity of children with hearing loss to their peers with normal hearing while using omnidirectional amplification and amplification with noise management that includes voice activity detection.",
FP00026759,430,,,,,1,,,"Approximately 2.8 million individuals are diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) every year 1. For most, cognitive symptoms resolve, but a subgroup will experience persistent deficits in attention, memory, and executive function (EF)2,3. Individuals with multiple mTBIs are more likely to experience persistent deficits; however, these individuals are often excluded from studies4,5. Further, these associated deficits can significantly impact complex cognitive processes, including reading comprehension and recall6,7, which are critical for success in academic and most professional settings. While individuals often self-report reading deficits post-injury8,9, many neuropsychological tests are not sensitive to subtle cognitive deficits10 and involve testing in quiet settings. However, functional reading often takes place in cognitively challenging settings, such as rooms with ambient noise or conversations. Reading with auditory distraction requires additional attentional resources to inhibit interference and focus attention on the primary task of comprehension. Previous reading comprehension studies have assessed individuals with mTBI in quiet lab environments using predominantly behavioral measures. The proposed study will examine mTBI-related effects on reading comprehension and recall using behavioral and eye-tracking methodologies. Oculomotor data will provide a sensitive and robust way of examining moment-to-moment cognitive processes, including blink rate, which reflects cognitive effort11,12, regressions which index working memory failures, and fixation duration, which reflects lexical processing13. Our pilot data showed that oculomotor measures were more sensitive to subtle mTBI-associated cognitive deficits than behavioral measures alone; a finding consistent with other studies2,4,10. The proposed experiments will also directly assess the impact of auditory environmental distraction (e.g., conversations) on reading comprehension in controlled laboratory and naturalistic settings. Further, cognitive task performance and self-reported cognitive symptoms will be used to identify individuals at the greatest risk of reading comprehension deficits following one or more mTBIs. This funding will substantially strengthen the research environment of the university, allowing well-qualified students to conduct oculomotor research and collaborate with faculty and students at other universities and to present their research at state and national conferences.Specific Aim 1: Assess the effect of one or multiple mTBIs on reading comprehension and delayed recall through behavioral and oculomotor measures. Healthy controls and individuals with one or multiple mTBIs will read paragraphs and answer comprehension questions while their oculomotor behaviors are tracked. After a delay, they will be asked to recall details from the paragraphs. In addition to behavioral data (e.g., accuracy, reading time), oculomotor data (e.g., blink rate, fixation duration, regressions) will be used to assess the underlying processes impacted by mTBI during reading.Predictions: Based on our pilot data, individuals with mTBI are predicted to show differences in specific oculomotor behaviors, including decreased blinking, a sign of increased cognitive effort. Individuals with multiple mTBIs should show increased regressions and fixation durations compared to healthy controls reflecting working memory and lexical processing deficits.Specific Aim 2: Assess the compounding effects of auditory distraction on reading comprehension, delayed recall, and oculomotor behavior in individuals with one or multiple mTBIs. Healthy individuals and individuals with one or more mTBIs will read paragraphs and answer comprehension questions in two conditions: 1) a quiet environment and 2) a setting with auditory distraction. The distraction will be presented via headphones in a laboratory or naturalistic setting (e.g., cafeteria).Predictions: Given prior findings, it is predicted that auditory distraction will exacerbate any observed cognitive symptoms14,15. Under the most difficult reading conditions14,15, individuals with multiple mTBIs should show greater decline in reading comprehension and recall accuracy as well as a larger decrease in blink rate, increased regressions, and longer fixation duration relative to healthy controls.Specific Aim 3: Use attention, memory, and EF task performance and symptom information to identify individuals with mTBI at the greatest risk for reading comprehension and recall deficits. Successful reading comprehension and recall rely on memory, attention, and EF to integrate text meaning with background knowledge and make inferences16. Persistent mTBI-related deficits in these processes should be reflected in reading comprehension and recall impairments. Memory, attention, EF task performance, as well as self-reported cognitive symptoms and specific oculomotor patterns, will be used to predict reading comprehension accuracy and recall.Predictions: It is expected that lower performance on attention, memory, and EF tasks and more severe self-reported symptoms associated with multiple mTBIs will be significant predictors of lower reading comprehension accuracy, worse recall, and longer reading times, as well as differences in oculomotor patterns, particularly with auditory distraction. Additionally, attention and EF deficits are expected to predict reading comprehension accuracy while memory deficits are expected to predict delayed recall scores.",
FP00026825,431,,,,,1,,,"Speech prosody is important for our vocal communication and social interactions because it allows us to convey our emotions and intonations. It is known that patients with profound hearing loss who use cochlear implants (CIs) have significant deficits in not only the perception but also the production of vocal emotions and speech intonations. This is because CIs do not have enough spectro-termporal resolution to faithfully encode voice pitch cues (the primary cues to emotional and linguistic prosodies). Prosody miscommunication of CI users may have a long-term detrimental effect on their social-cognitive wellbeing that is closely related to their quality of life. However, not many studies have looked at improving prosody production of CI users.Current clinical practices using model-based imitations to improve prosody production may not work effectively for CI users who cannot perceive the pitch differences between model and imitated prosodies. As such, we propose a multisensory approach that makes use of the intact vision and tactile sensation of CI users to provide effective feedback of pitch contours for prosody production training. In our pilot studies, we have developed hardware and software to extract the fundamental frequency of speech production and generate a visual or vibrotactile display of pitch contours in real time. These computer systems will be used in the proposed work to train prosody production of prelingually deaf adolescent and young adult CI users. The efficacy of three prosody production training paradigms with audio-only, audio-visual, and audio-tactile feedback of pitch contours in improving the production and perception of vocal emotions and speech intonations will be determined (Aim 1), and the predictors for the benefit of each training paradigm in individual participants will be identified (Aim 2).We hypothesize that training with a real-time visual or vibrotactile display of pitch contours will lead to greater improvement in prosody production and perception than training with audio-only feedback. Also, CI users with later implantation, less CI experience, and less residual hearing may have lower baseline performance with audio-only input, and thus have more improvement when trained with multisensory feedback. The knowledge gained from this project will provide the evidence-base for the development of more effective intervention approaches with multisensory feedback to improving CI users production and perception of vocal emotions and speech intonations than current clinical practices. Better prosody communication will in turn benefit the social-cognitive wellbeing and quality of life for CI users. The computer-based training systems developed in this proposal will be ready for use both in the clinic and at home and thus be more accessible for CI users than traditional approaches that need frequent visits to the clinicians office.",

FP00027002,439,,,,,1,,,"The primary goal of this Avenir Award is to develop a cutting-edge paradigm for Dr. Edward Ofori to establish an independent research program examining genetic variants and studying the neurobiological changes that occur in adult and adolescent cannabis use disorder users. To meet these career goals the candidate has 4 specific objectives in the Avenir: 1) identify association between APOE variants and cannabis use disorders in adolescent and adult cannabis users with African and European ancestry; 2) establish a paradigm that identifies neuroimaging markers in regular cannabis users; 3) establish a paradigm to examine cognitive-motor changes within cannabis users; and 4) track adolescent and adult cannabis users over time. These objectives will open a new line of work that is different from the candidates previous background in the fields of neuroscience, aging, and multimodal neuroimaging and will be achieved through guided mentorship of substance use disorder experts, and applied genetic research experiences. The activities proposed for the Avenir will take place at Arizona State University and Banner Alzheimers Institute. All mentors are world-wide respected experts in the fields of substance use (Drs. Leischow/Daniulaityte/Meier), genetics (Dr. Reiman) and motor systems neuroscience and neuroimaging (Dr. Ofori) research. The necessary laboratories, equipment, and supplies and population are needed to complete the series of studies described in this proposal are available to the candidate. Research on the genetic and neurobiological factors contributing to differential rates of cannabis use and substance use disorders in particular racial and ethnic groups is limited. APOE is a neurogenetic marker of brain AB aggregation and hippocampal decline in young adults, has yet to be examined in cannabis users. However, knowledge of genetic effects on structural and functional changes of cognitive-motor circuits in regular cannabis users is lacking, specifically related to the substantia nigra, supplementary motor areas, and prefrontal cortices. Thus, the long term goal of the candidates research is to establish a paradigm to identify genetic risk factors and neuroimaging markers that can aid in the prediction of regular cannabis use to cannabis use disorders. The applicant has a custom handgrip task-based fMRI marker of the prefrontal cortices and supplementary motor areas that may provide information about short and long-term cannabis use. The candidate has previously shown with free-water imaging, an advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) technique, that free-water measures from the substantia nigra can predict longitudinal changes in cognitive and motor status in Parkinsons disease. The candidate will examine free-water imaging measures in substantia nigra, basal ganglia and other motor areas in regular adolescent and adult cannabis users. The candidate will also determine whether genetic markers are associated with fMRI and free-water imaging measures and predict longitudinal changes in cognitive- motor assessment. The proposed research addresses a significant gap in the literature and is the first to evaluate APOE effects on cannabis users with African and European ancestry.

FP00027045,441,,,,,1,,,"Context  We propose to create a week-long module that fits into our existing course, ASU101, and which focuses on STEM entrepreneurship.  ASU101 is a course required of all first-year students at Arizona State University.  The goal of this module is to orient all students to the Entrepreneurship + Innovation mindset, as well as plug students into existing comprehensive resources and opportunities in the E+I space commensurate to the scale of ASU.  While ASU has an impressive and demonstrated commitment to E+I, there still exists what we perceive to be an invisible barrier preventing more students from participating in E+I opportunities.  It is our goal to provide familiarity and ease of access to as many students as possible given the scope and scale of ASU as a top tier research university with over 106,000 students in immersion (on-campus) and digital (on-line) programs in 2020-2021.  A pilot module has been developed by the Health Entrepreneurship Accelerator Lab (HEALab) within the Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation (Edson College) at ASU, and deployed in their ASU101 courses over the last several years.  The HEALab is an initiative of the Edson College with the support of and in collaboration with the J. Orin Edson Entrepreneurship + Innovation Institute (Edson E+I) , the College of Health Solutions (CHS), and the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences (NCIAS).  In its 3rd year, we are now seeing students moving on from HEALab to participate in such activities as Edson E+Is venture development program, VentureDevils, and its competitive funding opportunities.  Through both exposure to the process and the development of peer groups that support one another through the process, as well as provision of material support and resources, students are more willing and more successful entrepreneurs and innovators.  Proposed Initiative  Debuting in 2007, ASU101 is a course requirement for all ASU students, with a singular goal: every first-year student is connected to a small group of students and an instructor who can teach them how to succeed in college and give them a sense of the intellectual excitement and rigor of ASU.  Some colleges use a course prefix other than ASU (i.e, NCIAS uses NEW101).  However, the goals for the course are consistent within and among all colleges at ASU.  ASU101 students and instructors discuss the essentials for academic and personal success, such as choosing a major, social diversity, study skills and university resources. The course uses a combination of multimedia presentations, writing exercises, and discussions both in class and online to introduce unique elements of ASU, such as sustainability and global engagement. It is a rigorous course that teaches the intellectual and research basis of student success strategies, with a flexible curriculum that allows each section to be tailored to the students needs.  Since its debut, themes relating to community-embeddedness have been layered on top of these learning goals, using active, hands-on, and problem-based learning.  This existing structure of ASU101 lends itself easily to the formation of teams around E+I, both for the completion of the proposed module, and for beyond the single semester in which ASU101 is completed.  In ASU101, class-size is intentionally small (24 or less), and students are placed in teams within the class to complete certain tasks and projects.   Since 2017, first-year students from the Edson College have participated in a health innovation project assignment as a part of the required ASU101 course, rotating through the HEALab for innovation training.   Over 1900 students have ideated innovative solutions to real health problems presented by university faculty and researchers.  Working in small groups over the course of one semester, students develop solutions to topics as diverse as childhood obesity, human trafficking and opioid addiction, using principles of evidence based practice, human-centered design, and divergent thinking.  Faculty provide feedback and mentoring throughout the semester, and the culminating project results in a health innovation exhibition where students pitch their ideas and compete for funding.  With this grant, this HEALab module will be expanded such that it can be incorporated into ASU101 in all colleges, and therefore in all disciplines, at ASU.  The guiding principle of the HEALab module, which is to solve a common problem using an uncommon approach, or the unconventional application of existing technology of tools, is easily applied outside of the domain of nursing.  The important change will be the development of faculty who can teach and lead students in this thinking in their ASU101 course using a foundational base of materials developed for all colleges and disciplines.  The faculty will need not only training in this mindset, but also exposure to and a working familiarity with the E+I ecosystem designed to support students once they complete ASU101, so that they can take their idea farther, such as through Edson E+I Venture Devils. In short, this project is designed to leverage the sophisticated E+I environment of ASU and scale its impact further and more immediately through ASU101 integration.  The existing structure of ASU101 helps to ensure that we are reaching and serving the broadest audience possible in that this is a required course for all students.  However, this assured participation by all students does not necessarily mean that we are alleviating all of the barriers to engaging in E+I.  As part of ASUs renewed commitment to justice, equity, diversity and inclusion, a focused effort has been placed on decolonizing the curriculum.  It will be of paramount importance to ensure that we challenge our assumptions regarding students background, personal value system and reward structure, ability or motivation to participate, available resources, and identification with the project and goals, just to name a few.  This conscious consideration should ideally lead to positive outcomes identified using a definition of success that is individual and student-centered, and not defined apriori. Though this view is in already in alignment with Edson E+Is approach to inclusive entrepreneurship, to help to ensure this continuation of inclusive principles and equitable practices to achieve diversity and a sense of belonging, as part of the training for faculty who will implement the model, we will include specific training in justice, equity, diversity and inclusion. 2  Team and Partners  On-campus partners in module development will be faculty from the aforementioned Edson College, College of Health Solutions (CHS), New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences (NCIAS), and the College of Integrated Science and Art (CISA).  This combination of colleges ensures a cross-disciplinary approach to the new modules development, with two of the colleges having Interdisciplinary/Integrated in their names.  Each of these colleges will have a hand in development of the new module through faculty representation, but more importantly through the contribution of undergraduate students who will actively participate in the development and testing of the new module (see timeline).  Training of faculty and dissemination to all the colleges will be assisted by the Edson E+I at ASU.  Edson College is located primarily on ASUs Downtown Phoenix campus, along with CHS.  NCIAS is on ASUs West campus, and is the largest college on that campus, though Edson College and CHS both also have a presence on the West campus.  CISA is located on the Polytechnic, Tempe, and Downtown Phoenix campuses, and is the largest presence at the Polytechnic campus.  NCIAS and Edson College have programs at the Havasu location.  All of these Colleges have programs that are part of ASU Online.  This distribution is important for ensuring the participation of students from underrepresented minority student groups; the proportions of students on these campuses who identify as an underrepresented minority (UM) closely match the population demographics found in the larger community (Table 1, student response rate ~80%).  Pell eligibility is an indicator of low socio-economic status (SES).

This #1 most innovative ranking designation is due, in part, to the efforts of the university to support students, faculty, and community members with the knowledge and resources to problem solve and launch solutions.  In fact, one of the eight design aspirations of the university is to Value Entrepreneurship (using knowledge and encouraging innovation).  The Edson E+I is one of the nations largest and most comprehensive institutes of practice established as a pan-university entrepreneurship support mechanism. The Institute is also well established in the greater Phoenix entrepreneurial ecosystem and nationally engaged, and is well positioned to co-create and disseminate the ASU101 E+I modules to all of the colleges at ASU.     Student groups who create innovation solutions will be asked to submit their ideas to the ASU Venture Devils, an entrepreneurial support program run by the Institute.  Students selected to participate in Venture Devils are provided mentorship, development coaching and funding through competitions.  In addition, students have access to a variety of place-based innovation spaces including makerspaces and fabrication labs throughout the campuses and in the greater community facilitated by Edson E+I. A new program, currently in its first year, created by the HEALab staff is a health-focused student entrepreneurship club, which is proving to serve as a bridge of sorts between Edson Colleges ASU101 and the Venture Devils.  In the student-led peer and near-peer environment of the club, students continue to develop their ideas, hear from successful entrepreneurs in and outside of ASU, and practice articulation of their ideas.  Students who have participated in this club have already seen higher success with their applications for Venture Devils and for pitch competitions, for those who choose this path.  Expanding this club or similar community-building mechanisms to each of the ASU campuses will be essential to the success of the new ASU101 module and seeing students through and into the E+I ecosystem.

It is our goal that the module continue to be tweaked in the Spring 2022 offering and is updated and implemented in all sections by all Colleges in Fall 2022, reaching upwards of 25,000 students.  It will be relatively easy to sustain the module beyond the initial development and distribution.  There will be an element of training others to deploy the module (see workplan, and next), but once there are many people skilled in this area, there will be many advocates for its use, and many hands updating and revising the module as needs continue to grow and change.       In order to incentivize initial training by faculty who might teach the module and/or want to become more embedded within E+I, we note above the creation of a series of badges leading to a credential, not unlike the existing, and very successful (100+ faculty participants in the Fall 2020 cohort), Global Leadership and Advocacy Certification for current ASU faculty.  This program will be free to the first cohort of faculty, and extended to other ASU faculty after the first cohort has completed the training.  Our goal is that 100 faculty are badged in the first year.  The program will also be offered outside of the ASU community after the first year, using a fee-based model, to sustain the programming beyond the life of the grant. Success of the module will be defined firstly by the incorporation of the module into ASU101.  However, true success will be the canonization of the module into ASU101, meaning it, or something stemming from it, is incorporated permanently into the curriculum.  For measurement purposes, multiple successive years of module inclusion will signal the permanency of the module.  Additionally, success will be measured by the number of students who take their concepts/ventures beyond ASU101 and truly into the E+I space.  Our goal is that 20 students will join the E+I clubs in the first year.  We will use existing tracking of these and all students, and compare pre and post-module implementation to get a quantifiable measure of the modules impact.    5 ",
FP00027049,442,,,,,1,,,"HCC: Medium: Designing and Building an Intelligent Wearable System for Precise At-home Physical Therapy  Overview Recent advances in sensing and networking technologies have made it possible to continuously acquire personal  health  data.  Still,  there  are  many  practical  barriers  to  capitalizing  on  such  advances  for achieving  precision  health.  Physical  therapy  has  been  routinely  used  in  prevention  and  treatment  of chronic  low  back  pain,  a  significant  heath  issue.  However,  presently  there  is  no  technology  to  reliably monitor compliance, ensure correctness, and track progress for unsupervised physical therapy at home. We identify two key technical challenges that impede the development of good solutions in this main: the system  challenge  and  the  inference  challenge.  To  address  these  challenges,  this  proposal  presents  a design-directed  development  of  a  novel  wearable  system  (addressing  the first  challenge)  complete  with innovative  machine  learning  or  artificial  intelligence  algorithms  (addressing  the  second  challenge)  for achieving precise at-home physical therapy, in the domain of chronic low back pain. Our specific goal is to  design,  develop  and  pilot-test  a  novel  wearable  system,  with  integrated  hardware  (system)  and software (algorithms), for supporting and improving unsupervised physical therapy at home, employing a patient-centric  approach  by  explicitly  considering  usability  factors.  We  also  demonstrate  that  the  project exemplifies  general  design  and  engineering  principles  in  developing  practical  solutions  overcoming practical barriers in more general precision health contexts.   Keywords:  Precision  health; Physical  Therapy; Wearable  System;  Machine/Deep Learning;  Information Fusion; Spatiotemporal Models.  Intellectual Merit Although  technological  advances  have  made  it  possible  to  bring  personal  health  devices  to  the  home, much more research is needed to increase the precision of these systems to provide specific  therapeutic benefits at home. The proposed work will bridge a significant knowledge gap in precise at-home physical therapy for treatment and prevention of chronic low back pain, which is a significant health risk to society. Our  research  efforts  will  advance  knowledge  and  practice  in  the  domains  of  wearable  systems  for healthcare,  embedded  machine  learning/artificial  intelligence,  unsupervised  physical  therapy,  and  user behavior with personal health devices, etc. Considering the nature of the problem, we employ a design-directed  approach  by  explicitly  addressing  all  aspects  of  the  effort  through  innovative  designs.  The innovations  in the proposed project  collectively  contribute to  building  a realistic  system for  addressing  a pressing  real-world  problem.  The  investigators  have  on-going  research  efforts  preparing  the  team  for addressing the  challenges  of  the  proposed  work,  including  studies  that form  the  foundation for  some of the proposed approaches. The unique composition of the team ensures that we have the right mixture of expertise for pursuing the proposed efforts.  Broader Impacts  The proposed research  will have  broad impact on the development of intelligent  multimodal systems for precision  health  in  the  general  domain  of  at-home  healthcare  and  in  the  specific  domain  of  precise  at-home  physical  therapy  for  chronic  low  back  pain.  Because  of  the  increasing  adoption  of  personal healthcare devices, the potential impact of the proposed research is evident as it exemplifies the design and engineering principles for developing solutions in such a context. The work will also contribute to the larger-scope  mission  of  precision  health  by  demonstrating  how  technical  and  practical  barriers  may  be overcome  through  design-directed  approaches.  The  proposed  research  will  impact  education  in  three ways.  First, students  will  be recruited  and  trained for  both research and  for  participation  in  user  studies and these involved students/participants will be directly exposed to the leading edge of building innovative healthcare  devices.  Second,  the  research  tasks  and  findings  will  fit  in  well  with  our  existing  courses  on pattern  recognition,  machine intelligence,  human-computer interaction,  movement  and  exercise  science,  and  so  forth,  further  contributing  to  the  investigators educational activities. Third, besides reporting our research findings in scholarly venues, we will employ a project website and other social media to publicize our research outcomes, with the goal of improving the publics understanding of technical advances for potential at-home healthcare applications. learning,  signal  processing,  artificial    ",
FP00027099,443,,,,,1,,,"Summary  Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for >50% of all heart failure patients and prevalence in 2020 is expected to exceed 8% in those older than 65 years. The epidemic of HFpEF parallels the explosive  increase  in  prevalence  of  cardiovascular  risk  factors  (CVRFs),  such  as  obesity,  diabetes, hyperlipidemia,  hypertension  and  aging,  which  are  etiologically  linked  to  HFpEF  through  poorly  understood mechanisms. No current therapy has improved HFpEF prognosis with large randomized trials yielding neutral results. This lack of progress is in large part due to existing knowledge gaps in our understanding of underlying mechanisms  and  treatment  targets.  (Disease)-on-a-chip  tissue  models  are  3D  miniaturized  tissue  models composed of human cellular components within a physiologic milieu that mimics conditions found in-vivo that are useful in studying pathophysiology and testing novel treatments in a rigorously controlled environment. We have  recently  developed  and  validated  a  working  heart-on-a-chip  model  from  co-culture  of  human cardiomyocytes (CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) that structurally and functionally mimics the in-vivo state in terms of highly anisotropic structure, synchronous contractility and mature cellular phenotypic and genotypic profile. We have also developed microscale tissue-engineered models of fibrosis in which we have shown that fibroblast activation promotes ECM remodeling and stiffness. However, there is currently no established HFpEF-on-a-chip model that closely recapitulates physiologic conditions driving HFpEF pathology. We contend that HFpEF-on-a-chip could fill the critical knowledge gaps in fully understanding the pathophysiology of HFpEF by serving  as  a  novel  tool  in  bridging  the  steps  in  the  continuum  between  observational  studiespreclinical investigationrandomized clinical trials. Building upon our foundational work, our overall goal in this study is to develop and validate a physiologically relevant HFpEF-on-a-chip tissue model to gain mechanistic understanding of  HFpEF  disease  development.  We  aim  to  systematically  study,  in  a  controlled  microenvironment,  specific mechanisms which are involved in the development of HFpEF. In Aim 1, we aim to determine how CVRFs and fibrotic insults induce HFpEF and validate the translational relevance of the proposed HFpEF-on-a-chip against HFpEF  patient  autopsy-derived  tissue  using  single-nucleus  RNA-seq.  In  Aim  2,  we  plan  to  discover mechanosensitive-related signaling cues by which fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) and activated CFs induce CM dysfunction in HFpEF. In Aim 3 we focus on testing whether microvascular inflammation causes cardiac transformation  to  HFpEF  phenotype.  Our  proposal  is  significant  and  innovative  in  concept  and  approach. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to development of a practical, cost-effective model to understand the pathophysiology of HFpEF, identify new targets and test new treatments which, hand-in-hand with in-vivo animal testing, could improve and rationalize drug development testing and safety in human clinical trials.

FP00027124,444,,,,,1,,,"Craftwork as Soulwork: Sanctifying Scientific Practice among Genetics Researchers Project Summary  We propose to develop a model of personal and spiritual formation for genetics researchers, whether they identify as secular or religious. Working with scientists in our three participating labs and experts in spiritual formation, we will collectively discover and adapt practices drawn from a range of western and non-weestern traditions that might prove effective in helping researchers bring the technical dimensions of their work into a deeper relation to their own sense of moral and spiritual purpose. These efforts will emphasize traditions of craftwork and craftsmanship as they have been shaped by and through monastic practice. We are a team of scientists, philosophers and anthropologists who have observed first-hand the breakdown, not only of scientific integrity but a vision for a truly human future that occurs when researchers failas the old saying goesto connect their hands, head, and heart through their work. How one undertakes technical work (hands), must be aligned with reflection on what one is doing (head), and a commitment to the common good (heart). This project seeks to restore that richer vision for science by working together to reconstitute the lab as a space of moral and spiritual formation.  Our prior work has found that a younger generation of scientists today is prepared not only to talk about the broader significance of their work, but are receptive to and welcoming of a vernacular of spiritual and personal formation. Embracing that openness, over the course of two years, we propose to convene scientists from three biology and biotech labs, for a series of lab meetings on the relation of personal formation and craftwork, within their labs and in off-site retreats. These meetings will provide a forum in which aspiring and seasoned researchers alike can think about the meaning of their work and how best to pursue their ambitions. Facilitated by specialists (teachers, counselors, monks, and clerics) representing secular, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Yogic, Indigenous, and Jewish traditions, we will work together to: (a) audit the technical and scientific demands of the research underway in the labs, (b) collectively and creatively connect those demands to the idea of craftwork as soulwork, and (c) establish a set of techniques and processes by way of which the scientists can approach their work as a formational practice.  We anticipate that by the end of year one we will have a growing set of such techniques to continue experimenting with over the course of year two. We expect that ensemble and that experimentation to function in a manner similar to classical traditions of spiritual practice. In these traditions, spiritual equipment consisted of insights, habits, mindsets and techniques to be exercised through craftwork. In addition to our group meetings, the project team will meet regularly with individual members of the three labs. Our goal will be to refine strategies for using the spiritual equipment in connection to our technical work.  These efforts take inspiration from the historically important fact that the monastery was an important historical antecedent to the modern laboratory. Unlike the medieval university in which truth was sought through contemplation and discourse, in the monastery physical activities, regimented work, and artisanal skillcraftworkwere integral to the life of discovery and invention. In that tradition, we view the lab as an intentionally designed community, structured around rhythms of work and reflection, and established to achieve levels of excellence that could not be reached otherwise. From Buddhist notions of work-practice to Benedictine ideas of ora et labora, what such communities of practice share is a deep feel for how craftwork (i.e. the labors needed to sustain and advance collective and personal life) can be taken up as soulwork (i.e. the deep, sustained labor needed to become the people we aspire to be, individually and collectively). Throughout, the project team will interview scientific and religious participants in order to track the effectiveness of the efforts underway and tune project efforts accordingly. This two year project will specify what aspects of craftwork as soulwork might be generative for laboratory life more broadly, and lay the groundwork for a scaled project that could further validate, enrich, and communicate our findings.

FP00027149,445,,,,,1,,,"In March 2021, the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University will host the Speech, Language, and Learning Intervention  Virtual Research Symposium (SLLIVRS)The primary purpose of the symposium is to increase collaboration and knowledge sharing among current and future health researchers and professionals specializing in speech and language disabilities, who work with culturally and linguistically diverse children. In 2018, 14 percent of students in Pre-K through 12th grade were identified as having a disability and 34 percent of those students were from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (NCES, 2020). These learners face a unique set of challenges requiring different types and levels of support to positively impact their academic success. Currently there are very few interventions that meet their needs and increase their academic success. Collaboration between service providers and researchers is critical to the success of this special population of children. A team of doctoral trainees in the Speech and Hearing program have organized this groundbreaking conference under the mentorship of Drs. Shelley Gray and M. Adelaida Restrepo. Historically, clinicians and researchers have been trained separately from each other, which results in professional silos of researchers and practitioners (clinicians and educators) that impede community-based research and the development and dissemination of interventions that will be readily used in the community. Because of the pressing need to increase collaboration among clinicians and researchers, the symposium planning team designed SLLIVRS to bring together stakeholder groups from around the country who are focused on the unique treatment needs of culturally and linguistically diverse children. Conference topics and the conference schedule will facilitate dialogue between researchers and practitioners to address interventions for linguistically diverse children with speech, language and learning disorders.

FP00027196,446,,,,,1,,,"Chronic disease management is frequently carried out without awareness of the presence of social determi-nants of health (SDOH) that can have negative impact on care and outcome. The project aims to address this deficiency by modifying typical clinical decision support (CDS) for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hyperten-sion, renal failure, and depression, to take into account SDOH factors that may be present and to alert the pro-vider to the need for further attention to them. Faculty in Biomedical Informatics at Arizona State University (ASU) are partnering with leaders at a large Phoenix-Area health system, HonorHealth (HH), to develop such rules for a variety of practice settings and for at least two vendor-based electronic health record (EHR) plat-forms. Some rules and order sets will be triggered asynchronously by abnormal laboratory test findings. Some will be triggered on the basis of periodic quality reports that identify SDOH factors in the presence of the dis-ease conditions being monitored; they will alert the providers if follow up is considered needed. Among such conditions detected might be missed appointments or persistent out-of-range lab test results. Other rules and order sets will be invoked during interaction (login or access to patients record) for patients with SDOH who have abnormal or missed results.The project will target primary care practices, both community-based and those in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) setting. Four aims are proposed: (1) Convene a stakeholder panel including patient advocates to oversee the specification and approval by HH pf a set of SDOH-adapted chronic disease CDS artifacts to be im-plemented, designate practices to serve as initial sites, and monitor the assessment and adoption process. (2) Refine sources for SDOH data collection or indirect detection, coding methods, and prioritization based on ana-lytics regarding their correlation with disease progression and outcome. (3) Implement interoperable CDS us-ing Clinical Query Language (CQL) and Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data access methods. To in-tegrate the CDS with the EHR platform, through interoperable methods for encoding and, to the extent possi-ble, adapting to the workflow and interaction mode using models such as CDS Hooks and Smart-on-FHIR where appropriate. To disseminate the artifacts as well as the workflow integration approach using CDS Connect. (4) Evaluate the interoperable approach vs. the native EHR-based approach for implementing CDS, in both a labor-atory testbed and actual development setting, to assess learning effects over time, with additional rules, and with different EHR platforms.The investigators bring together broad experience in informatics, with an emphasis on CDS, knowledge model-ing, and standards, quality analytics, SDOH monitoring and care improvement initiatives The results of this work are expected to be of value, not only locally but to the broader community.",
FP00027273,447,,,,,1,,,"The increasing availability of health data in sub-Saharan Africa is not matched by the capacity for its analysis to generate information to address health conditions of public health importance. Expansion of the capacity to use data science tools to derive novel ways of understanding health data for action in low income countries is a priority in the NIHs current strategy. Across sub-Saharan Africa, there is low application of large data analytics to generate deeper evidence for action. Data structures in many settings are often non-standardized, leading to challenges in archiving and cross-national analyses. For example, patient specific data generated from actual points-of-care in rural health facilities remains largely paper-based while that generated from community health workers is patchy and often of low structure.Low- income countries face a high burden of preventable health conditions including infectious diseases (especially Malaria, Pneumonia, TB, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases and epidemics/pandemic threats), maternal and perinatal conditions, anemia and malnutrition, and a surge in non-communicable diseases. Further compounding these challenges are the weak support systems for health service delivery. To overcome these major challenges, innovative solutions and approaches are needed to drive a more efficient health system. If adequately used to generate new information, solutions and tools, data and data science provide a robust platform for such innovation. Yet there is a paucity of institutions and research groups focused on harnessing the full capabilities of such data in sub-Saharan Africa, hence the need for leadership in Data Science and Scholarship in the region.The increasing availability of large sets of health data from Health information systems, large serial surveys and large unstructured datasets provides opportunities for public health actors in sub-Saharan Africa to harness data science tools for public health action. The proposed project will address three key problem areas: (1) The inadequate use of existing large datasets to inform public health programming; (2) The insufficiency in forecasting of drugs and medical supplies; and (3) inadequacy of access to timely continuing medical education and emergency consultations among rural health workers. ADSRIH The Research Hub will (1) establish a national Large National Data Analysis project to solicit large national datasets and mine them to generate new types of information in form of signals and cues to drive new approaches to prevention, prediction and timely response to public health priorities; (2) conduct pilot research on how demand-sensing tools can improve the forecasting and management of essential drugs in public health facilities by using both existing and incident patient data in rural facilities. (3) conduct research on a low cost, contextually relevant, data-driven tele-education  platform  to improve delivery of Continuous Medical Education (CME) and Support Decision Making for Health Workers in Remote Health Facilities telemedicine application that can link health workers in rural clinics to experts for emergency consultations as well as deliver demand-driven continuing medical education and skills training.The specific aims of this initiative therefore are:1.To develop and operationalize a multi-disciplinary framework for increased utilization of data for enhancement of health outcomes in Africa2.To develop a multi-country platform that will facilitate analyses of large-scale national level health data to inform the prevention, mitigation, forecasting and response to health conditions of major public health importance in Africa3.To source, develop, incubate and support the transition to scale of innovations to increase the use of data science tools in building health-system productivity and efficiency4.To strengthen collaborative efforts and resource sharing in the use of data science tools to improve health programming in AfricaResults from this study will be used to co-create and test contextualized data science tools and approaches to increase the use of available health data as well as the collection of new forms of data.

FP00027294,448,,,,,1,,,"Food insecurity (FI) involves insufficient access to an adequate quantity of affordable and nutritious foods. A critical knowledge gap exists concerning how FI impacts behavior and health outcomes among various populations. Impulsivity is characterized by unplanned and risky behaviors, and disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) involve unhealthy lifestyle habits pertaining to eating and weight control. No studies have used a longitudinal design to investigate impulsivity and DEBs as potential behavioral mechanisms of FI. Through three primary research aims and supplemental exploratory aims, this study will examine the effects of FI on impulsivity, DEBs, and obesity status with longitudinal statistical models. Preliminary findings suggest cross-sectional relationships between FI, impulsivity, and DEBs, thus accentuating the need to fill a knowledge gap concerning the effect of FI on impulsivity over time. For the proposed study, a college student sample (n=184) will be recruited to evaluate the relationship between FI, impulsivity, and DEBs over at three timepoints over an entire academic school year. The first primary aim of this study is to examine the extent to which the effect of food security status on DEBs over time among college students is mediated by impulsivity. The second primary aim is to determine the extent to which the effect of impulsivity on DEBs over time is moderated by food security status. The third primary aim is to test the longitudinal effect of FI on impulsivity. Exploratory aims include, analyzing the effect of FI on BMI; evaluating whether DEBs mediate the effect of FI on BMI; and testing the extent to which an FI and DEBs interaction is linked to BMI. Longitudinal statistical analyses including autoregressive mediation and multilevel modeling will be used to achieve the aims in the proposed study. Resulting data will indicate the extent to which FI influences impulsivity and DEBs over time, which will fill a critical knowledge gap concerning how FI impacts behaviors and health outcomes. Study hypotheses include impulsivity mediating the effect of FI on DEBs; food security status moderating impulsivity levels, and FI maintaining a significant effect on impulsivity over time. Meaningful implications will be produced from this research, as study findings will inform future research interventions and public health policy efforts aimed at preventing FI to avoid unhealthy behaviors (e.g., impulsivity, DEBs) and poor health outcomes (e.g., obesity). The long-term goal of this proposal is to equip public health practitioners and higher education institutional administrators with knowledge on how downstream effects of FI can result in the development of adverse health behaviors and outcomes among vulnerable college students.",
FP00027339,449,,,,,1,,," PROJECT SUMMARY OVERVIEW:  SCH: Smart Human-in-the-loop User Effective Shoe (SHOES) for Ankle Injury Prevention PI: Hyunglae Lee, Co-PIs: Matthew Buman, Pavan Turaga, and Sze Zheng Yong Lead Institution: Arizona State University  This project explores unique approaches for ankle injury prevention using a system called Smart Human-in-the-loop User Effective Shoe (SHOES), with the long-term goal of preserving/promoting ankle health and enhancing behavioral adherence to expert/clinical recommendations. Chronic ankle instability can lead to significant public health and financial burden, and current approaches (e.g., passive support from ankle taping, manual ankle braces) have limited utility due to constantly restricted ankle motion leading to muscle and soft tissue atrophy and sub-optimal adherence. This project seeks to study the unique smart shoe system, using integrated scientific solutions of engineering, computing and behavioral science, to overcome these limitations  and  support  enhanced  user/patient  care  for  individuals  at  risk  of  ankle  injury.  The  SHOES system is equipped with wireless sensors, an active soft ankle brace as well as machine learning, prediction and control algorithms that provide assist-as-needed ankle support during challenging physical activities. In  addition,  the  proposed  system  includes  a  mobile  user  interface  for  providing  feedback  to  the users/patients on their progress, use, and adherence to expert/clinical prescriptions. We will engage heavily throughout validation and evaluation phases of this project with clinical partners to ensure the system is tailored toward optimal clinical integration in mind, readying a prototype for clinical efficacy testing at the conclusion of this project. Therefore, the SHOES system broadly targets to prevent ankle injury, improve health outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this highly prevalent health concern.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The proposed research pursues an integrated approach to substantially enhance the effectiveness of the current practice of passive ankle bracing or taping to reduce the risk of ankle injury during various physical activities. We propose to achieve improved injury prevention by designing a smart shoe system, namely SHOES, with the capability of actively supporting the ankle as-needed and providing feedback to the target users on their adherence to risk-neutral gaits. The overarching goal will be accomplished by tackling the following scientific challenges: (i) accurate modeling of foot-ankle mechanics from in-situ data collected by  wireless  wearable  sensors,  (ii)  robust,  real-time  estimation  of  biomechanical  data  and  activity recognition  using  topological  machine  learning  algorithms  and  nonlinear  dynamics,  (iii)  integration  of injury risk prediction and assist-as-needed control algorithms with a novel soft actuator design for ankle injury prevention, and (iv) delivery of an intuitive user interface that provides real-time and summative injury risk metrics to promote user adherence to ankle sprain prevention strategies. The proposed integration of  wireless  sensors  and  active  stiffness-controlled  actuators  with  biomechanics-based  estimation  and control algorithms provides a better scientific understanding of foot-ankle mechanics and their correlation to the risk of ankle injuries, and allows for continuous injury risk prediction and active support of ankle health in real time. The real-time data and predicted risk measure will be communicated via a mobile app that is designed based on behavioral studies and needs of users and clinical providers.   BROADER IMPACTS:  This research will benefit fundamental understanding of how active joint support (e.g., ankle, knee, hip) via closed-loop assist-as-needed control improves the overall function of human users such as athletes, elderly people, and patients with ankle problems during various physical activities by improving joint stability and reducing the injury risk without hindering performance nor contributing to potential muscle and soft tissue atrophy. In addition, gait/motion data of users can be acquired in free-living conditions, i.e., outside research or clinical labs, providing valuable data for better understanding the causes of ankle or other joint injuries. On the societal level, continuous assessment and injury prevention will lead to a significant reduction of healthcare cost and may also translate to impacting rehabilitation of other motor impairments such as stroke. Examples of educational impact include new college-level course offerings on smart health and outreach to K-12 students, in particular women and minorities in engineering.SCH: Smart Human-in-the-loop User Effective Shoe (SHOES) for Ankle Injury Prevention    Project Vision and Goals The goal of the proposed project is to design and evaluate a smart shoe system called Smart Human-in-the-loop User Effective Shoe (SHOES) for ankle injury prevention, via thoroughly planned studies to tackle the following scientific challenges:   Transformative  Data  Science:  Robust,  real-time  estimation  of  biomechanical  data  and  activity recognition from wearable sensors using topological machine learning algorithms and nonlinear dynamics; Accurate modeling of foot-ankle mechanics and real-time likelihood prediction of ankle injury from in-situ wireless insole and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data;   Automating Health: Integration of injury risk prediction and assist-as-needed control algorithms with an active, fabric-based, soft ankle brace to improve ankle injury prevention;    Effective  Usability:  Delivery  of  an  intuitive  user  interface  via  a  mobile  application  (app)  that provides real-time and summative injury risk metrics to promote user adherence to ankle sprain prevention strategies, based on iterative design, validation, and clinical integration studies. The project incorporates rigorous evaluation plans to assess (i) the reliability and reproducibility of the sensor data processing and actuation technologies in the SHOES system, (ii) the accuracy and effectiveness of biomechanical modeling, injury prediction, and control algorithms, and (iii) the reliability and usability of the mobile app interface to promote behavioral adherence and clinical integration.  Background  Ankle sprains, which mostly occur due to excessive inversion of the foot1,2, are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries (2 million/yr. in the US) that can significantly impact physical activities, ranging from normal walking to sports activities3-6. Importantly, about 40% of people with ankle sprains experience recurrent ankle sprains, which are a major cause of chronic ankle instability and may lead to long-term disability7-9. The financial burden from ankle sprains is also significant, with an estimated healthcare cost of 2 billion dollars associated with the treatment of ankle sprains3,10. Thus, prevention of ankle sprains during day-to-day and sports activities, through a proper support mechanism is essential to not only improve the overall performance and quality of daily activities but also the quality of life. External passive supports, such as ankle taping and bracing, are the most widely used approaches to prevent  ankle  sprains.  Compared  with  no  prevention,  passive  support  from  ankle  taping  and  bracing significantly  reduces  (by  two-  to  five-fold)  the  incidence  of  ankle  sprains11,12,  which  has  been  mainly attributed to the increased ankle stiffness with the addition of external support13,14. However, long-term use of ankle taping and bracing might make patients overly reliant on the passive and constant support, which could lead to ankle muscle and soft tissue atrophy15. Excessive restriction of ankle motion could also lead to the decreased ankle ability to resist external perturbations when the support is not used16,17. Furthermore, this approach will not only restrict inversion-eversion motion in the frontal plane but also dorsiflexion-plantarflexion motion in the sagittal plane, which in turn may alter lower-extremity biomechanics18,19. These major limitations motivate the need of a new approach to actively support the ankle in the frontal plane only as needed, while not interfering with natural ankle motion in the sagittal plane.    We propose an innovative approach to overcome the limitations of conventional passive ankle support approaches and provide active ankle support by introducing an innovative shoe system, which integrates cutting-edge data processing of wearable sensor data, a soft ankle brace with stiffness adjustment capability, sophisticated biomechanical models of foot-ankle mechanics, advanced injury risk prediction and control algorithms, and an intuitive user interface with real-time and summative injury risk metrics. Intellectual Merit  The proposed research pursues a novel and unique approach to substantially enhance the effectiveness of the current antiquated practice of passive ankle bracing or taping to reduce the risk of ankle injury during various physical activities. Backed by research findings that passive ankle braces can be counterproductive by overly restricting ankle motion, we propose to achieve the improved injury prevention effectiveness via    1  a  novel  shoe  system  with  the  capability  of actively  adjusting  ankle  support,  only  when needed,  based  on  in-situ  biomechanical  data collected  by  wireless  insole  and  IMU  sensors, and  providing  feedback  to  the  target  users  on their to  prescribed/risk-neutral walking or running gaits.  adherence    Fig. 1:  A comparison of (left) current ankle injury prevention with a passive  ankle  brace  that  restricts  motion,  and  (right)  the  proposed active approach with a smart and connected shoe system that provides closed-loop assist-as-needed ankle support and feedback to the users to improve adherence to ankle sprain prevention strategies. The novel elements include: (i) an integrated approach to  provide  closed-loop  assist-as-needed  ankle  support  based  on  innovations  in sensor  data  processing,  activity  recognition, actuator  technologies,  prediction  and  control algorithms, and (ii) a just-in-time and summative behavioral self-monitoring tool, in the form of a mobile app, that enables closed-loop connection between users/patients and clinicians/experts to promote  adherence  (Fig.  1).  Our  integrated approach  advances  several  SCH  program priorities  including:  Transformative  Data  Science,  Automating  Health,  and  Effective  Usability    all pressed into service to develop the next generation of devices and systems for ankle injury prevention.  Potential to advance scientific unknowns in biomechanics, closed-loop control, and behavioral sciences The integration of machine learning and nonlinear dynamics-based estimation of biomechanical data from insole and IMU sensors and active stiffness-controlled soft ankle brace with prediction and control algorithms enables robust continuous assessment of foot-ankle mechanics, specifically, ankle stiffness and foot loading trajectory, as a means for predicting ankle sprains and preventing injuries via active ankle support. Unlike the current approach of passive ankle support, this approach (i) provides a new pathway to understand foot-ankle mechanics and their correlation to ankle injury risk during various physical activities, (ii) enables prediction and risk quantification of ankle injury, (iii) provides active in-situ, assist-as-needed ankle support, and (iv) advances technology-mediated behavioral science by implementing just-in-time and summative feedback to the user to promote adherence to ankle prevention strategies. Broader Impacts On the scientific level, this research will benefit fundamental understanding of how active ankle support via closed-loop assist-as-needed control improves the overall lower extremity function of users, such as athletes, elderly people, and patients with ankle problems, during various physical activities by improving ankle stability and reducing the risk of ankle injury without hindering performance nor contributing to muscle and soft tissue atrophy. Further, various lower extremity data (e.g., standing, walking, running, etc.) can be acquired in free-living conditions (i.e., outside research or clinical labs), providing valuable data for better understanding the causes of injuries and may lead to individually-tailored solutions. In addition, the scientific understanding and lessons from this research will pave the way for developing active support technologies for other joints such as the knee or hip, and, more generally, cyber-physical medical devices.  On the societal level, continuous assessment of ankle health and injury prevention will lead to reliable healthcare and a significant reduction of healthcare cost. The proposed research will also be applicable to impact  rehabilitation  of  other  motor  impairments  such  as  stroke  and  Parkinsons  disease.  Educational impact includes new college-level course offerings on smart health, outreach to K-12 students and local clinics, and a variety of outreach activities to attract women and minority students in engineering. Team to conduct the research Our team is comprised of biomechanics and robotics, machine learning, and control engineers, a behavioral scientist, an orthopedic physician, and a physical therapist, qualified to develop and test cutting-edge technologies and to pair them with a user-friendly platform to support adherence to treatment    2  regimens, which has been challenging for clinicians when supporting their patients. All major decisions will be determined by both scientists/engineers and clinicians, including the precision requirements for the foot-ankle mechanics model and the prediction and control algorithms, the user/patient-facing components of the technology (i.e., mobile app), and the contents delivered to responsible clinicians/users. Lee has been trained in the biomechanical characterization and modeling of joints, specifically the ankle.  He  will  be  in  charge  of  quantification  and  modeling  of  foot-ankle  mechanics,  design  and implementation of the active, soft ankle brace with a stiffness adjustment capability. Turaga specializes in developing robust machine-learning methods, especially for time-series data from wearables devices. He will be responsible for the development of robust estimation techniques, using hybrid models that combine dynamical systems theory and machine-learning, and the analysis of the time-series data for robust activity recognition in free-living conditions. Yong has studied control and estimation algorithms for complex and uncertain cyber-physical systems, and will be in charge of design and implementation of the prediction and control algorithms to provide active assist-as-needed ankle support. Buman is a physical activity behavioral scientist that specializes in the study of technology-supported health interventions, and will oversee the design and implementation of the patient-facing mobile app and evaluate its usability to support the SHOES system.  Scott  (orthopedic  physician  at  the  CORE  Institute  in  Phoenix,  AZ)  and  Jagodzinski  (physical therapist at the Rise Orthopedic and Sports PT LLC in Phoenix, AZ), with years of experience in ankle rehabilitation, will work with the ASU team to design treatment protocols/plans, and assess performance measures, in addition to evaluating the efficacy of the proposed approach in a patient group. Research Thrusts on Studying a SHOES System for Ankle Injury Prevention (Fig. 2)   Thrust  1  will  focus  on  the study  of  robust  sensor  data processing activity recognition,  and  design  and  implementation  of  a  smart shoe  system  consisting  of active  soft  ankle  brace  with stiffness adjustment capability and  wireless  insole  and  IMU sensors. and   Thrust  2  will focus  on biomechanical  modeling  of foot-ankle  mechanics, in particular,  ankle  stiffness  and foot loading trajectory during various lower extremity activities expected in free-living activities.    Fig. 2:  Block diagram of the tightly integrated research plans for developing a SHOES system for ankle injury prevention with active ankle support.   Thrust 3 will focus on the study of human-in-the-loop prediction and control algorithms for the SHOES system. This thrust will include prediction of ankle injury risk based on real-time biomechanical data and  activity  recognition  from  Thrusts  1  and  2,  active  risk  reduction,  and  feasibility  testing  of  the algorithms. Further, we will incorporate user preference as well as feedback from clinical providers or trainers from Thrust 4 to tune/select appropriate control gains.   Thrust 4 will focus on the refinement of the developed algorithms for free-living use and design and implementation of a mobile app to enhance behavioral adherence and usability. This thrust will engage target users (i.e., individuals at risk of ankle sprains) and clinicians to understand user- and clinic-driven factors to ready the SHOES system prototype for future clinical testing.  Thrust 1: Design and integration of robust sensor data processing and soft active ankle brace  The objective of this thrust is to design and implement a SHOES system that integrates (i) robust, real-time estimation of biomechanical data and activity recognition from wearable sensors (wireless insole and IMU sensors) based on nonlinear dynamics theories and machine learning algorithms and (ii) soft actuators that actively adjust the stiffness of the ankle brace based on real-time sensor data. Performance of the integrated system will be thoroughly evaluated against benchmark metrics.   3 Task 1.1: Design and implementation of robust, real-time sensor data processing and activity recognition based on nonlinear dynamics theories and machine learning algorithms  Robust  sensor  data  processing:  Gait  analysis  and  modeling  from  sensor  data  have  been  reported extensively, yet many challenges remain unsolved20-23. One common challenge observed in time-series data from wearable sensors is that the sensor readings can be corrupted by a variety of external factors, e.g., sensor misalignment and other sensor-level issues like drift sampling rate-variations. If uncompensated for, this leads to a drop in the quality of any features that are extracted from the time-series24. To create high quality  estimates  of  the  time-series,  it  is  best  to  model  the  time-series  as  a  composition  of   a  clean waveform with a corruption variable, and the most common corruption variable is that of temporal rate variations24-26. As illustrated in Fig. 3, for noisy gait-data recorded by an IMU, our preliminary work25 showed that decoupling the rate variations, as a pre-processing step, results in improved quality of features and enhanced activity recognition performance24, when used with standard machine-learning pipelines.   Fig. 3: Rate-invariant auto-encoders that decouple noisy sensor data into a temporally aligned form, which are more suitable for downstream computation. Topologically relevant features from the aligned time-series will be extracted via topological methods as well as approximate neural architectures for faster computation. Thus, to integrate more closely with contemporary deep-learning based classification methods, we seek to advance rate-invariant feature-learning that fuses ideas of temporal warp removal with feature-learning methods to include rate-invariant representations. This will enable fusion with activity recognition pipelines including RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, which are more commonly used in time-series modeling27. We will also develop  latent-space  constraints  based  on  our  work  in  rate-invariant  feature-learning.  We  will  extract informative features for Thrusts 2, 3 and 4 from a cleanly estimated IMU and center-of-pressure (COP) traces, by combining deep-learning based feature-learning and shape-based topological methods.    Robust activity recognition: One of the technical challenges in free-living conditions is that we do not always know what the person is doing, and there is often not enough data to train robust machine-learning models, especially those based on deep-learning28,29. This necessitates the deployment of robust activity recognition methods that can either pre-filter the data into relevant segments such as walking, or provide posterior estimates over certain commonly occurring classes, where the posteriors may be used to weight the estimates of ankle stiffness and foot loading trajectory appropriately. The challenge is then how we can obtain robust activity-recognition models with only small datasets.  Our  previous  work  found  significant  robustness  of  topological  signal  processing  approaches  for activity recognition in free-living conditions30, where access to large training-sets is not always available. We have applied these tools to physiological data including in polysomnography31, wearable IMUs and COP recordings from Parkinsons patients32. We have found that topological features are more robust to nuisance including sensor misalignment and intrinsic sensor noise, yet sensitive enough to detect true stable features, when applied to IMU sensor data for activity recognition applications33.    4  We will use optimal Bayesian fusion methods that  are  particularly  useful  when  we  cannot  fully anticipate what the free-living activities might be. Quantities like ankle stiffness can be weighted by the posterior probability of a class given sensor data. In the past, we used this method to estimate energy expenditure  from  IMUs34.  In  this  project,  we  will develop models of ankle stiffness per activity class (Thrust  2),  and  use  Bayesian  estimates  of  ankle stiffness for free-living activities (Thrust 3).   Task  1.2:  Design  and  implementation  of  a  soft active ankle brace with variable stiffness capability We  will  design  and  implement  a  soft  fabric-based  ankle  brace  that  provides  active  ankle support in inversion-eversion in the frontal plane, while  not  constraining  natural  dorsiflexion-plantarflexion ankle movement in the sagittal plane (Fig. 4A). The rationale behind this design is that most  ankle  sprains/injuries  occur  in  the  frontal plane2. In fact, ankle stiffness in the frontal plane is substantially lower than in the sagittal plane during various lower extremity activities35-39.   air the required  Active  ankle  support  will  be  achieved  using fabric-based soft actuators with a patent-pending variable  stiffness  mechanism40.  The  soft  fabric-based  (thermoplastic  polyurethane  (TPU)  coated nylon fabric) actuators with thin rigid retainers (3D printed Polylactic Acid) can obtain varying levels of lateral stiffness while limiting vertical expansion of the  fabric  layers  (Fig.  4B).  This  design  with  an alternating pattern of rigid and soft segments greatly reduces for pressurization,  decreases  the  time  for  actuation,  and  maximizes  user  comfort.  Further,  we  recently confirmed that this new actuator design outperforms state-of-the-art soft actuators in terms of the resolution of  stiffness  modulation,  actuator  bandwidth,  and  power  consumption41.  The  actuator  is  powered  by  a lightweight, portable pneumatic control system (compressed liquid CO2 bottle and pressure regulator; 680 g) (JacPac J-6901-99, Supplierpipeline Inc., Canada).   Fig. 4: A: Inversion-eversion ankle motion in the frontal plane. B: A concept illustration and a prototype of the patent-pending variable  stiffness  actuators.  C:  A  prototype  of  the  soft  active ankle brace with the variable stiffness actuators. D: Stiffness at the  human  ankle  joint  for  different  ankle  brace  conditions.  E: Human walking over compliant ground with the soft active ankle brace.  F:  Peak-to-peak  lateral  ankle  deflections  in  the  frontal plane for different ankle brace conditions. amount  of We recently developed a prototype to test its effectiveness during upright standing balance and walking (Fig. 4C). The actuators were embedded into each side of the ankle brace. The prototype only weighs 203 g. Our first preliminary results show that the active ankle brace can effectively change inversion-eversion stiffness at the ankle joint from about 20 to 70 Nm/rad at relatively low pressure levels (~ 30 kPa), while minimizing  the  change  in  dorsiflexion-plantarflexion  stiffness  in  the  sagittal  plane  (Fig.  4D).  It  is worthwhile to note that ankle stiffness of 70 Nm/rad in the frontal plane is significantly higher than the stiffness that unimpaired young individuals can achieve with muscle activation37-39. Thus, the proposed design  should  be  able  to  provide  sufficient  active  support  to  the  ankle  in  the  frontal  plane  without constraining natural ankle movement in the sagittal plane. Our second preliminary results show that the active ankle brace can effectively support lateral ankle stability during walking over compliant surfaces (Fig. 4E), as evidenced by a significant reduction in the peak-to-peak ankle deflection in the frontal plane (Fig. 4F). Throughout the project, details of optimal actuator dimensions and placement will be studied based upon simulations with finite element analysis, human testing, and feedback from Thrusts 2, 3 and 4.   5 Evaluation Plan: Performance evaluation of the sensing and actuation capabilities  We will develop a prototype for the smart shoe by integrating the soft active ankle brace with wireless insole (Moticon insole, zFlo Motion, NE) and IMU sensors (ADXC 1500, Analog Devices, MA), and thoroughly evaluate its sensing and actuation capabilities in practical settings. While the insole sensor and IMU  sensors  are  already  calibrated  component-wise,  we  will  further  evaluate  their  performance  when integrated into the smart shoe and used by human users. This is particularly important since the sensor readings can be corrupted in practical settings by a variety of external factors.  First, we will evaluate the performance of the insole sensor to estimate foot loading trajectory (COP and ground reaction force (GRF)) by using a gold standard instrumented treadmill (Bertec Treadmill, OH, USA). We will also evaluate the performance of the IMU sensors to estimate ankle kinematics by using a 3D motion capture system (Bonita 10, VICON, UK). The evaluation will be performed while human users wear  the  smart  shoe  and  perform  various  lower  extremity  activities  including  standing,  walking,  and running. If there exists any significant discrepancies between the robust estimates from Task 1.1 and direct measurements, we will further implement a calibration function to correct them.  Next, we will evaluate the actuation capability of the smart shoe for lateral ankle support that will involve an iterative process of updating the design of the variable stiffness actuators (e.g., pattern of the rigid and soft segments) and experimentally validating their performance. The goal of this evaluation is to maximize the accuracy and resolution of stiffness realization in the frontal plane without constraining ankle movement in the sagittal plane, to minimize the amount of air required for pressurization and the time for actuation, and to maximize user comfort. To this end, we will integrate the ankle brace into a physical mockup loosely resembling the human ankle-foot complex having zero stiffness, and test this integrated system using a patented robotic force-plate platform42,43 that we used in our preliminary study (Fig. 4DF).  Prior Work Relevant to This Thrust Turaga  has  a  track  record  of  nonlinear  dynamical  modeling  and  machine-learning  for  biomedical applications32,33,44,45. In addition, Lee has a track record of developing and using robotic devices for the quantification of multi-dimensional ankle stiffness for various lower extremity activities35-39,41-43,46-51. Thrust 2: Quantification and modeling of foot-ankle mechanics  The first objective of this thrust is to quantify and model ankle stiffness and foot loading trajectory in healthy individuals with no history of ankle injury, which will be used as a baseline to determine the optimal amount of ankle support (Thrust 3). The second objective is to quantify and model ankle stiffness in people at  risk  of  ankle  sprains,  which  will  allow  us  to  estimate  ankle  stiffness  in  real  time  for  the  likelihood prediction of ankle sprains and closed-loop control of the shoe (Thrust 3). It should be noted that we will perform  the  quantification  and  modeling  tasks  using  fully-validated  equipment  (the  robotic  force-plate platform explained in Task 2.1) so that we can pursue both Thrusts 1 and 2 in parallel.  Task 2.1: Quantify ankle stiffness and foot loading trajectory in people with no history of ankle injury A crucial prerequisite to build competent models of ankle stiffness and foot loading trajectory is rich quantification datasets. Thus, we will first quantify ankle stiffness and foot loading trajectory when healthy people perform various lower extremity activities. In particular, we will quantify ankle stiffness in the frontal plane and foot loading trajectory by measuring COP and GRF during standing, walking, and running activities. While ankle quasi-stiffness has been typically studied using traditional motion analysis techniques52,53, it should be noted that quasi-stiffness and stiffness are distinct concepts during functional tasks involving muscle activation54,55. There have been several recent studies directly quantifying ankle stiffness during functional tasks38,49,56,57, but the quantification results were not rich enough to cover a range of tasks that are common in daily activities.  To  overcome  these  limitations  and  extend  the  quantification  of  ankle  stiffness,  we  will  utilize  the robotic force-plate platform, recessed into an instrumented walkway (Fig. 5). This platform is capable of applying precise perturbations to the ankle and measuring the corresponding ankle torques42,43, which is necessary  for  reliable  quantification  of  ankle  stiffness32,33.  In  this  project,  we  will  install  two  robotic platforms side-by-side into the walkway, which will significantly reduce the experimental time.     6 Our experimental plan focuses on lower extremity tasks expected in normal daily activities. Thirty adults (15 males and  15  females)  with  no  history  of  ankle  injury  will participate in standing, walking, and running experiments on 3 separate days. Each experiment will be performed in different  target  task  conditions  (Table  I).  In  the  standing experiment,  each  subject  will  be  instructed  to  maintain upright  standing  with  their  foots  on  the  two  robotic platforms,  one  for  each  platform,  according to  a commanded  foot  loading  shown  in  a  visual  feedback display. The display informs the subject of real-time COP and  foot  loading.  Once  the  subject  maintains  the  target posture  for  a  randomized  time  interval  of  0.52  s,  mild, random  position  perturbations  (pseudo-random  binary sequence with an amplitude of 3, a speed of 200/s, and a switch rate of 100 ms) will be applied to the ankle for 1 s. In the walking and running experiments, the subject will be instructed to walk or run over the walkway at different speeds with the guidance of a metronome. Walking and running tasks will also involve turning tasks. In order to quantify ankle stiffness throughout the stance phase of the gait, the random perturbations will be continuously applied to the ankle in the frontal plane when the foot is in contact with the ground.  In the standing experiment, a total of 15 trials will be completed in each target condition. In the walking and running experiments, a total of 30 trials will be completed in each of the 9 walking/running conditions. Among 30 trials, 15 trials will be without perturbations, which will be used not only for the purpose of system identification but also for the quantification of foot loading trajectory. In all experiments, target conditions will be block randomized. The experiment will be designed such that each block will  last  less than  10  mins, with a minimum  rest  period  of  5  mins  between blocks.  An  electrogoniometer  and  the force  plate  of  the  robotic  platform  will directly  measure  ankle  kinematics  and torques,  respectivel",

FP00027386,452,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health conditions in childhood, and nearly half of all youth with ADHD have at least one parent who also meets criteria for the disorder. Intergenerational ADHD is a significant risk factor for reduced parenting skill use and poor child outcomes following evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) programs. Given that BPT is predicated on consistent, in vivo application of learned parenting skills, efforts to reduce parental ADHD and related executive dysfunction may have a significant impact on skill use and treatment outcomes. However, few investigations have examined the effect of dual parent/child psychosocial treatment for ADHD in this subgroup. This K23 application seeks to design and preliminary test an integrated BPT program containing BPT delivery adaptations and cognitive and behavioral strategies to address parental ADHD. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) assess intervention needs and barriers and facilitators of BPT skill use among parents of children with ADHD, who also experience ADHD themselves, using Human Centered Design; 2) design and iteratively refine an integrated behavioral parenting program targeting parental ADHD and executive dysfunction (Executive Function Enhanced Caregiver Training Skills, EFECTS); and 3) conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial that assesses the feasibility of comparing EFECTS (CBT for Parental ADHD + EF Enhanced BPT) to active control components (Support Group for Parental ADHD + Standard BPT) in preparation for a fully powered, R01 application. Candidate: My early research examined the underlying executive function deficits associated with ADHD, and my long-term career goal is to design theory-driven interventions based on our understanding of the etiological underpinnings of the disorder. As treatment research represents a shift in my research interests, I require formal, mentored training in intervention design and evaluation. Through this mentored, career development award, I will learn the skills necessary to become an independent intervention researcher, including 1) methods for designing stakeholder-focused interventions, 2) experimental therapeutic approaches to intervention development, 3) RCT methodology and data analytic techniques, and 4) career development and grant writing skills. My mentorship team is well-suited to provide the training necessary for me to become a successful intervention researcher and consists of Dr. Sharlene Wolchik (primary mentor; expertise: theory-based parenting intervention development; RCT implementation), Dr. Stephen West (co-mentor; expertise: experimental design, causal inferences, program evaluation), Dr. Mary Solanto (co-mentor; expertise: designing CBT interventions for adults with ADHD and executive dysfunction), Dr. Cady Berkel (co-mentor; expertise: parent skill use measurement, qualitative research methods, augmenting interventions to increase parenting skill adherence), Dr. Linda Pfiffner (collaborator; expertise: developing BPT programs for ADHD), and Dr. Aaron Lyon (collaborator; expertise: Human Centered Design methodology).

FP00027401,453,,,,,1,,,"The growing number of bilingual children worldwide presents a challenge in education and intervention and requires re-evaluation of modules of instruction in the presence of two languages. Currently, instructional modules (mixed vs. block) have only been tested separately for different cognitive-linguistic skills within the same languages, or for the same skill across both languages, but not for multiple skills within and across both languages. The novelty of the proposed study lies in the investigation of the differential impact of two instructional modules -- block vs. mixed -- within and across the two languages of bilingual preschool children. Intervening and testing within the block module in two different language conditions (L1 first, followed by L2 vs. L2 first, followed by L1) will examine the transfer of cognitive-linguistic skills trained in one language to the other language across the four micro- and macro-communication skills. Bilingual narrative intervention will be used to target micro- and macro-communication skills at the word level (vocabulary and internal state terms), sentence level (complex sentences), and discourse level (narrative structure). Impact will be tested for immediate gains, learning curves, and retention, across the two languages. The potential contribution to the current body of research lies in the novel comparison between the different modules and conditions, for different skills and will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that enhance learning in dual language settings.

FP00027478,454,,,,,1,,,"A diverse well-trained public health worker and clinical workforce is needed to meet the current and emerging needs of MCH populations in the US. Racial/ethnic minority group members in Arizona, including American Indian/Alaska Natives, Latinos, and African Americans, face significant and persistent disparities in the areas of MCH.1 For example, the rate of maternal mortality for American Indian/Alaska Native women (284 per 100,000 live births) in 2019 was 4 times that of non-Latino White women in 2016 (Arizona Department of Health Services, 2019).  Rates of infant mortality for African Americans and American Indians/Alaska Natives are approximately twice the statewide average (5.6 per 1,000 live births). American Indian/Alaska Natives, Latinos, and African Americans are significantly more likely to experience teen pregnancy, and less likely to have access to prenatal care and preventive medical care. Greater understanding with of the causes of these health disparities, and the implementation of strategies to appropriately address health disparities in racial/ethnic minority groups is critically needed. Racial/ethnic pairing of health professionals and clients are known to reduce mistrust while simultaneously improving communication and health outcomes (Wakefield, 2014).  The current health workforce is not fully prepared to serve a fast-changing population (Gomez, 2019; Sullivan, 2004; Rhea, 2012; Stanford, 2020) particularly in the southwest where many American Indians still reside upon designated tribal native land, and where the Latino population is growing exponentially (US Census Bureau, 2019). With racial/ethnic minority group members making up 46% of the population, Arizona is on the verge of becoming a majority-minority state. In 2019, 32% of Arizonans identified as Hispanic/Latino, 5% as Black/African American, 5% as American Indian/Alaskan Native, 4% as Asian, and 3% as multiple races.4 According to HRSAs report on Sex, Race, and Ethnic Diversity of U.S. Health Occupations (2011-2015), Latinos and African Americans are significantly underrepresented in nearly all MCH occupations. To promote the diversity of health professionals and increase the cultural relevance of our research, we must do better by enhancing the diversity of and representation within our workforce.",
FP00027485,455,,,,,1,,,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the emergent and rapidly spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 [2]. Many questions about COVID-19 urgently need to be answered, including knowledge gaps regarding infection and re-infection rates, illness characterization, risk and protective factors, differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, and efficacy of interventions and vaccination when they become available. During the global public health emergency brought about by a new coronavirus, tools and infrastructure available to fill these critical gaps in knowledge and practice must be developed and implemented as quickly as possible. Older adults are among those with the highest risk for medically attended COVID-19. Characterization of risk factors and clinical epidemiology of COVID-19 among older adults may inform public health strategies to prevent infection and reduce the burden of severe disease in this population. Because older adults are particularly vulnerable to severe disease once infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus and may be prioritized for a pandemic vaccine once it is available, this population is a high priority for early studies of the incidence and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness. In addition, immune response among older adults and especially frail adults may be reduced compared to younger individuals, including more rapid waning of antibodies following infection or vaccination. A protocol unique to this population is therefore needed to obtain early and critical information about incidence of infection and illness, characterization of illness, and immune response to infection.Our primary objectives for this current proposal, the COVID-19 Illness and Testing among Retirement Communities in the US (CITRUS) study, are to: 1) estimate the cumulative incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic infection in community-dwelling older adults in the US; and 2) establish kinetics of immunity over time. Secondary objectives include describing illness severity, risk factors for infection, healthcare utilization, and immune response to vaccination and vaccine effectiveness when SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available.We will enroll approximately 1,500-2,000 participants within 3 months. Sampling of eligible participants will occur from individuals residing in independent living/assisted living facilities or residing in the community and receiving centralized care through one of the participating continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). The initial study period will be 6 months, with an option to continue data collection for an additional year. Participants enrolled in our cohort will provide respiratory and/or mucosal specimens weekly and at acute illness onset during the study period. Those specimens will be shipped to and analyzed by an approved CDC-contracted central laboratory. Participants will also complete weekly surveys tracking general health, symptoms, exposure risks, and healthcare utilization for those with symptoms or confirmed disease.

PROJECT BACKGROUND: Arizona State University (ASU) and HonorHealth are collaborating to establish a state-wide, multi-disciplinary collaborative partnership to scale education, best-care practices, and quality improvement in treating COVID-19 in Nursing Homes through Project ECHO. This ECHO program breaks down the walls between specialty and primary care by linking expert specialist teams at an academic hub with providers in nursing homes in local communities - the 'spokes' of the model. Together, they participate in weekly teleECHOTM clinics, which are like virtual grand rounds, share best practices to standardize evidence-based care, leverage case-based learning and guided practice to master complex cases, and apply web-based tools to monitor outcomes. ASU will design, implement, and maintain the ECHO program. HonorHealth will recruit subject matter experts, and provide administrative staff to support the operations of cohorts within the Nursing Home COVID-19 Action Network (CAN)ECHO.  2.  PROJECT GOALS:    Preventing COVID-19 from entering nursing homes via staff, visitors, and residents.    Should the virus enter the nursing home, preventing greater spread among patients, staff, and  visitors.     Providing best-practice care and treatment for residents who test positive for COVID-19.    Protecting staff from infection and ensuring best-practice safety measures, to help staff build confidence in their work, feel safe from infection, and support staff retention.     Ensuring that residents who are dying from COVID-19 can safely receive visitors.    3.  SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED: Establishment and ongoing operations of 2 Nursing Home CAN ECHO cohorts for continuous technical assistance for providers treating patients in nursing homes amidst COVID-19. The ECHO model, developed by the University of New Mexico, is intended to utilize web technologies to provide instruction and case consultation for a specific patient population. This medium allows for ongoing technical assistance for providers and clinicians working inside nursing homes to increase their capacity to manage patients in their community, without necessitating the need to leave ones clinical setting to participate. This platform also allows for ongoing technical assistance in quality and safety improvement efforts related to the slowing and stopping the spread of COVID-19 within facilities. This joint effort will be available at no-cost to any provider who wishes to participate and free CME credit will be available to those who are eligible. 4. GENERAL PROVISIONS/SCOPE OF WORK: a.

FP00027526,460,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARYOverview:Extreme heat causes illnesses and death, disrupts lifestyles, decreases economic activity, strains the electric power grid, and is expected to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Yet understanding of the causal pathways linking heat to adverse societal outcomes, and the associated feedbacks are poorly understood due to lack of suitable instrumentation as well as the unethical nature of conducting extreme-heat experiments on humans. The goal of this proposal is to acquire a thermal manikin system customized for high-heat and outdoor use (ASU ANDI) that will address this knowledge gap. This advanced instrument will be paired with a state-of-the-art mobile weather station developed at ASU. The unique capabilities of this platform will overcome traditional experimental barriers and enable pioneering research on fundamentals of human-environment heat exchange and multifactorial adverse impacts of heat on the human body in various urban contexts. The persistently hot climate (>6 months of over 90F) and diversity of micro-environments on Arizona State University (ASU) campus and in the surrounding urban and rural communities make an ideal outdoor lab for the proposed experiments (other climates can be simulated using ASU thermal chamber). Members of the ASU team study extreme heat impacts and mitigation strategies through various lenses, including augmentation of indoor and outdoor built environments, human behavior and physiology, bioheat transfer, and cool apparel creations. These research topics span multiple spatial scales, from novel nanomaterials to urban design, and aim to fill fundamental scientific knowledge gaps that hinder progress in adapting to extreme heat. Acquisition of the manikin will propel diverse interdisciplinary research in this field, enable research training and unique educational opportunities in eight departments across five ASU colleges, and provide many ways engaging the broader research community, stakeholders, and the general public.  Intellectual Merit:The acquisition of the customized manikin will initiate a paradigm shift in how we quantify human thermal exposure in diverse environments, particularly under oppressive heat. The advanced information on mimicked human thermoregulatory response that ASU ANDI will provide is presently not available from simulations, human trials, or current thermal manikins. The key new scientific capabilities and fundamental contributions enabled by ASU ANDI will include: 1) development of novel experimental methods (including micro-engineered functional skins) and modeling approaches to quantify conductive, convective, evaporative, and radiative human heat exposure on 35 human body zones; 2) The evaluation and improvement of indoor/outdoor thermal exposure and physiologic models under oppressive heat across climate types and personal contexts. Acquisition of the manikin will also accelerate the development of a broad range of human-centric adaptations for coping with extreme heat that not only improve human comfort, productivity, and safety but can also reduce required energy use for conditioning buildings.  Broader Impacts:ASU ANDI will lead to broader societal impacts through integrated research and education activities that emphasize the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, including female early-career faculty investigators and a transdisciplinary student body that spans undergraduates and graduates from engineering, physical sciences, design, architecture, health, fashion, and sports sciences. At least twelve undergraduate and graduate courses across various departments will use the manikin for experiential learning outdoors and in the thermal chamber. We expect to annually train between 50-100 basic users and numerous expert researchers that can become the next generation of instrumentalist. The manikin will also be leveraged to reach a general population through multimedia outreach, visits to/from local K-12 science classes, and during open house events such as the annual ASU Open Door days, advancing discovery and promoting experiential, cross-disciplinary training, learning, and communication for students across all education levels. Finally, given the diverse social, environmental, economic, and health impacts of heat, society will benefit from a broad use and dissemination of research arising from ANDI experiments, including fewer heat illnesses, improved societal well-being, decreased energy costs, evidence-based urban planning, improved heat adaptations around clothing, fashion, and design, in addition to potentially saving lives with new knowledge gained from testing within the most extreme environments.

FP00027602,463,,,,,1,,,"Genistein (Gen) and exercise (Exe) have been postulated as potential strategies to ameliorate obesity, inflammation, and gut microbiota (GM) with promising results. However, the impact of the combination of both Exe and Gen is yet to be investigated. We aimed to analyze the impacts of Exe, Gen, and their combined effects on GM and inflammation in mice after a 24-week high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFD). Fifty-seven C57BL/6 mice were randomized to control, HFD, HFD + Exe, HFD + Gen, or HFD + Exe + Gen. We will analyze the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene with Illumina MiSeq. We will use serum samples to analyze interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha. A preliminary 12-week HFD animal study showed significant higher bacterial richness in the HFD + Exe and HFD + Exe + Gen group compared to HFD. Ruminococcus was significantly more abundant after the HFD + Exe + Gen treatment when compared to all the other HFD groups. Exe + Gen resulted in serum Il-6 concentrations like that of controls. Based on our preliminary results we expect to see capacity of Exe, Gen, and their combined treatment to revert HFD-induced gut microbiota and inflammation deleterious effects after 24-week HFD.",
FP00027603,464,,,,,1,,,"Obesity, characterized by very high body fat, encompasses 42.4% of the US adult population and has become a global health problem. Obesity is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes (e.g., cancer) that increase morbidity and mortality. Even though there are genetic components to the development of obesity, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, including poor dietary patterns (i.e., high-fat, high-sugar diet: HFD) and sedentary behavior, play significant roles in the establishment of metabolic diseases. These lifestyle factors are important and offer a mechanism for inducing positive changes that may address the global obesity epidemic and associated health concerns. To design efficient lifestyle interventions to tackle the obesity epidemic, we need to understand 1) the combined effect of exercise (Exe) and diet on gut microbiota and 2) how modifying the gut microbiota by a combined dietetic and Exe treatment impacts inflammation status. A better understanding of these mechanisms can enhance our ability to develop precision-based lifestyle therapies for those suffering from various conditions associated with obesity and inflammation. This proposal is carefully designed to understand the unique and additive effects of dietary and Exe treatments for treating diet-induced obesity and will provide novel data on HFD-induced gut microbial dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. We will assess the gut microbiota from fecal pellets obtained from adult mice following an initial 12 weeks of a HFD and test the capacity of adding to the HFD, Exe, genistein, or Exe plus genistein for the following 12 weeks to revert the initial 12-weeks of HFD-induced gut microbial and inflammation alterations. We will utilize state-of-the-art technologies to examine changes in gut microbial composition and inflammatory profiles. Briefly, we will profile the gut community of microorganisms to identify key bacteria that may have been impacted by HFD and stimulated by Exe and genistein in adult mice. Exe is a novel factor still not well studied but with promising results on the modification of the gut microbiota. Genistein, a bioactive dietary ingredient, has previously been shown as an effective gut microbial modification tool in pro-inflammatory diseases. The genistein and Exe dose used in this project is equivalent to a realistic human-dose of genistein and Exe. Consequently, our data could be used as preliminary data to further test the combined treatment in a human trial.There is an urgent need to find a non-invasive and reliable approach to revert the increased body fat mass and cardiometabolic diseases associated with a Western-type diet. However, the multifactorial etiology of metabolic diseases makes finding treatment a challenge. Twenty years ago, obesity was characterized by an altered gut microbiota (GM) also known as gut dysbiosis.1 Specifically, compared to a lean population, GM in the obese population showed a decreased number of species (changes in diversity), increased energy extraction from the host diet, and increased number of pathogen species.2,3 Additionally, gut dysbiosis contributes to increased permeability in the gut, and the consequent release of bacterial-derived pro-inflammatory metabolites into the bloodstream. Ultimately, this altered GM contributes to inflammation-induced metabolic perturbances.4 Evidence suggests that bioactive nutrients (flavonoids) are promising dietary ingredients that could drive positive changes in obesity by modifying the GM which allows for increased bioavailability of these bioactive nutrients.5 Particularly, a flavonoid derived from soy, genistein (Gen), has been proposed as a potential treatment to recuperate dysbiosis in obese individuals and provide consequent health improvements.6 However, diet is not the only relevant factor modifying the GM. Recently, exercise (Exe) has gained attention as a key modulator of gut microbial diversity with consequences for health.7 In animal models, exercise impacts on GM differ from those induced by diet.8 However, the heterogeneity among the literature does not provide a clear mechanism for Exe impacts on GM.9 Therefore, further investigation is merited to understand if there is a synergistic benefit of combining both treatments to revert Western-style diet-induced GM disturbances and improve sub-sequent systemic health.Our long-term goal is to design a therapeutic lifestyle intervention to enhance the metabolic profile of obesity by restoring GM. The objective of this application is to test 12-week Gen, Exe, and Exe + Gen treatments for their ability to revert high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, GM and inflammatory disturbances. The rationale for this proposal is built on our preliminary findings indicating that when Exe and Gen administered together for 12-week prevented HFD-induced GM diversity changes in n=84 C57BL/6 adult mice. Our central hypothesis is that obesity, GM disturbances, and increased inflammation as a result of a 12-week HFD will be significantly recuperated during a subsequent 12-week HFD supplemented with Exe, Gen, or Exe + Gen. Exe + Gen will better recuperate GM and inflammation compared to Exe or Gen alone groups. The innovation lies in our investigation being the first to study Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen to revert HFD-induced detrimental effects in an animal model of obesity.Addressing the following specific aims will allow us to address the stated objective of this 24-week study in n=57 male C57BL/6J mice. 1.      To assess whether 12 weeks of Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen can revert obesity-induced GM alpha-diversity changes after feeding C57BL/6J male mice a HFD for 24 weeks. Based on literature we hypothesize that Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen groups will have the same or higher gut microbial alpha diversity when compared to control (healthy diet). Exe + Gen will exert a synergistic effect having a higher gut microbial diversity compared to Exe or Gen alone groups. The HFD group will have a significantly lower gut microbial alpha diversity.2.      To determine whether 12-weeks of Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen can revert obesity-induced GM beta-diversity after feeding C57BL/6J male mice a HFD for 24 weeks. We hypothesize that Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen groups will have similar beta-diversity compared to the control group. The HFD group will have a significantly different beta-diversity compared to control, Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen groups. 3.      To evaluate whether 12-weeks of Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen treatments can revert obesity-induced inflammation caused by a 24-week HFD in C57BL/6 male mice. We hypothesize that Exe, Gen, and Exe + Gen groups will experience revert in HFD-induced inflammation (lower Il-6, TNF-alpha, Il-10 concentrations). We expect the combined Exe + Gen treatment to significantly revert the pro-inflammatory state caused by HFD when compared to Exe or Gen treatments alone.At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to identify the role of combining Exe and Gen as a therapy to revert long-term HFD-induced gut microbial and inflammatory disturbances. We also expect to have an important positive impact in the field by providing novel data on the use of lifestyle interventions to improve the dysfunctional metabolism observed in obesity.",
FP00027604,465,,,,,1,,,"The promotion of exercise to reduce fall risk is of critical importance in the older adult population. Nearly one in three older adults experiences a fall each year. While many falls are non-injurious, nearly 20% of falls result in a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury, including traumatic brain injuries. Falls-related healthcare utilization, including ER visits (3 million per year) and hospitalizations due to hip fractures (800,000 per year), is exceedingly high resulting in exorbitant healthcare expenditures. Negative consequences of falls include an increased fear of falling, impaired physical function and disability, increased sedentary time, loss of independence, and death among older adults. Non-injurious falls may also lead to an increased fear of falling, reduced engagement in daily activities, loss of muscle mass, and an increased risk of falling. Exercise is a recommended strategy for reducing the risk of falls. Home-based interventions may be especially effective in increasing physical activity in older adults and would help address the challenges to physical exercise for home-bound older adults. There is also growing evidence that cognitive training designed to improve executive function may also improve balance and gait. We will use a game (JoiRide) that utilizes virtual reality delivered through a head-mounted display to simultaneously promote physical activity (via cycling) and cognitive stimulation. JoiRide was designed specifically for older adults. To our knowledge, this will be the first home-based study using virtual reality through a head-mounted display to promote physical activity, cognitive training, and reduce fall risk in older adults.  To assess the feasibility of the game, equipment, and intervention, our first aim is to assess adherence, acceptability of the intervention (usability and ease of use), satisfaction, and enjoyment/boredom. This will be a 6-week intervention, where participants will play the game 6 to 8 times per week (approximately 15 to 20 minutes per session). Our second aim is to identify preliminary effectiveness of the gaming intervention on cognition and physical function to design a definitive randomized control trial.",
FP00027631,466,,,,,1,,,"Research investigating the influence of policy responses to COVID-19 on older adults living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) is needed to develop a framework for primary care responsiveness. This is critical to effectively address prevention and management of chronic conditions during a public health crises. Chronic conditions are among the leading causes of death and disability and are a significant cost driver for the American healthcare system. Managing chronic conditions is challenging and has been compounded by recent constraints imposed by the COVID-19. The surge in chronic-care hospitalizations following the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak highlights the current need to identify organizational and health system factors necessary for effective chronic disease management during public health crises. The appropriate management of chronic conditions can maintain the well-being of people and contain health system spending. Based on the challenges imposed by policy responses to COVID-19, this research will examine individual patient needs and emerging organizational and health system factors that facilitate or impede access to primary care among older individuals living with MCC during public health crises. In this proposal we outline a plan to conduct a complex multi-phase mixed methods investigation that aims to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of Community Health Centers (CHCs) in Arizona by identifying those that have both high and low rates of unplanned hospitalizations and appropriate primary care visits with patients who have MCC; 2) Evaluate how the public health responses to COVID-19 in Arizona influenced primary healthcare delivery; and 3) Assess the impact that different approaches to primary care service delivery have on CHC leaders, service providers and individual patients living with MCC.

The public health impact of this work will include improvements and responsiveness for primary care delivery at the individual, organizational and health system levels.",
FP00027658,467,,,,,1,,,"Physical activity (PA) is preventive medicine and a key modifiable behavior to reduce risk of several cancers and improve physical and mental health across the lifespan. Yet, PA declines precipitously over the course of childhood, with >80% of adolescents (boys: 78%, girls: 85%) worldwide failing to achieve the recommended 60 min/day of aerobic moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Meta-analyses of youth PA interventions report a mean difference of only 1.5 to 4 min/day (accelerometer measured PA), favoring intervention over comparison groups. Critically, these improvements are insufficient to reach the recommended 60 min of MVPA per day. Another observation of these MVPA interventions is that the majority used relatively static components (educational materials or static goals) and/or often focused on only one level (individual or school). Emerging health behavior theory recognizes MVPA behavior as dynamic and unique within individuals. Connected wearables and ubiquitous smartphones facilitate measuring this variability in MVPA through intensive repeated measures and harnessing it through intensively adaptive interventions (IAIs). Unlike static interventions, IAIs have time-varying components that respond to an individuals performance and dynamic needs. Our previously tested adaptive goal (AG) setting technique for PA is an innovative example of IAIs. Immediate reinforcement (IR), or smaller, sooner incentives for goal attainment can supplement AGs, be facilitated through technology, and are hypothesized to result in greater MVPA than larger, later incentives. Combined AG+IR interventions have the potential to enhance adoption of MVPA, but are likely still not enough. Multilevel ecological models posit interplay between an individuals behavior and his/her environment that functions to facilitate or constrain PA. One hypothesis derived from ecological models is that individual-level interventions will be more effective when built environments support MVPA. Highly playable/walkable neighborhoods are hypothesized to provide a supportive environment for youth PA adoption and maintenance, enhancing the effect of individual-level interventions. No studies have yet tested a priori the premise that individual-level interventions for youth result in greater adoption and maintenance of MVPA when conducted in neighborhood environments supportive (vs. unsupportive) of physical activity. Expanding on our completed work with adults, we propose to test novel adaptive goal (AG) setting and immediate reinforcement (IR) interventions against static goals (SG) and delayed reinforcement (DR) interventions in a 4-arm, randomized factorial trial to increase MVPA among 640 insufficiently active boys and girls (13-17 years). Using GIS measures of environment (playability/walkability) and socioeconomic status (SES), we will recruit from 4 neighborhood types: high PA support/high SES, high PA support/low SES, low PA support /high SES, and low PA support/low SES. The factorial design and sampling approach allow us to test, within a multilevel framework, synergistic effects of interventions and neighborhood factors on both MVPA adoption and maintenance.",

FP00027790,470,,,,,1,,,"Speech disorders are the most prevalent form of communication disorders. Many treatments of speech dis-orders involve learning new speech behaviors or modifying abnormal speech behaviors. These treatments strongly rely on processes of speech motor learningimprovement in motor performance through practice. How-ever, speech disorders are often associated with impairments in various speech motor learning processes, resulting in inefficient or deficient speech motor learning. Inefficiencies in speech motor learning processes re-duce the effectiveness of the treatments that rely on these learning processes. Therefore, there is a critical need (1) to understand the specific contributions of each of the processes of speech motor learning and (2) to develop behavioral protocols that selectively influence various motor learning processes to improve speech motor per-formance. Without this knowledge, the promise of developing effective and optimized treatments for speech disorders will likely remain limited. This proposals overall objective is to develop behavioral protocols that se-lectively target and improve various processes of speech motor learning in healthy adults. Here, we propose a program of research to develop and optimize a set of visually augmented training protocols to improve the ac-curacy of two error-based processes crucial for successful speech motor learning: auditory error detection and auditory-to-motor mapping. Our central hypothesis is that improving error-based processes through augmented training can improve speech motor learning. We formulated this hypothesis based on current theoretical models of speech, including our recent computational model. Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of error-detection training on speech motor learning. Using visual feedback and auditory feedback perturbation, we will train subjects to detect and estimate auditory errors more accurately. Subsequently, we will evaluate subjects extent of speech motor learning. Aim 2 will determine the contributions of enhanced auditory-to-motor mapping to speech motor learning.

FP00027790_Res1,471,,,,,1,,,"Speech disorders are the most prevalent form of communication disorders. Many treatments of speech disorders involve learning new speech behaviors or modifying abnormal speech behaviors. These treatments strongly rely on processes of speech motor learningimprovement in motor performance through practice. However, speech disorders are often associated with impairments in various speech motor learning processes, resulting in inefficient or deficient speech motor learning. Inefficiencies in speech motor learning processes reduce the effectiveness of the treatments that rely on these learning processes. Therefore, there is a critical need (1) to understand the specific contributions of each of the processes of speech motor learning and (2) to developbehavioral protocols that selectively influence various motor learning processes to improve speech motor performance. Without this knowledge, the promise of developing effective and optimized treatments for speech disorders will likely remain limited. This proposals overall objective is to develop behavioral protocols that selectively target and improve speech motor learning processes in healthy adults. Here, we propose a researchprogram to develop and optimize a set of visually augmented training protocols to improve the accuracy of two error-based processes crucial for successful speech motor learning: auditory error detection and auditory-tomotor mapping. Our central hypothesis is that improving error-based processes through augmented training can improve speech motor learning. We formulated this hypothesis based on current theoretical models of speech,including our recent computational model. Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of error-detection training on speech motor learning. Using visual feedback and auditory feedback perturbation, we will train subjects to detect and estimate auditory errors more accurately. Subsequently, we will evaluate subjects extent of speech motor learning. Aim 2 will determine the contributions of enhanced auditory-to-motor mapping to speech motor learning. Using visual feedback, we will train subjects to learn the relationship between various articulatory configurations and their auditory consequences. Then, we will evaluate subjects extent of speech motor learning. This projects results will have a critical positive impact because (1) they will form a strong scientific foundation that can inform the development of effective and optimized treatments for speech disorders, and (2) they will have significant theoretical implications by elucidating error-based processes of speech motor learning.",

Mid-life is a critical window for people to improve their current functioning and enhance healthy aging, by improving emotional health and increasing physical activity (PA). People with mobility impairing disabilities may be physically unable to meet physical activity guidelines, and face additional barriers. The higher prevalence of daily stress encountered by mid-life people with mobility impairment has been linked to emotional health and cardiometabolic disease risk factors, such as excess abdominal fat that can lead to premature mortality. This is especially so for women with mobility impairment (WMI) who have higher prevalence of excess body fat, higher risk for cardiometabolic risk, and are typically not eligible for most interventions that involve vigorous PA. Our work combines two forms of low-to-moderate PA meditative movement, Tai Chi and Qigong (TCQ), in a mind-body practice described in our model, Biobehavioral Model of Effects of TCQ on Body Composition. TCQ can be completed in a seated position and has been tested in non-impaired populations, consistently showing improvements in stress related factors and associated dynamics (neurophysiological and hormonal) associated with abdominal fat in women. Changes in  stress in response to TCQ is directly observed as changes in heart rate variability and cortisol, reductions in reported emotional distress, and behavioral indicators of emotional eating and sleep quality. These all contribute to excess abdominal fat (measured as waist circumference) and strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk.

FP00027854,474,,,,,1,,,"ABSTRACT  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spurred crises in both public health and the global economy. The rapid spread of the virus around the world and the high mortality rate in vulnerable populations reflects urgency for effective therapeutics and vaccines. Currently, many old/existing drugs and technologies have been repurposed for possibly treating COVID-19 while several vaccines have been distributed throughout the world to vaccinate the general public. However, it remains uncertain if the vaccination will lead to a long-lasting protection against the virus. Given our incomplete  understanding  of  SARS-CoV-2  and  the  protective  immunity  against  this  virus,  the  search  for therapeutics and vaccines is highly dynamic and constantly evolving. Our recent demonstration of RNA-origami (RNA-OG) nanostructures as a robust and stable scaffold with intrinsic Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulatory activity highlights their potential as an engineering platform to rationally design immunotherapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Due to its ability to multivalently assemble with either neutralizing molecules or antigenic epitopes  targeted  to  different  types  of  immune  cells,  RNA-OG  based  immunotherapeutics  or  vaccines  are expected to confer higher binding avidities in their neutralization activity or effective elicitation of strong T-cell and  B-cell  immune  responses  against  SARS-CoV-2.  Moreover,  as  a  selective  TLR3  agonist,  RNA-OG administered to the respiratory airway during the early stage of the infection may increase innate immunity and modulate  inflammatory  reactions  to  minimize  SARS-CoV-2  mediated  immunopathology  in  the  lung.  Taken together,  our  RNA-OG  nanostructure  may  function  as  a  smart  engineering  platform  for  the  design  and construction of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunotherapeutics and vaccines, as it is highly adaptable, in the case  of new targets to be included to contain this pandemic or, in the future, any other infectious agents.

Metabolic measurement of over 2,500 small molecules (MW<2,000 Da) is now available in the Gu Lab on a routine basis (https://sites.google.com/a/asu.edu/arizona-metabolomics-research-center/). Metabolomics research in the Gu Lab  has  focused  on  the  development  of  advanced  analytical  tools  and  statistical  methodologies  for  profiling metabolites  and  metabolic  fluxes  in  complex  biological  mixtures,  and  their  applications  to  study  diseases, environmental  sciences,  etc.  Dr.  Gu  and  his  group  have  developed  both  targeted  and  untargeted  metabolite profiling  methods  on  3  different  platforms:  LC-MS/MS,  GC-MS,  and  LC-Orbitrap-MS,  totaling  12  different metabolite panels.  For this project, in particular, we will use LC-MS and GC-MS to measure metabolites to study the role of active  mitophagy  in  driving  prostate  cancer  progression  and  drug  resistance.  We  will  use  pathway  specific targeted LC-MS/MS protocols for the detection of over 320 aqueous metabolites located in 35 different metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, pentose phosphate shunt, as well as amino acid, fatty acid, and nucleic acid metabolism, etc. Furthermore, we will use LC-MS and GC-MS for untargeted aqueous metabolite profiling and lipidomics profiling.

In such everyday social interactions, tone is crucial; how it said (emotional prosody) is critical, while what is said (lexical-semantic meaning) carries less information, or is even misleading. It is easy to imagine how a misperception of the emotion in the teenagers voice might jeopardize the entire communication. Our everyday interactions are full of such exchanges, in which prosodic cues form a second channel of information transmission, beyond the meanings of the words themselves.Among a number of covarying acoustic cues to emotional prosody, voice pitch is primary, while loudness, duration, etc. are secondary. This proposal is concerned with how the cochlear implant (CI), a neural prosthesis for the deaf, conveys emotions to CI patients. The CI largely succeeds in communicating what is said to patients, but transmits voice pitch inadequately, resulting in poor perception of how it was said, thus impacting vocal emotion perception. Even when visual cues are available, CI patients exhibit deficits in audiovisual integration for emotion perception. In children with CIs, significant deficits in their production of spoken emotions have also been reported. Unfortunately, voice pitch cues are not addressed in the design of CI speech processors, and prosody is not currently emphasized in CI rehabilitation protocols. Misidentifying others spoken emotions, or having difficulty in producing emotions that others can readily identify, can limit social development in children and social interactions in adults, leading to isolation and reduced self-esteem, with lifelong negative impact. Our long-term goal is to improve emotional communication by CI patients.Large, unexplained intersubject variability has been found in CI patients emotion identification and in emotions produced by children with CIs. Lack of knowledge about the sources of such variability presents a significant barrier to progress in CIs. Here, we specifically focus on the acoustic cues to emotion and how they are used by individual CI patients for emotional communication. Specific factors such as the presence of acoustic hearing at birth, earlier or later implantation, and longer or shorter experience with the device may alter CI patients ability to utilize primary and secondary cues, both for perception and for production of emotional prosody. In this application, we propose to test the novel mechanistic hypothesis that predictors of emotion identification and production by CI patients  such as how long they have had their device (duration of device experience), their age at implantation and their access to residual acoustic hearing -- act by changing the relative use of primary/secondary acoustic cues (cue-weighting) by the individual patient. The sources of variability in cue-weighting for vocal emotion perception and production likely differ between pre-lingually deaf children (who were born with significant hearing loss) and post-lingually deaf adults (who lost their hearing as teenagers or adults) with CIs. Prosody plays a central role in infant communication, much earlier than the emergence of spoken words. Therefore, early access to acoustic input, or early implantation that allows adaptation to the degraded input within the sensitive period, may be crucial for prosodic communication by children with CIs. Post-lingually deaf adult CI patients have the advantage of prior linguistic resources developed with good acoustic hearing, but they may have to cope with age-related declines in sensory coding and in cognition. Finally, while pediatric CI recipients show deficits in emotion productions, post-lingually deaf CI patients show excellent production of emotional prosody, suggesting that the motor patterns learned with acoustic hearing are retained in deafness, despite the degraded auditory input with CIs. Our hypotheses are: [H1] that cue-weighting accounts significantly for inter-subject variations in vocal emotion identification by CI users; [H2] that optimization of cue-weighting patterns is the mechanism by which predictors such as the duration of device experience and age at implantation benefit vocal emotion identification; and [H3] that in children with CIs, perceptual cue-weighting, together with early auditory experience (e.g., age at implantation and/or presence of usable hearing at birth) account significantly for inter-subject variation in emotional productions. Our two Specific Aims will test these hypotheses while taking into other factors such as aging in adults, cognitive status, and psychophysical sensitivity to individual prosodic cues.

FP00027976,481,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  The results of phase III randomized clinical trials (RCT) suggest that the top COVID-19 vaccines have an efficacy > 90%. However, their effectiveness, measured in an uncontrolled, real world setting, is unknown. In addition, key mutations, particularly in the viruss spike protein, have produced lineages which have brought concern over potential increases in transmissibility as well as decreases in vaccine effectiveness (VE). Like the influenza vaccine, it is expected that the COVID-19 vaccines will need to be updated periodically, and thus, VE will need to be continuously estimated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that they will take advantage of their existing influenza networks to estimate the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine as well as new initiatives including COVID-NET and v-safe. Though significant, these efforts have limitations. For example, the flu VE studies run only at participating clinics in five states, and, each year, enroll around 10,000 participants as part of a test-negative design. This provides a limited number of geographic regions and participants.  While social media (SM) and search engine data has been used as a source for flu or influenza-like-illness (ILI) case monitoring and more recently, for COVID-like-illness (CLI), this is not sufficient for calculating VE, which requires longitudinal mining of cohort data for the test-negative design. We propose to use automated methods to identify a large cohort of Twitter users that report getting a COVID-19 vaccine or test, and capture their tweets over time to determine vaccination status (whether they got both doses, for example, or which vaccine they took), COVID-19 test results, and demographic information (age, gender, place of residence).  In Aim 1, we will develop and evaluate an NLP framework for selecting cohorts of SM users posting in English or Spanish that will account for rigor and reproducibility for calculation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. We will deploy a novel SM mining NLP pipeline and take advantage of our existing ongoing collection of COVID-19 from the Twitter API. Users that meet our inclusion criteria will constitute our COVID-19 VE cohort, subsets of which are used in scenarios for COVID-19 VE calculation in Aim 2.  In Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate a real-time VE estimation system that uses longitudinal SM data and accounts for biases, uncertainty, and missing data in vaccination status or COVID-19 diagnosis. We will establish a test-negative design model akin to those used by the CDC using SM data, and produce estimates of vaccine-specific and age-adjusted VE.  If successful, this will be the first automated approach to near real-time estimation of COVID-19 VE, providing a viable, relatively low-cost complementary solution to a significant public health initative.

FP00028001,482,,,,,1,,,"Zeaxanthin is a fat-soluble, oxygenized carotenoid and is inversely associated with chronic inflammation-related diseases in humans, such as type 2 diabetes. The role of zeaxanthin in the immune response and inflammation has not been well elucidated in the on-set of diabetes. Epidemiological studies stated that the circulatory zeaxanthin level is below the recommendation in the US population. This low zeaxanthin level can be caused by a limited intake in American diets, low absorption efficiency in the small intestine, and overtaken up into adipose tissues in obese diabetic human subjects. Further, the majority of dietary zeaxanthin reach the large intestine prior to excretion in the feces. However, there are outstanding questions not ever been addressed. Are these non-absorbed zeaxanthins beneficial to gut health and contributing to the immune system homeostasis in humans? If so, what is the mechanism of action of non-absorbed zeaxanthin in the colon? In our recent publications and preliminary studies, we demonstrated that dietary astaxanthin and zeaxanthin alter the colonic microbiome composition, fecal and plasma metabolomes, gene markers of regulatory T (Treg) cell activation in mice. Treg cells are necessary for the maintenance of immune self-tolerance and homeostasis. As such, the objective of this project is to determine whether increased intake of zeaxanthin enhances the host immunity by promoting gut microbiome homeostasis in healthy and obese diabetic mice. We hypothesize that dietary zeaxanthin will effectively reduce local and systemic inflammation, improve the immune system function in obese diabetic mice; this effect is mediated by the gut microbes. We also determine the extent to which zeaxanthin exerts the anti-inflammatory role through regulating the metabolism and function of Treg cells resulting from increases in butyrate production. The results from this research are expected to have a significant impact on public health by providing mechanistic investigation in Treg cells function through modulating the gut microbiome homeostasis and butyrate production. Thus, this research will fundamentally advance our understanding of carotenoids, such as zeaxanthin, to promote healthy food selection, e.g., zeaxanthin-enriched foods, especially in high-risk populations.  Dr. Haiwei Gu and his group at ASU will perform metabolomics studies in the proposed projects. Metabolic measurement of over 2,500 small molecules (MW<2,000 Da) is now available in the Gu Lab on a routine basis (https://sites.google.com/a/asu.edu/arizona-metabolomics-research-center/). Metabolomics research in the Gu Lab has focused on the development of advanced analytical tools and statistical methodologies for profiling metabolites and metabolic fluxes in complex biological mixtures, and their applications to study diseases, environmental sciences, etc. Dr. Gu and his group have developed both targeted and untargeted metabolite profiling methods on 3 different platforms: LC-MS/MS, GC-MS, and LC-Orbitrap-MS, totaling 12 different metabolite panels. For this project, in particular, Dr. Gus group will use untargeted and targeted GC/LC-MS metabolite profiling approaches to study the role of xanthophylls in gut microbiome homeostasis and Treg cell activation. Furthermore, Dr. Gu will collaborate with Dr. Dingbo Li (PI) at Oklahoma State University, especially on experimental design, data collection, and statistical data analysis.

FP00028010,483,,,,,1,,,"Sensorimotor control networks are the engines of action, including for speech and language. They have been argued to form the basis of working memory, modulate aspects of perception and comprehension, and when damaged have been linked to a range of language-related disorders including aphasia, apraxia of speech, dyslexia, and developmental stuttering. Yet, little is known about sensorimotor networks for speech, particularly regarding those in and around the planum temporale (PT) region. In this proposal, we will shine spotlights from multiple angles on this enigmatic and critically important cortical zone for speech and language function with the ultimate goal of developing truly game-changing therapeutic advances for the treatment of aphasia. AIM 1: Map auditory-motor circuits for speech production using targeted fMRI studies. We propose to use multiple paradigms to map auditory-motor speech/language circuits from converging perspectives. Altered auditory feedback paradigms allow us to target online auditory-motor error and correction signals directly for laryngeal (F0/pitch), supralaryngeal (F1/vowel), and in addition will study altered lexical-level feedback to test our prediction of posterior parietal involvement at this level. We also use a more standard listen-repeat paradigm but separate pitch from phonological components with representational similarity analysis. We predict this work will identify subnetworks involved in auditory-motor vocal control. AIM2: Delineate functional and anatomical connectivity networks. Human connectome data affords an opportunity to map cortical connectivity with unprecedented resolution. We use a novel analysis pipeline to identify connectivity patterns in and around the PT region and to test our hypothesis of the existence of multiple subnetworks, even within the PT. We then apply decoding analysis, using a meta-analysis of the functional activation literature, to attach functional significance to the networks we identify. The connectivity patterns we map, along with their decoded functions, will then be studied in relation to functional activation and lesion findings under the other Aims. AIM 3: Assess the causal involvement of auditory-motor circuits for speech using stroke. Finally, we use the lesion method to test our prediction that damage to the identified networks will cause deficits in a core set of abilities. We focus on feedback control using F0 and F1 shift, laryngeal control by developing our melody repetition and related tasks, and use data-driven analysis of speech and language ability in conduction aphasia to identify subtypes of sensorimotor deficits and their lesion correlates.",

FP00028024,485,,,,,1,,,"Minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) receive less in- and out-patient care and are less likely to receive evidence-based, guideline recommended speech and language therapy (SLT) because our best therapies are inaccessible. The PI has been developing Startle Adjuvant Rehabilitation Therapy (START), a tele-enabled, low-cost treatment that accelerates therapy outcomes in individuals with stroke  in particular individuals with severe stroke. START is the application of a startling, acoustic stimulus (via headphones) administered in conjunction with traditional therapy. Distinct from other auditory treatments (e.g. metronome), START represents endogenous activation of the cortico-reticular system that increases the intensity of practice leading to faster therapy outcomes. While studied extensively in the upper limb, STARTs impact on communication disorders has never been evaluated.  OBJECTIVE: Determine if START can be used to improve speech production impairments in chronic stroke survivors with aphasia and/or apraxia. PRELIMINARY DATA: Individuals with severe-to-moderate aphasia/apraxia completed a remotely delivered, 3-day training with START. Aphasia Quotient (AQ) more than doubled under START (7.5%) compared to Control (2.7%) [statistics in Research Strategy]. AQ was bolstered by increased Auditory Verbal Comprehension (START: 7.4%; Control: 3.4%), Repetition (START: 15.6%; Control: 4.91), and Naming & Word Finding (START: +17.4%; Control: -7.0%). Training with START also doubled Apraxia measures of more accurate multi-syllable repetitions (Diadochokinetic Rate  START: 38.5%; Control: 17.7%) and reduced errors in words of increasing length (START: -36.6%; Control: -17.7%). Changes in Aphasia and Apraxia measures resulted in striking subject-reported increases in quality of life (Stroke Impact Scale START: 12.8%; Control: 0.7%). These preliminary results indicate that START may prove to be a valuable, adjuvant tool to accelerate training effects in individuals with aphasia/apraxia. We propose a Phase 1 clinical trial on a larger cohort of 54 subjects with the goals of establishing that START can enhance functional (Aim 1) and quantitative (Aim 2) measures of speech.  IMPACT: Our best evidence-based therapies (e.g., high-intensity/ high-dose SLT) and our emerging rehabilitation technologies (e.g., TMS) are inaccessible to those who need them most because they are expensive and require in-person delivery. This proposal is significant because START addresses disparity by 1) targeting individuals with severe disability, which disproportionally affects low SES and minority groups, and 2) is tele-enabled reducing out-of-pocket patient expenses related to treatment and transportation. This study will set the stage for larger trials to establish the effectiveness of START to be incorporated into traditional SLT and as well as patient compliance, adherence, and tolerance  particularly in low SES groups.

FP00028032,486,,,,,1,,,"Our project SCH: Precision Tracking of Alzheimers Disease with Causal Machine Learning (PIs: Hahn, Berisha; Arizona State University) will develop a novel methodology for sensitively tracking Alzheimers disease (AD). Neurological disorders such as AD are the top cause of disabilities in later life, but efforts to develop effective therapies are hamstrung by an inability to monitor patients disease status accurately. Machine learning algorithms applied to modern digital sensor data promise a cost-effective and convenient solution to disease-tracking; however, tracking metrics based on supervised machine learning are apt to pick up non-causal patterns that are inappropriate for disease monitoring. Furthermore, machine learning approaches trained on conventional diagnoses can never outperform these manifestly imperfect clinical labels.By developing machine learning algorithms that specifically target causality, without the use of clinical labels, the proposed research will discover precision disease-tracking metrics for AD. We address the inherent unobservability of the neurological disease state by using the causal graph formalism to define a latent neurological construct in relation to observed data. Analyzing this causal context leads to a procedure for causally-denoising downstream behavioral metrics, based on synergistically exploiting a variety of data (e.g. imaging, behavioral, social and demographic, environmental data). We will develop the computational foundations of this causal machine learning adjustment framework in service of designing a metric for disease-tracking that varies measurably as a causal consequence of disease progression, and very little as a consequence of factors unrelated to disease.",

FP00028037,488,,,,,1,,,"Background: Low-income and dual language learners (DLLs) need efficacious oral language interventions to close their academic achievement gaps compared with their peers from higher SES and monolingual backgrounds. The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of story time language intervention that uses embodied principles through drama-based instruction (DBI). We hypothesize that including DBI strategies during story time will result in significant positive effects for the intervention group than the attentional control group (traditional shared book reading). The DLLs will show greater storytelling and comprehension gains than their monolingual peers. Further, we hypothesize that children in DBI will demonstrate greater emotional knowledge and the teachers participating in DBI will use more DBI strategies after observing the intervention.Method: The Preschool Intervention for Embodied Storytelling (PIES) project will address storytelling skills amongst at-risk students by implementing a DBI program in a Head Start program in the southwestern United States. We will measure 80 students storytelling and comprehension skills before and after implementing the PIES intervention across 6 classrooms. Teaching Artists will deliver all the lessons twice weekly classroom teachers will be active participants in the lessons.Analyses: We will compare the intervention and control groups story comprehension and retell ability, and their emotional knowledge, using multilevel repeated measures ANCOVAs. Intervention and control groups will be randomized at the classroom level. We will also examine teachers use of drama strategies before and after PIES is implemented in their classrooms using a repeated measures ANOVA. Finally, we will compare teachers survey responses at pre and posttest regarding their feelings about the use of drama-based strategies.Implications/Conclusions: Our results will advance knowledge on the role of embodied DBI in language development and teacher use of these strategies in the classroom.",
FP00028050,489,,,,,1,,,"Black adults are 20% more likely to report serious psychological distress (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) and greater stressful life events compared to white adults. Racial discrimination is a significant source of stress among Black adults, contributes to psychological distress, and may in part explain mental health disparities. Black adults lack access to quality mental health care and only one-third who need treatment actually receive it. The compounding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may further exacerbate mental health disparities and access to mental health care. Reducing psychological distress and increasing access to mental health care for Black adults is a public health emergency. Commercially available mindfulness meditation mobile apps may be an effective and efficient solution because they improve psychological distress, are highly scalable and have the potential to increase access to care (80% of Black adults own a smartphone). However, the representation of Black adults among their user base is low and most apps are not culturally tailored (i.e., include groups unique experiences, values, and beliefs). Studies suggest that mindfulness meditation programs need to be culturally tailored to encourage participation among racial/ethnic minority populations.This K01 is a mixed methods research project in collaboration with an industry partner (i.e., the Calm app) and will be conducted in three phases (development, optimization, feasibility). The goal of Aim 1 is to develop a culturally tailored version of the Calm app (Calm+) for Black adults. Guided by a social ecological/contextual framework, we will conduct focus groups to examine cultural norms, instructor diversity, culturally sensitive language, etc. of the Calm app, perceptions of meditation apps, factors contributing to adherence/engagement, barriers/facilitators, recruitment strategies, and perceived impact on psychological distress. Feedback will be used following Barrera et al., 2013 five step approach to culturally tailor the Calm app (Calm+). The goal of Aim 2 is to optimize Calm+ in Black adults using an iterative beta-testing process. Black adults (N=15) will use Calm+ for two weeks and complete an exit interview. A semi-structured interview guide will examine satisfaction/enjoyment, overall cultural congruence of the app, factors contributing to adherence/engagement, and perceived barriers/facilitators and impact on psychological distress and race-related stress. Feedback will be used to make additional iterations to Calm+. Finally, the goal of Aim 3 is to determine the feasibility of Calm+. We will recruit 40 Black adults with elevated stress (=15 Perceived Stress Scale-10 score) who will be randomized to use Calm+ (N=20) or a health education podcast app (N=20, time and attention matched control) for four weeks. Psychological distress and race related stress will be measured at pre-post. A post-survey (acceptability/demand) will assess satisfaction, intent to continue use, perceived appropriateness, and actual use (duration). We will evaluate pre-post change and between group differences in psychological distress (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21) and race-related stress (Index of Race-Related Stress) to identify any trends in change and if they are in the expected directions.

FP00028055,490,,,,,1,,,"Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever, VF) is an infection caused by Coccidioides spp., fungi endemic to the southwestern and western United States. Although their precise ecological niche is not known, they grow as mycelia in the soil. Single-celled arthroconidia from mycelia become airborne and are inhaled into the lungs, where the organism undergoes a profound metamorphosis to the spherule growth form. The infection can be asymptomatic and result in long-lived immunity, or occur as a pneumonia difficult to distinguish from community-acquired bacterial infection. In a small but significant number of cases, infection manifests outside the thoracic cavity; such extrathoracic dissemination results in significant morbidity, long-term antifungal therapy, and sometimes in death.Maricopa County in central Arizona is the home of Phoenix, the fifth largest city in the United States. It has by far the largest number of reported cases of coccidioidomycosis in the United States. Mayo Clinic Arizona (MCA) and Arizona State University (ASU), both located in Maricopa County, have a 10-year history of collaboration in the area of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever, VF). MCA healthcare providers treat over 1,000 VF patients a year; MCA is a major referral center for VF. ASU has several faculty whose laboratories study various aspects of VF.  Four of those faculty, Drs. Bean, Gu, Magee and Lake, actively collaborate with Mayo investigators, Drs. Blair, Ampel, Grys, Kaleta, and Dasari, in the area of VF. The U19 Coccidioidomycosis Collaborative Research Centers (CCRC) funding opportunity is an ideal mechanism to support their ongoing collaboration. Ten Mayo and ASU investigators have teamed up to form the Mayo/ASU Valley Fever Research Center (MAVReC). A major challenge in VF has been establishing diagnosis and predicting prognosis. One particular difficulty has been differentiating VF pneumonia from other community-acquired pneumonias. While current tests for fungal antibody responses (serology) are useful, they frequently lack sensitivity and specificity particularly early in presentation. It is important to establish a diagnosis prior to treatment. Moreover, there are no laboratory tests that are helpful at predicting outcome, particularly with regard to the development of extrathoracic dissemination. Detection of unique volatiles, metabolites, or proteins produced by the spherule phase of the fungus offers a novel and singular approach to establishing both diagnosis and prognosis. The overall objective of MAVReC is to apply state-of-the-art multi-omics (breathomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) to survey the landscape of volatiles, metabolites, and proteins secreted by Coccidioides spp. in breath, plasma, and urine in humans. The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will analyze each -omic profile and assign diagnostic and prognostic signatures to these volatiles, metabolites, and proteins/peptides.

FP00028162,491,,,,,1,,,"The concept of surveillance for infectious disease is not new. Various systems have been developed to accomplish this, but none allow a comprehensive picture in time and location of the status of all types of infectious disease across the country. We have developed a method of biosurveillance based on measuring the molecular recognition profile of antibodies in serum and using this in combination with machine learning we can create a detailed immune map of the populations reaction to all pathogen protein sequences. The mapping is performed using peptide arrays consisting of >105 peptides whose amino acids sequences are nearly random. Antibodies in serum applied to the arrays bind to the peptides and a machine learning algorithm is used to relate amino acid sequence to antibody binding. Surprisingly, the resulting neural networks can predict with high statistical accuracy how antibodies in each serum sample will bind to ANY peptide sequence, even though the arrays contain only a very sparse sample of the roughly trillion possible peptide sequences. The resulting immune equation can be applied to all pathogen proteomes giving a measure of the reactivity to each. We propose to use the network of US blood banks, in conjunction with Creative Testing Solutions based in Tempe, Arizona (who tests 38% of the US blood supply), to create a map detailing the changing immune reactivity to all pathogens around the country as a function of time. Notably, this approach has ability to detect infections from completely new pathogens by detecting common patterns of reactivity that emerge in multiple members of the population. The system is also set up to learn; as outbreaks occur and patterns are associated with specific pathogens, this information will be fed into the system providing increasingly better pathogen resolution.

FP00028240,493,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARYOverview:The proposed NRT will train the next generation sensor and machine scientists, engineers and innovators. The program will produce graduates poised to innovate and lead the development novel sensor and machine learning algorithms, and software for mobile health and IoT systems. The program is based on the premise that next generation health monitoring technologies targeting disease prevention will reduce health care cost. Sensing and cloud computing capabilities of mobile platforms are creating game changing environments for innovation in health applications. A significant drawback is the lack of precision in emerging off-the-shelf mobile health products and apps. Advances in synergistic sensor and algorithm design are key to improving precision in mobile health analytics.  This convergence NRT will train students in Integrated Design of Sensors and Machine Learning (SensMACH) for Health monitoring systems. SensMACH students will innovate and advance monitoring technologies requiring understanding of challenges at the overlap of sensor design, big data, machine learning (ML), biomedical information management, and associated social implications, ethics and policies. Convergence research is included in all education and research components of this NRT. Several of the new courses will be co-taught and all research projects will contain tasks from two or more disciplines with co-advising teams. This diverse  NRT team includes distinguished fellows, faculty leaders and CAREER award winners who lead major centers in sensors, circuits, signal processing, engineering education, communications, ethics and social sciences. Multidisciplinary plans of study along with a fully integrated innovation centric laboratory sequence that includes creating prototypes in our NRTs Sensor Innovation Studio enable our graduates to invent and patent new AI-enabled sensor and monitoring systems.  The total number of trainees to receive a NRT stipend will be 28. The number of students not receiving a stipend will be 32 for a grand total of 60  NRT trainees. The program will serve both Masters (20%) and Doctoral students (80%). Keywords: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), AI-enabled sensors, Mobile Health  Intellectual Merit:Inexpensive sensors are required for mobile health monitoring and IoT systems. To improve precision and analytics, sensor design must be accompanied by an array of corrective algorithms. This requires integrative multidisciplinary research that bridges the gap between sensor design and machine learning algorithm development. This innovation-centric NRT will train sensor circuit designers that also understand machine learning capabilities and produce algorithm developers that are well aware of sensor design challenges. An interdisciplinary plan will prepare Masters and Doctoral students for industry, academic, and entrepreneurial careers. The NRT team developed a unique innovation-centric NRT plan of study with student pathways that span technology (sensor science), diagnostics (DSP, informatics, big data), innovation preparation (patents, prototypes)  and policy (ethics, social implications, privacy), with emphasis on leadership in innovation and entrepreneurship. Curriculum innovations include four NRT specific courses that will be developed to support the NRT curriculum. NRT dissertation topics on convergence research include: a) integrated sensor device and ML b) big data, c) biomedical information management, d) flexible circuits and sensors, e) quantum machine learning,  and f) cross-cutting topics with emphasis in communications, ethics and policy.  Broader Impacts:The NRT includes research experiences, crosscutting modules, training workshops and seminars in: public speaking, policy, standards, ethics, and outreach.  Synergies of the NRT team with ASU Skysong Innovations and the ASU-Maricopa MedTech Ventures will provide structured training in prototyping, patents, entrepreneurship, and SBIR planning.  The NRT plans of study embed a Sensor Innovation Studio experience which will energize, empower and enable students to create and patent socially relevant prototypes from their research. The SensMACH team will create an NRT certificate with the long term plan to establish  sustainable degree concentrations. Our recruitment plan is enriched by including an array of processes that will specifically engage programs at a HBCU, Navajo nation, Hispanic-serving institutions, and women in engineering programs.  A diversity and inclusivity culture will be promoted throughout the NRT activities including participation in sensor innovation and entrepreneurship activities, workshop and professional development and access to resources.  Strong industry engagement through established industry-university centers (IUCRC) will provide internship opportunities and industry mentorship and assessment.

FP00028268,494,,,,,1,,,"As technologies with expanded capabilities for data collection, storage, interoperation, and analytics become widely available, the risk-work -- defined as working practices framed by risk -- done by emergency services will substantially transform. Most U.S. cities are served by All-Hazards Fire Departments, staffed by personnel who provide a range of emergency services to address and prevent medical, community health, and safety emergencies. Traditionally, fire personnel rely on a combination of expert systems, organizational processes, and professional intuition honed through experience to identify and mitigate the risks they are tasked with handling. They do so through multiple risk-work practices, including scanning for risks, translating generalized risk knowledge into specific contexts, and managing risks. Faced with continuous increases in 911 calls and a shortage of resources, fire departments are expected to transform their current intuition-based practices of risk management into data intensive practices where future risks can be recognized and handled before they occur using data-driven technologies. These emerging data tools offer potential to augment risk management at individual, organizational, and institutional levels. Yet, designing data driven risk-work systems requires deep understanding of current risk practices in emergency work, and potential future impacts on labor (e.g., increased data work), workers (e.g., increased disparities in risk knowledge), and communities (e.g., intensified surveillance of marginalized/at-risk populations). This project has multiple goals, including comprehensive empirical exploration of risk-work performed by fire personnel, development of a design process for the future of emergency services risk-work, co-designing speculative data-driven tools for risk-work with fire departments/fire personnel, and developing a sociotechnical theory of risk-work. Wewill achieve these goals in three phases. First, we will document current practices of risk-work and risk relevant data resources using in-depth ethnographic research in four fire departments in different contexts across the U.S. Second, we will co-design speculative prototypes for data-driven risk-work tools and practices with our study participants. Third, we will share our speculative prototypes with a broad emergency services audience at a national conference to foster conversations around the future of riskwork and understand how the speculative designs shift visions of the future for emergency services. Intellectual MeritThe proposed research will produce rich empirical insights about the under-developed ontology and dynamics of risk-work, including how risk-work plays out in everyday practice, the role of tacit knowledge in managing risk, and the institutional shaping of risk-work as data-driven tools and logics are incorporated into risk-work. Second, this project will develop a design process for shaping the future of risk-work that bridges the disciplines of participatory design, speculative design, ethnography, computing,and information science. Third, this work will result in creation of speculative prototypes for future data-driven risk-work, advancing speculative design as a methodology to provoke conversations and insights about ethical innovation that can be utilized to design preferred futures incorporating data driven IT into risk-work broadly. Finally, the proposed research will thus result in the development of a sociotechnical theory of risk-work using abductive methods that draw on empirical data to provoke and extend theory. Broader ImpactEmergency services are key to the health, safety, and security of individuals, communities, and society. Thus, research that will help this critical profession is primed to provide lasting, practical benefits. This research will directly benefit the study sites and the populations they serve since insights drawn from ethnographic research will be distributed to study sites and participants. Co-designed speculative prototypes for risk-work will be disseminated to the emergency service professional community toinfluence the use and design of future risk mitigating technologies. In so doing, this work will likely impact a wide range of emergency services beyond our study sites and can potentially benefit all populations they serve. The future of data intensive, risk-oriented work practices will manifest in a broad array of public and private sectors, such as education, social services, and medicine; the insights gained through our work are poised to influence the future of risk-work conducted in these domains as well.",

FP00028308,496,,,,,1,,,"Getting the Edge on Data-Driven Self-Managed Care:  A focus on Older Veterans in Arizona The rapid growth of our aging population causes tremendous social and economic challenges. Older adults are more likely  to  confront  chronic health conditions,  physical  pain, sleep difficulties,  depression,  and  memory  concerns, compounded by the stress of managing these conditions. Support may not be available, especially for those living alone;  even  for  those  with  support,  the  desire  for  independence  and  to  not  be  a  burden  on  others  can  lead  to postponing getting help until a problem is dire. The increasingly available smart and low-cost Internet of Things (IoTs), particularly wearables and smart home IoTs, offer important opportunities for providing not only continuous monitoring  of  an  older  adults  cognitive,  social,  emotional,  and  health  indicators  but  also  real-time  alerts  and recommendations to the user for self-management of care. Existing solutions support only scattered data collection with primitive interfaces, and cannot satisfy the health and social care needs of our seniors considering their health, mobility, privacy, and cost constraints. Solutions are needed that go beyond a focus on activities of daily living to create ways for older adults to thrive, connect, contribute to, and shape their communities. Innovations require user-informed designs that account for dynamically-changing complexities at individual, social, and cultural levels.  This planning project aims to build a multidisciplinary team including academic researchers with complementary expertise  (IoT  and  edge  computing,  big  data,  machine  learning,  privacy  and  security,  human  factors,  human-computer  interaction,  psychology,  gerontology,  health  policy)  and  community  stakeholders  (seniors  and  their families,  community  service  providers,  healthcare  providers,  government  agencies)  to  understand  the  unique challenges and form a research agenda for developing and deploying a data-driven, IoT-based solution for providing high quality, low cost, and socially-relevant self-managed care.  The study will focus on the older veteran populations in Arizona. Arizona is one of the top two states in the nation for retiree relocation; nearly one-fourth of Arizonas 7.3M residents are 60 years or older. Arizonas older adult population includes many vulnerable subgroups (e.g., low-income, ethnic minority, rural), where social, health and economic concerns are amplified. Military Veterans (approximately 15% of older adults) face unique challenges (e.g., more disabilities, mental health diagnoses, pain medication prescriptions), arguably as a microcosm of the perfect storm of challenges that may confront older adults. Thus, older Veterans are an important use case for developing and testing IoT-related solutions. Intellectual  Merit.  The  project  will  lay  the  groundwork  for  innovations  in  1)  real-time  and  privacy-preserving learning  systems  which  employ  IoTs  and  edge  computing  to  support  learning  on  live,  personal  health  data  and provide  real-time,  personalized  feedback  to  users  without  sharing  private  information  with  any  third  party;  2) heterogeneous data integration and learning techniques which utilize heterogeneous and weakly labeled IoT data for self-supervised learning to detect emergency, emergent, transitional, and long-term changes in users physical, social, and cognitive states and support prevention and early intervention;  3) human-systems engineering  which  effectively integrates health information and delivery systems to meet the different needs of older adults, and allow them to more effectively take charge of their health; 4) social, cognitive-, and affective processes including the roles of  user  awareness/insight,  self-efficacy/agency,  and  social  connection  in  memory,  information  processing,  and decision-making; and 5) healthcare policy and health system structures that can impact on health management. Broader Impact. The projects use-inspired foci will have, individually and collectively, immense socio-economic impacts. Through community building and other outreach activities (e.g., focus groups), the project will collect and integrate input from (a) older adult veterans, (b) their families and caregivers, and (c) support organizations and residential community directors, and will organize an interdisciplinary community that brings together (d) data and computer  scientists  and  engineers;  (e)  domain  scientists/engineers  and  policy  experts;  (f)  public  and  private healthcare facility and government personnel; (g) industry and nonprofits; and (h) educators. This community will serve as a nexus for major research collaborations that will overcome key research barriers and explore and catalyze new  paradigms  and  practices;  enable  development  and  sharing  of  sustainable  and  reusable  technologies  and repositories coupled with extensive broader dissemination activities; act as a key national resource for public policy guidance on relevant strategies and regulations; and provide education, broadening participation, and workforce development at all levels (K-12 to postgraduate) for the next generation of scientists, engineers, and practitioners. Through close collaboration with local communities, the projects outcome will immediately benefit Arizonas large population of older veterans, with the potential to also impact broadly for aging populations in the U.S., by providing  1 high-quality,  cost-effective  self-managed  care  which  can  broaden  and  transform  the  concept  of  age-friendly systems and communities.    2 What forms of collaboration do we need from our external partners? The external partners will contribute to the project in multiple ways, including participation in regular (online) workshops and working groups to help       identify short- and long- term research and development needs and recommend research initiatives; identify additional stakeholders and communities and methods for engagement; recommend data collections for conducting the research and metrics for evaluating its success; identify results to be transferred to the stakeholders and to recommend technology transfer mechanisms to enable this transfer in an on-going and timely manner; recommend future changes in the projects goals and objectives; and identify potential new partners and promote the project both within and outside their own organizations.  3 ",
FP00028315,497,,,,,1,,,"This renewal application proposes continued study of dynamic sound-source localization. A core function of the brain is to create an internal representation of the surrounding world. As both listeners and nearby objects move, sensory information changes, and the brain must update and maintain this representation so that it remains stable. Humans and most other animals can locate sound sources in the world around them based on just their sounds, allowing listeners to successfully navigate and communicate in an ever-changing acoustic world. Many hearing-impaired listeners have difficulty accurately locating sound sources in a complex dynamic acoustic world. Using the unique ability to rotate sound sources and listeners in a sound field, the previous grant-supported research confirmed the hypothesis that locating sound sources in a real-world sound field (world-centric sound-source localization) requires a multisensory, multisystem combination of information regarding auditory-spatial cues used to determine head-centric sound-source location (i.e., interaural cues of time and level differences, and spectral cues) and information about the position of listeners heads (world-centric head position). Head-position information could be provided by a number of neural systems (vision, vestibular, proprioceptive, somatosensory, auditory, and experience/memory). Based on a descriptive model developed during the previous grant period and the results we obtained, this application proposes three Specific Aims to better understand world-centric sound source localization by normal and hearing-impaired listeners:Aim 1: Investigate the use of sensory information to inform head-centric auditory-spatial estimates and convert them into world-centric auditory-spatial estimates. Many proposed experiments will investigate confusions listeners often have in distinguishing the location of sound sources in front versus those in back (front-back reversals, FBRs). FBR resolution leads to observations of veridical world-centric sound-source localization perceptions, and FBRs offer a simple outcome observation of these complex mechanisms.Aim 2: Investigate the use of body/head movement information to make head-centric auditory-spatial estimates world-centric. Observe how bodily movement informs world-centric sound-source localization when listeners are allowed to naturally rotate (active self-rotation) or are rotated (passive rotation). Visually induced, perceived listener motion will be investigated and virtual reality procedures will be explored.Aim 3: Investigate how experience, memory, and attention might contribute to the conversion of head-centric auditory-spatial estimates into world-centric auditory-spatial estimates. Our hypothesis is that spatial expectations based on experience can influence judgments of world-centric sound-source location. That is, some sound-source localization perceptions might be based on experiential and memorial and not on only sensory or bodily mechanisms, and, new procedures might be developed to study sound-source localization.",

FP00028339,499,,,,,1,,,"Research Objectives: The broad, long-term goal of this study is to adapt and assess the effects and feasibility of an mHealth sedentary behavior intervention for cancer patients, to in turn rigorously test in a future R01.Aim 1: Adapt an app-based sedentary behavior intervention (i.e., BeWell24) for cancer patients. An advisory board of cancer patients and care providers (N=20) will be asked to use the original BeWell24 app for a week and complete focus groups (N=2) exploring how to adapt BeWell24 for cancer patients. We will work with an app developer and use a user-centered iterative design process to adapt BeWell24. Board members will complete one-on-one sessions to review the adapted app, with a maximum of 3 iterations of feedback and programming expected to ensure the feedback is effectively incorporated and implemented in the final product.Aim 2: Assess feasibility and preliminary effects of the adapted BeWell24 intervention with daily meditation delivered via the Calm app compared to the adapted BeWell24 intervention alone. Cancer patients (N=150) will be randomized to 1) adapted BeWell24 (n=75), or 2) adapted BeWell24 plus Calm (n=75). Device-measured sedentary behavior (primary outcome) and self-reported stress, depression, and anxiety (secondary outcomes) will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (11 weeks) and follow-up (15 weeks). Multivariable regression models (outcomes predicted by group, controlling for baseline and relevant covariates) will assess intervention effects at week 11 and sustained effects at week 15. Feasibility will be assessed via a post-intervention survey (benchmarks: =80% acceptance, demand, and practicality).Health Relatedness: These aims will advance the evidence base for effective, scalable intervention methods for decreasing sedentary behavior in cancer patients, which can have a substantial public health impact.Candidate Career Goals and Development Plan: Dr. Bhuiyans long-term goal is to become an independent scientist and leading cancer researcher with expertise in conducting mHealth behavioral interventions for health promotion in cancer patients/survivors and leveraging industry-based platforms for delivering interventions. To this end, she will receive intensive, mentored training in: 1) developing and adapting mHealth behavioral interventions for cancer patients/survivors, 2) designing, conducting, and analyzing clinical trials with cancer patients/survivors, 3) conducting academic-industry research, and 4) intervening on and measuring sedentary behavior.Environment: Dr. Bhuiyans home institution, Arizona State University, is robustly supported by many institutional functions, administrative systems and physical resources, and is one of the fastest growing research enterprises among all U.S. universities.",
FP00028354,500,,,,,1,,,"Towards Effective Robot-assisted Rehabilitation of Hemiparetic Gait via Trilateral Collaboration among Patients, Therapists, and Soft Robotic Exosuits Overview:  Acquired brain injury is a leading cause of long-term disability and mobility deficits. For instance, gait impairment occurs in more than 80% of stroke survivors, and over 30% of stroke survivors will require long-term care. Rehabilitation plays a critical role for stroke patients to regain ambulatory functions and living independence, but conventional rehabilitation with therapists can be labor-intensive, expensive, and inaccessible. Robotic rehabilitation holds a strong potential to reduce the cost and improve performance, but  existing  robotic  solutions  have  not  satisfied  the  clinical  needs  because  they  lack  safety  to  operate without close monitoring, customizability to fit different patients, adaptability to learn the user preference, and intelligence to collaborate  with therapists.  This project aims to tackle these  challenges by  a  novel integration of wearable soft robotics, machine learning, motor control, and clinical rehabilitation, spanned in three synergistic thrusts: 1) customizable design and precise control of a soft robotic hip-knee exosuit based on inflatable fabric actuators to support flexion and extension motions, 2) user interface design for sensory  feedback  and  online  torque  adjustment  by  the  therapist,  and  3)  robot  learning  for  triadic collaboration between the patient, therapist, and robotic exosuit. The soft robotic exosuit system will be evaluated with 24 hemiparetic patients to assess its feasibility, safety, and effectiveness in the clinic via an integrative  design  between  clinicians,  engineers,  and  movement  scientists.  Key  words:  soft  robotic, human-robot interaction, rehabilitation. Intellectual Merit:  This  interdisciplinary  project  creates  new  knowledge  by  innovative  integration  of  soft  robotics,  robot learning, neuroscience, movement science, and clinical rehabilitation. The transformative contribution of this  project  is  threefold:  1)  computational  and  dynamic  models  of  fabric-based  inflatable  actuators  to accurately predict the output force, motion, and stiffness, which enables customized design and precision control  of  the  soft  robotic  exosuit;  2)  identification  of  effective  gait  metrics  as  real-time  feedback  for therapists to adjust the robot assistance across different patients and tasks; 3) robot learning algorithms that extract compact representations of the mutual dependencies of more than two agents and, in turn, generate  responsive  and  ergonomic  control  signals  during  the  physical  interaction  among  the  patient, therapist, and soft robotic exosuit. A critical novelty of the algorithms developed in this project is the ability to model and generate nimble, delicate and biomechanically-safe physical responses during interaction with multiple  human  partners  each  of  whom  may  have  a  different  role.  This  project  develops  a  systemic framework for wearable soft robots to effectively collaborate with therapists and assist patients with various types and levels of residual motor functions, which will accelerate the use of low-cost soft robotics in clinical gait rehabilitation for improved training performance. Broader Impacts:  Stroke-related costs in the US came close to $46 billion in 2014, and it is estimated that there could be as many  as  70  million  stroke  survivors  worldwide  by  2030.  The  developed  soft  robotic  exosuit  system enables  safe,  precise  and  personalized  rehabilitation  training  of  stroke  survivors  to  regain  functional independence at a lower cost. This device would also allow therapists to safely initiate tasks earlier in the rehab  training  which  can  help  mitigate  potential  compensatory  strategies,  facilitate  neuromuscular  re-education, and reduce overall lengths of inpatient rehab stays. Moreover, the low costs of soft exosuits enable robot-aided gait training at home, which can serve patients from low-income families and rural areas who  do  not  have  regular  access  to  rehabilitation  facilities.  The  developed  soft  robots  and  learning algorithms can be applied to manufacturing, logistics, and space exploration to reduce work-related injuries and improve work performance. The impacts of this project will be broadened by multiple education and outreach activities, including offering internships to students from underrepresented groups to increase the awareness of medical robotics, design of a new cross-disciplinary course on robotic rehabilitation, and dissemination of the project outcomes through summer workshops and public datasets.

FP00028402,501,,,,,1,,," Natural products have been used medicinally for centuries.  Omega-3 fatty acids found in marine oils are one such class.  Another class is plant products such as flavonoids, natural phenolic compounds with beneficial health effects including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties.  Anthocyanins, a subclass of flavonoids, are plant pigments that provide the rich color of many plants, fruits, and flowers.  Health benefits of anthocyanins have been widely reported in the research literature, particularly for disease conditions associated with oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases1. Emerging evidence suggests that anthocyanins may also modulate gut microbiota, which can impact a wide variety of health conditions2.   Maqui berries (Aristotelia chilensis), indigenous to Chile, have one of the highest concentrations of anthocyanins in the plant world; moreover, the dominant anthocyanin in maqui berries is delphinidin.  Delphinidin is more bioavailable than most flavonoids, with intact molecules absorbed in appreciable amounts in less than an hour after consumption3.  Systemic effects of delphinidin include reduced inflammation due to downregulation of NF-kB,4,5, the transcription factor that initiates the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.6,7   The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], a component of omega-3 fatty acid concentrates, also has anti-inflammatory properties.  There is much empirical evidence demonstrating beneficial effects of EPA supplementation, linked mainly to reductions in inflammation.8   The anti-inflammatory properties of EPA include the inhibition of gene expression and the mitigation of the inflammatory cascade initiated by arachidonic acid.9,10  It has been demonstrated the dietary supplementation with EPA-rich marine oil concentrations also reduces cytokine levels.11,12     We believe there may be a synergistic interaction of these two distinct natural products, which will enhance the reduction of cytokine production. Goal:  To determine the effect of maqui extract plus omega-3 fatty acids compared to a placebo in reducing inflammatory cytokine levels in older, obese adults.",

FP00028545,505,,,,,1,,,"Abstract There is broad agreement that first five years of human life have far reaching impact throughout the lifespan, contributing to distal health outcomes, professional success and overall life happiness. Social determinants of health (SDOH, e.g., poverty, discrimination) create documented disparities in the health behavior and outcomes of underserved populations (UP); attending in-person early care and education (ECE) offers a profound buffer to many SDOH. Our previous experience working with community partnerships in the Sustainability via Active Garden Education (SAGE; U01 MD010667-01) project, uniquely position our team to work with Phoenix ECE sites to determine how to get young children from UP back to ECE quickly and efficiently. Routine screenings for children before they go to school could be a possible solution to hasten children back to in class learning, but little is known about COVID-19 testing, safety measures and follow up in preschool-age children (age 3-5) and their families. The tripod of prevention (distancing, face coverings, ventilation) is recommended by the CDC as best practices to get kids back to school safely, but often not feasible in ECE. Ecologic frameworks suggest that getting kids back to in-person ECE is a systemic challengeneeding to be anchored in a neighborhood at a place close to where the people are already going be to achieve maximum participation. Ecologic frameworks also indicate that the social environment has a huge impact on health behaviors and health outcomes. Testing strategies to safely return young children to ECE must be teacher-, family-, and community-focused. Hispanic children and families are medically underserved, culturally unique, the largest ethnic minority group in the US, and are overburdened by the pandemic, experiencing greater suffering from COVID-19 medical and economic issues. Participatory approaches employing community health workers may help to ameliorate these issues by building trust with the community through partnerships that increase understanding of the value of research, help community members play a role in the research, and improve their own health-related decision making. ASU has fantastic, scaled state-wide testing capacity and capability. We propose to work with CACFP-eligible ECE sites, teachers and the families affiliated with these sites (primarily Hispanic) to develop a strategy to implement salivary COVID-19 screening testing for teachers, students, and families. We propose to develop a protocol for testing young children (ages 3-5) using the ASU salivary COVID-19 test. In Aim 1, we will determine the feasibility and acceptability of routine COVID-19 screening and follow-up services for CACFP-eligible ECE school personnel (teachers and staff) who have direct contact with children (April, May, 20201). In Aim 2, we will test the efficacy of an ECE-based salivary PCR screening program for school personnel to determine its effects on monthly enrollment and weekly attendance in summer 2021, based on best practices identified in Aim 1 (June-July 2021). In Aim 3, we will develop a protocol and determine the acceptability and feasibility of testing young children attending ECE sites and their family members (April, May, 2021). In Aim 4, we will determine the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of testing children and families as a pre-screening strategy for entry back to ECE using enhanced outreach. In Aim 5, we will determine the potential for sustainability and scalability of back-to-school programming including routine screening for ECE personnel and students and families having negative COVID-19 test results (Fall 2021-Spring 2022). If successful, this project will contribute to the science by developing and testing a new, low burden protocol for testing young children and determine acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of comprehensive ECE and family screenings impact ECE enrollment and attendance, offering guidance for sustainable scalability to help kids not only get back to in-person learning but also to remain in ECE.

FP00028546,506,,,,,1,,,"Metabolomics, the comprehensive study of small molecular-weight metabolites and their dynamic changes in biological systems, provides a promising approach to study metabolism that is sensitive to multiple myeloma (MM) and its therapy. In particular, mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics has proven to be a promising tool for analyzing metabolic alterations due to various cancers and, therefore, can provide sensitive and valuable diagnostic information, pathogenesis identification, potential therapeutic targets for clinical treatments, and cancer monitoring and prognosis. In fact, we performed metabolomic profiling of B cells isolated from 3 healthy donors and 9 human MM cell lines, and we found that activated B cells and MM cells have dramatically different metabolic profiles. Figure 1 displays two examples of differentially expressed metabolites, i.e., cGMP and PGE2, identified in this pilot experiment. It is also worth noting that in our metabolomics analysis, each MM cell line expressed very high levels of carnitine and acetylcarnitine, two metabolites reported by others to be elevated in the serum of patients with active MM disease.Inspired by these previous promising results, we hypothesize that MM causes unique metabolic patterns, which are detectable by metabolomics and will provide innovative and promising approaches to enable accurate and fast therapeutic development and monitoring. In this project, the overall objective is to identify sensitive and specific metabolite biomarkers of therapeutic response or resistance along with novel treatment regimens that will together produce deeper and durable remissions in MM. Aim 1: Develop and validate metabolite biomarkers capable of predicting responses to immunomodulating drugs in advance. We will collect bone marrow samples and peripheral blood samples from patients enrolled in a clinical trial across the three Mayo Clinic campuses: Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida; and Rochester, Minnesota. MM patients will include those with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, or newly diagnosed disease requiring treatment, as well as those progressing on maintenance therapy with immunomodulating drugs. In Aim 1a, we will examine the metabolite alterations in thioredoxin and oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways, mainly including glycolysis and TCA metabolites, amino acids, fatty acids, carnitines, etc. In Aim 1b, we will use state-of-the-art metabolomics methods and platforms to investigate metabolic changes in a broad range of thousands of aqueous metabolites and lipids. Using advanced statistical approaches, we will first identify metabolic biomarker candidates from the Discovery Set samples. Then, the biomarker candidates from the Discovery Set will be ported to targeted metabolomics and validated for their clinical performance using an independent sample set (Validation Set). Aim 2: Determine metabolic mechanisms for novel molecules to augment the therapeutic effect of existing therapies in multiple myeloma. We will complete in vitro drug screening of novel molecules and validate these candidate molecules in in vivo models as well as test them in combination with existing myeloma therapies to determine their synergistic potential. Aim 2a: we will test whether the novel molecule inhibitors can disrupt the metabolite levels in the thioredoxin and oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways. Aim 2b: we will test whether the metabolic flux in the thioredoxin and oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways is altered. We will perform metabolic flux analysis (MFA), and stable isotope tracers, such as [U-13C]-glucose, [U-13C]-glutamine, and [U-15N]-glutamine, will be used to track the carbon and nitrogen distributions in different cell lines and animal models. In contrast to instantaneous metabolic level readouts, the advantage of tracking stable isotope labeled tracers is that it enables a dynamic model of cellular phenotype, through tracing metabolite conversions taking place in the metabolic network composed of biochemical pathways.Successful completion of this project will yield validated metabolite biomarkers for immunomodulating drug response in patients with multiple myeloma. The outcome of our studies will also open a new and unique window to accelerate the cancer drug development process, through identifying metabolic vulnerabilities in the thioredoxin and oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways. In addition, the proposed study will set the stage for first-in-human clinical trials using our novel molecule inhibitors in multiple myeloma in order to bring these novel therapies from bench to bedside.",

There has been growing appreciation of the importance of the gut-liver-brain axis to AD, and dysfunctions in the liver and gut have been shown to interact with AD pathogenesis. Further, bioenergetic shifts involving fatty acid metabolism play a significant role in AD. The brain uses glucose as its primary fuel for energy production; however, reduced glucose transport and metabolism in the brain is an early and constant feature of AD. Under this energetic crisis, ketone bodies derived from fatty acids in the liver can be imported into the brain and used as the primary alternate fuel source. Consequently, development of AD may be influenced by whole-body fatty acid metabolism, rather than being an isolated condition of the brain. This proposal is inspired by our recent findings that decreased levels of a subset of fatty acids found in the brain, lauric acid in particular, correlate with AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. In addition, previous studies have shown the neuroprotective potential of coconut oil, in which lauric acid makes up ~50% of the fatty acids, on cognition and AD-related pathogenesis. However, mechanisms governing AD pathogenesis and its relationship to whole-body fatty acid metabolism are ill-defined. To at least partially address these fundamental gaps, we hypothesize that whole-body metabolic reprogramming, including fatty acid metabolism, is profoundly involved in AD development and progression. The overall objective of this study (short-term goal) is to further collect validation and mechanistic data in human subjects, and to establish whether 3xTg mice reproduce abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism along the gut-liver-brain axis, making them useful for exploration of mechanisms and testing of potential treatments. In Aim 1, we will validate dysregulated fatty acid metabolism in AD using a multi-omics approach on another independent sample set. Our working hypothesis is that decreased fatty acids levels in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD subjects will be accompanied by down-regulated fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and/or up-regulated fatty acid -oxidation (FAO), locally in the human brain. In Aim 2, we will determine AD-associated whole-body fatty acid metabolism and whether targeting it can intervene in AD using a mouse model (Exploratory). Our working hypothesis is that dysregulated fatty acid metabolism will exist along the gut-liver-brain axis, and that targeting those alterations through lauric acid supplementation can delay and/or alleviate AD pathogenesis. The expected outcomes include validation of our previous work in human tissues and the gain of additional insights into the mechanisms underlying whole-body fatty acid dysregulation in AD. Importantly, we will provide pre-clinical evidence establishing whether fatty acid supplementation can affect AD-associated outcomes.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic lung diseases, are a global epidemic (WHO, 2020).  Of 56.9 million global deaths in 2016, 40.5 million, or 71%, were due to NCDs and over three quarters occurred in low- and middle-income countries (WHO, 2020). NCDs are primarily caused by four behavioral health risks: physical inactivity; poor nutrition; tobacco use; and excessive alcohol use (Milani et al., 2016). In developing countries rapid globalization has led to a change from low calorie, high fiber foods to processed foods high in fat, salt, and sugar (Steyn & McHiza, 2014). Technological development has led to decreased physical labor and active transport, which in turn contribute to decreasing levels of physical activity in developing countries (Goryakin et al., 2015). Alcohol use and heavy episodic binge drinking is rising across much of the Asia region, with significant increases in China, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Vietnam (Manthey et al., 2019). A tobacco smoking epidemic has developed rapidly in Asia for men, with mortality associated with tobacco use rising and the proportion of men smoking, starting at an earlier age, and smoking more heavily (Yang et al., 2019). Research demonstrates that increased physical activity and improved nutrition can prevent about 1.3 million chronic disease related deaths and about 18 million deaths caused by obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, respectively (WHO, 2014). Smoking cessation can result in a 90% reduction in the excess risk of death for those who stop smoking by age 40, and for those who stop smoking by age 30 the mortality risk is similar to non-smokers (Jha et al., 2014). Notably, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, depression and lack of physical activity are all modifiable risk factors for dementia (Livingston et al. 2020). Improving global health and well-being requires a focus on reducing the risk of NCDs which may increase risk of neurocognitive disease and mortality in late life. Problem Statement. The first line treatment for NCDs in Asia for diabetes is pharmacotherapy only, delivered in brief visits often of a few minutes duration. Behavioral interventions to address lifestyle, stress, psychological or substance use disorders are not available due to lack of clinician time, skills and resources. (Tham et al., 2017). Emerging evidence demonstrated that smartphone-delivered education and patient healtlh self-management skills are effective in improving lifestyle problems, comorbid behavioral conditions, and in better management of NCDs (Kitsiou et al., 2017). The goal of this proposal is to pilot a mHealth smartphone that includes a patient self-reported HRA and education and health self-management activities tailored to the lifestyle problems and behavior conditions of each patient. Aim 1: To evaluate the usability of the Happy Heart app by diabetes patients in China based on patient use of the app functions (completing HRA, engaging in health self-management activities). In addition, measures of app use, ease of use, user satisfaction, desirability of app features, and how the app can be improved will be evaluated. Aim 2: To assess the effectiveness of the Happy Heart app in improving patient knowledge of health risks, readiness to change health behaviors, and behavioral change strategies and techniques designed to improve lifestyle behaviors and coping with stress and behavioral symptoms. Measures include pre- and post-app use measures of knowledge of health behaviors, recommendations for change, improvements in problems on the HRA, and improved readiness to change.Aim 3: Exploratory analyses. We will evaluate the impact of app use on biometric measures recorded from the patient medical record pre- and post-app use. Measures include HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and waist circumference. We will also evaluate demographic and social determinant of health measures that are collected on the app and their relationship to Happy Heart app usability measures. IMPACT The use of the Happy Heart app by patients will improve the identification of health risks, patient education, engagement and health self-management activities to improve health behaviors of patients diagnosed with diabetes. The China Guangzhou CDC will use the results to lobby local government to fund program beyond this pilot We will build on the size and scope of this pilot study by applying for larger grants (Table 1). We plan to conduct a clinical trial and include workforce training to actively support Happy Heart app for diabetes and other NCDs, for addressing the physical and mental health adjustments to patients who experience trauma and HIV. The Happy Heart app platform will address the need to build capacity in globally to deliver a population health approach to promote patient health self-management. In addition, this project is planned for 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic will still be a barrier to treatment and the Happy Heart app will provide safer care delivery via remote access.",
FP00028632,511,,,,,1,,,"There is increasing recognition among business leaders that wellness, broadly interpreted, can make all the difference when creating a healthy company culture and environment. The historic pandemic of 2020 has impacted the definition of workplace at its most fundamental level. The shift to remote work -- often characterized by sedentary work, lack of physical embodied experiences, and accompanied by a loss of sense of community -- has brought into sharp relief the importance of physical and mental health practices while being at work. Work in the future is expected to occur in a combination of home-based, commuter-based, and traditional office spaces. Wellness is closely linked to experience -- including the experience of a genuine connection to ones own body (embodied), connection to other humans (community), and a connection to nature (biophilia). With emerging technological tools, in interactive immersive media, augmented reality, computer vision, machine learning, and more, we aim to create the next generation of workplace wellness practices and experiences that promote embodiment, interaction, and a sense of immersion in biophilic spaces. These tools will be deployed to room-scale wellness pods, home-based augmented pods, and mobile-based commuter experiences. Our team has a long successful track-record of radical interdisciplinary collaboration, across disciplines including signal processing, machine learning, health, design, music, movement studies, and more, which will ensure our approach for generating integrative research has a solid foundation, with high chance of future success.",
FP00028642,512,,,,,1,,,"The rapid transition to improved economic, environmental and social change in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) has resulted in epidemiological transitions that include increases in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including T2DM (Yoon et. al. 2006). The age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes in Thailand increased from 7.7% in 2004 to 9.9% in 2014 (8.9% in men and 10.8% in women) (Aekplakorn et. al. 2018). ). Thailand also faced dramatically increased of NCD leading to higher mortality accounted for 28.10% in male, and 18.80 % in female in the age of 30-69 years old (Srivanichakorn, 2017). T2DM is the top cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) for Thai women and the seventh cause for men (Bundhacharoe et. al. 2011) and is an economic burden with annual cost per patient 21% of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) (Chatterjee et. al. 2011). Causes of the increased prevalence of T2DM in Thailand include age and BMI and for men alcohol intake and smoking (Papier et. al. 2016). A meta-analysis of adherence to diabetes medications found a range of 38.5 to 93.1% adherence, but only 22.2% reported adherence of > 80% (Krass et. al. 2014). Only 42.2% of the Thai adults have been able to regularly meet the physical activity guidelines set forth by WHO (Liangruenrom et al., 2017). Consequently, Thailand has one of the highest incidences of overweight in Southeast Asia (Ng et al., 2014). In 2005 overweight and obesity rates were 35% for men and nearly 45% for women (Jitnarin et al., 2010).Glycemic ControlGlycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level is an indicator of glycemic control with high levels (7%) associated with higher risk of developing complications and mortality (IHME, 2017), Maintaining HbA1c in control (<7%) is a protective factor against T2DM complications such as diabetes retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy (Vasudevan et al., 2006). Successful glycemic control is achieved by effective diabetes self-care or self-management by the patient, such as good adherence to prescribed medication, routine monitoring of diet and blood glucose levels, increased physical activity, reduced obesity and foot care (Hurst et al., 2020). Improved diabetes self-management resulted in improved health outcomes and reduced incidence of complications (Al-Khawalden et al., 2012; Houle et al, 2015) and may be almost as efficacious as antihypertensive medications in controlling blood glucose, especially in early stages of T2DM (McDowell et al., 2005). In spite of the importance of diabetes self-management, many patients lack these self-care skills (Fitzpatrick et al., 2013). Depression and in T2DM patientsDepression and stress is common in T2DM patients. The INTERPRET-DD study in 14 countries found T2DM prevalence of 10.6% major depression and 17% moderate to severe depression (Lloyd et al, 2018). Thai adults diagnosed with T2DM and hypertension have increased risk for mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety (AlKhathami et al., 2017). A systematic review by Sumlin et al. (2014) concluded that depression in T2DM patients was associated with lower adherence to diabetes self-management. T2DM patients with depression were less likely to adhere to recommended diet and physical activity recommendations, resulting in poor glycemic control and greater diabetes complications than T2DM without depression (DeGroot et al., 2001). The comorbidity of depression and T2DM in Thailand is between 14% and 28% (Thaneerat et al., 2009). Biggers et al. (2018) found that depressive symptoms were associated with hypoglycemia in Thai patients.",
FP00028642_Res1,513,,,,,1,,,"PROBLEM: Type 2 diabetes myelitis (T2DM) is increasing globally with estimated 415 million people currently rising to 642 million by 2040, resulting in 1.6 million deaths annually, the majority living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)1. T2DM is a major cause of blindness, nerve damage, heart attack, kidney failure, stroke and lower limb amputations1. T2DM is largely caused by poor lifestyle habits such as decreased physical activity, poor diet, obesity, and for men alcohol intake and smoking.2 The problem is exacerbated in LMICs due to economic transition leading to increased intake of unhealthy food and decreased physical activity that result in obesity; a lack of patient education about the importance of treatment, poor access to care related to low income and living in rural areas with limited access to clinics1. The prevalence of diabetes in Thailand increased from 7.7% in 2004 to 9.9% in 2014 (8.9% in men and 10.8% in women)1 and annual cost per patient is 21% of per capita gross domestic product.3 Total annual costs represent 23% direct medical costs (medicine, hospital care), 40% direct non-medical costs (informal care provided by family caregivers) and 37% indirect costs (disability, loss of work productivity) and costs increase with age, duration of illness and comorbidities3.TREATMENT & BARRIERS: Maintaining glycated hemoglobin {HbA1c) in control (<7%) is a protective factor against T2DM complications and is achieved by teaching patients diabetes self-management and behaviors such as good adherence to prescribed medication and dietary guidelines, routine monitoring of HbA1c, increased physical activity and reduced obesity1. In Thailand underdiagnosis and poor treatment response is common  of 4.8 million people living with T2DM and prediabetes, only 57% (2.7 million) are diagnosed, and while most who are diagnosed receive treatment (97%) only 35.6% (.9 million) respond to treatment targets, meaning that only 18% of all T2DM/prediabetes cases in Thailand are treated effectively4. Underdiagnosis is a cost issue, delaying the start of treatment and leading to greater complications and cost - the cost of patients with complications is 4 times greater than for patients without complications3. Reasons for lack of undertreatment include lack of patient awareness; barriers such as low socioeconomic status and living in rural area that makes travel to clinics difficult, and a lack of clinicians trained to deliver diabetes self-management education (DSME)4. T2DM is also a risk factor for worse outcomes for COVID19 such as severe respiratory involvement, ICU admissions, need for ventilation and mortality, and cOVID19 infection is associated with development of new-onset diabetes and worsening control in pre-diabetes5. Also, public health measures such as lockdown adversely impact T2DM patients by limiting access to in-person clinical care, healthy diet and opportunities for exercise5.SOLUTION: The AIM of this proposal is to demonstrate that a DSME smartphone app program, Care4Diabetes (C4D), combined with workforce training in DSME, delivered both in-person and via app telehealth is the solution to achieving HbA1c control and reversing the human and economic toll of T2DM. C4D will be more cost-effective that current treatment because improved DSME by patients will result in better HbA1c control, improved nutrition, physical activity and reduced obesity and  improved depression management, resulting in decreased complications, reduced disability, and decreased cost associated with complications. The telehealth app feature will enable patient-clinician communication even in poor, rural areas, eliminating that barrier to treatment. Patients and families will benefit by improved functioning at home and work, and less suffering. The healthcare system will benefit by improved workforce DMSE competency and reduced cost of care as T2DM  complications decrease.",

FP00028653,515,,,,,1,,,"BackgroundReading comprehension is arguably the most important skill for children to develop as they progress through their formal education. However, many adolescent bilingual students with LD struggle with reading comprehension in the middle grades as they encounter different text structures and the demand for more complex oral language skills, vocabulary, and background knowledge increases. Moreover, adolescent bilingual learners with LD often lag behind in the development of these complex skills in their second language. Because many adolescent bilingual learners with LD have poor reading comprehension, they are at risk for academic failure and at risk for dropping out of school.Although there is consensus on the need for research to establish the efficacy of reading comprehension interventions for bilingual students with LD, there are few studies with these students. This study addresses that need by testing a reading comprehension intervention for Spanish-English bilingual students with LD who are in middle school level.Research Questions1.Does the graphic organizer group score significantly higher than the control group on the Woodcock Johnson III Passage Comprehension, Qualitative Reading Inventory, or the researcher created measures of reading comprehension? 2.Does oral reading fluency predict gains in reading comprehension from pretest to posttest on the Woodcock Johnson III Tests of Achievement Passage Comprehension, Qualitative Reading Inventory-6 or the proximal measures of reading comprehension?3.Do participants perceive the usefulness of the funnel map in helping with reading comprehension?MethodUsing a randomized control trial with treatment and control conditions, we will test the efficacy of a graphic organizer on the reading comprehension of 156 Spanish-English bilingual learners with reading disabilities . Participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition. Participants in the treatment condition will be randomly assigned to groups of four. Participants will engage in six one-hour treatment sessions delivered via Zoom.AnalysesWe will compare the reading comprehension of the treatment and control groups using a one-way ANCOVA. To determine if oral reading fluency predicted reading comprehension gains, we will run a simple linear regression on the reading comprehension measures.Innovation and ImpactThe intervention proposed in this study is innovative in four ways. First, this intervention will be delivered in small groups to mirror the types of Tier 2 interventions that are commonly seen in public schools. Second, the intervention lesson plans are scripted, making it easy for trained teaching assistants to deliver with fidelity. Third, because the intervention can be delivered by teaching assistants, the potential costs to districts is low. Finally, this intervention targets comprehension of expository texts which are commonly read in middle and high school grades. The need for an efficacious intervention for these bilingual learners with learning disabilities cannot be overstated as evidenced by NAEP reading results.",

If so, mark as NA.    When you write a protocol, keep an electronic copy. You will need a copy if it is necessary to make changes.   1  Protocol Title Include the full protocol title: A Pilot Study of Calm for Cancer Patient Sleep Disturbance 2  Background and Objectives Provide the scientific or scholarly background for, rationale for, and significance of the research based on the existing literature and how will it add to existing knowledge.   Describe the purpose of the study.   Describe any relevant preliminary data or case studies.   Describe any past studies that are in conjunction to this study. Cancer patients, both hematological and solid tumor,  struggle with chronic symptom burden, including  fatigue, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, to name a few, and due to a lack of curative therapies, symptom burden can be lifelong in some patients. Sleep disturbance is one of the most common complaints among cancer patients (reported in as many as 85% of cancer patients and survivors) depending on the type of cancer), but is often not fully addressed by pharmacologic intervention alone. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has received increasing attention as an efficacious complementary therapy for improving sleep-related outcomes amongst cancer patients, but is a time consuming and laborious intervention often requiring in-person specialty care. Smartphones offer a novel medium through which to deliver complementary interventions, and we have successfully delivered meditation to hematological cancer patients previously via the Calm app with moderate effects demonstrated on sleep disturbance. However, more research is needed to test the preliminary effects of smartphone-based meditation among cancer patients for sleep disturbance as compared to an active control group. Furthermore, preliminary research has suggested the use of meditation as a method for promoting physical activity and counteracting sedentary behaviors. However, there has been minimal research exploring this in cancer patients, a population in which engaging in physical activity and decreasing sedentary behaviors are critical for reducing adverse cancer-related symptoms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to pilot test an 8-week smartphone-based meditation intervention (i.e., Calm) on cancer patient sleep disturbance (primary outcome) as compared to a health education podcast control group delivered via smartphone app.   Specific Aim #1: Explore the preliminary effects (i.e., is there a clear meaningful effect, not powered for efficacy) of eight weeks of daily Calm app use on sleep disturbance in cancer patients as compared to a podcast control group. Hypothesis: Those in the Calm app groups will experience  improvements in sleep disturbance greater than those experienced by the podcast control group at eight weeks.  Specific Aim #2: Explore the preliminary effects (i.e., is there a clear meaningful effect, not powered for efficacy) of eight weeks of daily Calm app use on cancer patient pain intensity, anxiety, depression, global health, quality of life, emotional regulation, and mindfulness as compared to a podcast control group.  Hypothesis: Those in the Calm app groups will experience improvements in pain intensity, anxiety, depression, global health, quality of life, emotional regulation, and mindfulness greater than those experienced by the podcast control group at eight weeks.  Specific Aim #3: Explore the preliminary effects (i.e., is there a clear meaningful effect, not powered for efficacy) of eight weeks of daily Calm app use on cancer patient physical activity and sedentary behaviors as compared to a podcast control group.  Hypothesis: Those in the Calm app groups will experience increases in physical activity and decreases in sedentary behaviors greater than those experienced by the podcast control group at eight weeks.  Exploratory Aim: Explore the sustained effects of Calm app use on cancer patients (i.e., 4-week follow-up). Hypothesis: Those in the Calm app groups will experience improvements across outcomes compared to baseline that are sustained at 12 weeks.  3  Data Use Describe how the data will be used.

Describe procedures including:   The duration of time participants will spend in each research activity.    The period or span of time for the collection of data, and any long term follow up.   Surveys or questionnaires that will be administered (Attach all surveys, interview questions, scripts, data collection forms, and instructions for participants to the online application). Interventions and sessions (Attach supplemental materials to the online application).     Lab procedures and tests and related instructions to participants.    Video or audio recordings of participants.   Previously collected data sets that that will be analyzed and identify the data source (Attach data use agreement(s) to the online application). Interested patients will complete an eligibility screening using a REDCap link (see eligibility survey). The eligibility screening takes 5-10 minutes to complete.  If ineligible, the participant will be sent an email notification (see study protocol) regarding their ineligibility. If eligible, the potential participant will be emailed a link to watch a video-based study overview (i.e., intake video;  https://youtu.be/aAHlB59xkH4). The intake video will provide greater details pertaining to the study, review of the consent process, and allow the potential participant to leave questions for research personnel to answer (See study protocol). Following the intake video and before signing the consent, the potential participant will be asked a few questions to assess their understanding/competency of the study procedures. The potential participant must get 100% of the questions correct in order to proceed and sign the electronic informed consent.  After successfully completing the intake video and quiz, the participant will be directed to an informed consent page via REDCap with details concerning the requirements of the study, as well as potential risks and benefits. There will be a place for the participant to type in their electronic signature, which will constitute their consent to participate in the study (see informed consent). After receipt of the signed consent form, the participant will be directed to a REDCap link to complete baseline self-report measures (listed below). At this point, the participant will be randomized into one of three groups in a 2:2:1 design: 1) a Calm app group instructed to use the meditations before bed (intervention group #1; n=120), 2) a Calm app group instructed to use the sleep stories ONLY before bed (intervention group #2; n=120), or 3) an active health education podcast group (control group; n=60). Depending on which group the participant has been randomized to, they will receive an email with the following contents:  Calm app intervention group #1 email: welcome letter, important dates calendar, Calm app instructions #1, and sleep diary  Calm app intervention group #2 email: welcome letter, important dates calendar, Calm app instructions #2, and sleep diary  Health education control group email: welcome letter with podcast app instructions, important dates calendar, and sleep diary  Once these emails are sent to and viewed by the participant, they will be given access to the intervention.   Calm App Intervention Group #1: The intervention will be 8-weeks in duration. Patients will be asked to use the Calm app for at least 10 min/day (i.e., ~70 min/week). Participants will be instructed to listen to a meditation each day lasting at least 10 minutes right before they go to bed.   Calm App Intervention Group #2: The intervention will be 8-weeks in duration. Patients will be asked to use the Calm app for at least 10 min/day (i.e., ~70 min/week). Participants will be instructed to listen to a sleep story each day lasting at least 10 minutes right before they go to bed.   Health Education Podcast App Control Group: The control group will serve as an active control group and will be matched for time and attention to the intervention group. Participants assigned to the control group will be asked to listen to/view 10-min/day (i.e., ~70 min/week) of health education podcasts via a smartphone app. Topics covered in the health education control vary and will be aimed at providing useful and informative health-related information pertinent to cancer patients. The podcast app was developed by an independent app developer, and it was designed to mirror the type of functionality that the Calm app offers its users.   SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL INSTRUCTIONS AND TEMPLATE  NUMBER HRP-503a DATE 10/24/2022 PAGE 4 of 6  Participants will access the Calm mobile application or the health education podcast mobile application using their provided username and password (See instruction document). Participants will be asked to participate in a total of at least 70 minutes of meditation or podcast viewing/listening. We will ask that participants follow their provided instructions.  Outcome Measures: We will use self-report questionnaires at baseline (week 0), mid-point (week 4), post-intervention (week 8), and follow-up (week 12) administered via REDCap (see baseline, mid-point, post-intervention, and follow-up questionnaires) to measure study outcomes. This will include demographics and health information (baseline only), as well as sleep disturbance, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, and global health via the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Information System (PROMIS), quality of life via the General Version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer (FACT-G) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC30), emotional regulation via the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, mindfulness via the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), physical activity via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and sedentary behavior via the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ). App feedback/satisfaction questionnaires will also be administered at post-intervention in order to gather feedback about the Calm app and the podcast app. Finally, all study participants will be asked to complete an online sleep diary daily (through week 8 and for an additional week during week 12) in which they will be asked to record sleep and wake times as well as sleep quality.  Regardless of group assignment, all study participants will complete the aforementioned outcome assessments. Participation will be measured during the entire intervention using internal tracking systems within each app (i.e., # of times logged in, classes/podcast accessed from prescription, classes/podcast accessed outside of prescription, time spent in class/podcast, completion of class/podcast, date and time of class/podcast access). This data will be provided to us through data coordinators of these applications.  8  Compensation or Credit   Describe the amount and timing of any compensation or credit to participants.    Identify the source of the funds to compensate participants   Justify that the amount given to participants is reasonable.  If participants are receiving course credit for participating in research, alternative assignments need to be put in place to avoid coercion.   Participants will be given a monetary incentive ($40) at the end of the intervention upon successful completion of ALL study questionnaires (i.e., baseline, mid-point, post-intervention, and follow-up questionnaires).  A total incentive of $40 and free access to either a meditation app or a podcast app is an appropriate compensation for study participants completing four total questionnaires that take between 15-20 minutes each and for participating in 70 min/week of health activities. Incentives will be mailed to all study participants with the mailing address that is provided in the baseline questionnaire. Responses to the questionnaires will be kept confidential. Only research study personnel will have access to names and personal identifying information that is associated with questionnaires.  9  Risk to Participants List the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or inconveniences related to participation in the research. Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks. There are no more than minimal risks to participation in this study. Meditation may cause study participants suffering from psychological illness (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.) to experience a temporary increase in their symptoms as the practice of meditation teaches participants to become more mindful of their thoughts, feelings, and emotions.   10  Potential Benefits to Participants Realistically describe the potential benefits that individual participants may experience from taking part in the research. Indicate if there is no direct benefit. Do not include benefits to society or others.

Overdose prevention education using a harm reduction approach has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing deaths. Additionally, peer support provided by individuals with lived criminal justice and substance use/misuse is a successful intervention method for criminal justice-involved persons with substance use disorders. The purpose of this study is to evaluate tertiary prevention efforts using a comprehensive peer support program for incarcerated individuals who use illicit stimulants in the Maricopa County, Arizona jail system. The study uses a quasi-experimental effectiveness-implementation hybrid (Type 2) design with a matched comparison group. The peer support program consists of illicit stimulant use screening, risk assessment and stratification, overdose prevention education, and care coordination by a peer navigator. This program targets individuals incarcerated for a short period of time (more than 24 hours and less than 72 hours), who represent a rapidly cycling jail population and are at high-risk for relapse, overdose, and recidivism.",
FP00028670,518,,,,,1,,,"Deciphering the complex relationship between nutrition and health requires the joint study of a broad range of data modalities that independently or synergistically affect food metabolism. In the context of precision nutrition, these modalities are particularly diverse and heterogeneous. They include genomics, metabolomics, and microbiome/metagenomics data that affect our biological response to food. Other factors, often captured with mobile and wearable technologies, include lifestyle behaviors and environmental exposures that impact food intake and calorie expenditure.To fully take advantage of these rich but heterogeneous datasets, novel approaches must be implemented to enable their integrated analysis. Advances in Artificial Intelligence technology provide a great opportunity to address these challenges and new ways to integrate disparate data into AI-ready datasets. These AI-ready datasets will serve as a base for the development of predictive models that, when successfully built, have the potential to highlight unexpected or previously unknown relationships between features. The discovered relationships will in turn lead to new hypothesis generation through active learning for precision nutrition.The mission of the proposed Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Innovation (AIBI) Center is to develop service lines that address the analytical needs of the Nutrition for Precision Health Consortium. The first service line integrates heterogeneous datasets into AI-ready datasets. The second service line leverages these AI-ready datasets for the development of models that predict health outcomes. These two service lines rely on a cutting-edge predictive analytics platform developed and maintained by an expert panel of Bioinformatics and AI scientists under the guidance of Nutrition experts. The platform includes components for data quality control, data harmonization, data augmentation through annotation, data fusion, and data visualization, in addition to interfaces to the Google AI platform for predictive model building. The platform will be maintained as state of the art with the incorporation of new or better performing algorithms. It will also benefit from the methodology developed by four Research Projects that will expand its capability through scientifically validated tools that address the hardest Precision Nutrition problems. The pilot projects will contribute to its improvement by providing real-life use cases that test its functionalities and trigger new developments that will enhance the platforms ability to address ongoing nutrition-related questions. This system also benefits from workflows that allow for continuous learning processes. In particular, our multiple nutrition-dense data sets that will be used in the early years to test the system and to offer early lessons that will be translated back into the Consortium to improve ongoing data collection efforts. The AIBI Center has a unique combination of research and application development expertise with leaders in novel nutrition interventions and data collection, which will ensure the proposed solutions are both scientifically valid and practical for a broad population of users.",

FP00028749_Res1,522,,,,,1,,,"There is abundant evidence that obesity confers increased risk for various forms of cancer. Theincidence of breast, colon, and liver cancer are all increased in obese populations, and the epidemiologicevidence for the obesity-breast cancer connection is particularly strong. One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. Breast cancer incidence increases 10-fold for women age 60 and above, compared to women 50 or younger. The increased breast cancer risk seems to be related to postmenopausal hormone levels, as the increased risk is only seen in women not on hormone replacement therapy. Furthermore the Metabolic Syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia and elevated risk of diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, stroke and Alzheimers disease, is associated with a higher incidence of more aggressive triple negative breast tumors. The increased risk is accelerated by the decline in ovarian estrogen levels after menopause, as pre-menopausal women are protected from the deleterious metabolic effects of obesity, including chronic tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Studies in rodents have confirmed this relationship, showing that dietary-induced obesity and high-fat diets lead to increased incidence and growth of tumors in oncogene and carcinogen-induced breast cancers. Despite this body of correlative evidence, the mechanisms of obesity-induced breast cancer risk remain poorly understood. One possibility is that the insulin resistance causes insulin levels to increase and insulin may drive tumor growth. Indeed, we have found that reducing insulin resistance by treating with omega-3 fatty acids reduces breast cancer growth in mice. We have also found that a time-restricted, high-fat diet improves insulin resistance despite continuing obesity, and also inhibits tumor growth. A number of important questions remain to be answered. Firstly, how does insulin drive tumor growth? Is it a direct effect on the tumor cell, or on the microenvironment? Secondly, does correction of the circadian rhythms in the tumor cell by TRF contribute to the reduced tumor growth? Thirdly, how do nutrients and insulin entrain the circadian clock in the tumors? Due to the link between obesity, insulin resistance and breast cancer in post-menopausal women, and the translational potential of time-restricted feeding, we will investigate the effect of deleting the insulin receptor or the circadian clock in the tumor cell to test whether loss of these signals alters tumor growth and the response to TRF. We will also test whether TRF synergizes with chemotherapy to inhibit tumor growth.",
FP00028769,523,,,,,1,,,"Project title:A convergent device platform for the rapid detection of novel, solid synthetic opioids and additives with minimal or no contactThe overall goal of this project is to develop a convergent device platform for the rapid, accurate, and reliable detection of novel synthetic opioids and additives agents in solid form with minimal or no contact. This tool will merge three multi-disciplinary, marketable products: (#1) a large Raman-based molecular fingerprinting library of over N = 1,000 spectra of individual chemicals and their mixtures for both lab bench and portable Raman systems designed for field applications, (#2) a Web-based application (APP) for end users that will utilize the Raman library and a supervised machine learning model in order to return within minutes either the probability that the analyte mixture contains the target substance (discrimination) or to estimate the concentration of the target substance (regression) from input spectra, and (#3) tiny, inexpensive vials containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of controlled physicochemical properties for the enclosed, crime lab detection of trace amounts of target substances. The platform will be validated in accredited forensic lab settings at the Montgomery County Coroners Office Crime Laboratory (MCCOCL), Ohio, following national guidelines and by comparison with established lab detection methods.This proposal was inspired by our previous U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded research, which led to the development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based method for the multiplex detection of over 35 illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) analogues and metabolites in biological fluids at sub ng mL-1. This forensic tool was successfully implemented at MCCOCL in the post-mortem analysis of over 6,000 human biological samples. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated a 47% increase in synthetic opioid-related deaths from 19,413 in 2016 to 28,466 deaths in 2017. This opioid crisis is further exacerbated by waves of new IMFs, which are created at a fast pace in clandestine labs and are smuggled into the U.S. across the Mexican and Canadian borders or through international mail and shipping services from China. With the emergence of novel IMF analogues that are inadvertently abused in conjunction with other exacerbating drugs (e.g., fentanyl may be mixed with methamphetamine or vice-versa) and/or hazardous additives (e.g., rat poison, deworming agents, and laundry detergents), federal and regulatory agencies (e.g., U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Postal Services) have emphasized the critical need for rapid onsite and forensic lab detection methods, which can overcome the limitations of the current detection methods (e.g., false positives, no purity or concentration, and no concurrent multiplex detection). The identities of many of these drugs such as carfentanil, which can be resistant to Narcan (the anti-opioid overdose reversal drug), were suspected during law enforcement busts and were confirmed through rigorous, complex chemical lab analyses sometime after the incident. The preliminary results of this proposal offer the first demonstration of the multiplex, accurate detection of target drugs in mock street samples with excellent quality metrics (within minutes for point Raman spectra) and with the option of molecularly imaging larger, representative areas on the sample for undeniable reproducibility (within 1-4 hours for Raman maps of hundreds of point spectra).This proposal will catalyze the formation of a multidisciplinary, multiorganizational team of science, forensic, public health, and engineering investigators at Wright State University, MCCOCL, and Arizona State University. New internships and employment opportunities at MCCOCL and other potential industrial partners will emerge for the student participants including underrepresented groups, who will receive training in the mentioned areas of national interest. The emerging technological innovations will find worldwide applications in forensic science labs, law enforcement agencies, first responder teams, and emergency rooms to fight the deadly scourge of drug trafficking and the related crimes.Product #1: A large Raman library of over N = 1,000 spectra of individual chemicals and their mixtures will be created using certified reference standards of illicit drugs, licit drugs, and other chemicals used as cutting agents. The library components will be measured individually, without sample preparation, and then in mixtures simulating those encountered by law enforcement and street drug users at the point of consumption. Authentic drug samples at MCCOCL of different potency and purity will be analyzed blindly and then compared to the results generated following accepted practice for validation purposes and potential correlations to different distribution networks of novel synthetic opioids.Product #2: A Web service will be created using the Raman library as training data with both positive and negative controls for the supervised machine learning model, which will be constructed using both traditional chemometrics and modern methods such as deep neural networks. Evaluation of the model will occur either locally or remotely. In the local case, a user will download a file, which can be used by the software on their device and will perform the calculations necessary to evaluate the model. In the remote case, the users device will send a request using a RESTful API containing the spectra to be analyzed, then the Web software will evaluate the model and send the results back to the users device.Product #3: A tiny vial containing highly concentrated but lowly aggregated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of high purity will be engineered from inexpensive colloids by tangential flow filtration. Target drugs will be complexed by simple mixing into AgNP-target-AgNPs sandwiched nanostructures that will tremendously boost the metrics of trace amounts of opioids or problematic analogues of similar structures through the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) effect.",

FP00028783,525,,,,,1,,,"Topic No. DHA19C-001 1.  PHASE II TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES The overall objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a noise-attenuating earplug that does not introduce or amplify undesirable occlusion effects associated with body-generated sounds. The earplug must be comfortable for long periods, easy to insert and remove, and allow for the integration of level-dependent filters and speakers for communications.   Our approach is based on Paxauriss innovative inflatable earplug concept, which addresses the fit and comfort  issues  of  current  earplugs.  The  result  is  an  easy-to-fit,  comfortable,  deep-insert  earplug  that produces  an  effective  custom  seal  every  time.  This  deep-insert  seal  minimized  the  occlusion  effect. Furthermore, the composition of the earplug fluid may be selected to detune the low-frequency resonance of the ear canal, further reducing the occlusion effect.  In Phase I we proved the feasibility of our approach by preparing a preliminary design of the earplug and fabricating a limited number of units using a representative production manufacturing technique. We then demonstrated the performance of the earplug by measuring its attenuation on acoustic test fixtures while also demonstrating fit, usability, and durability. In Phase II we will further mature the design though an iterative development cycle before conducting human subject tests on production earplugs.  In a Phase II enhancement, we plan to conduct a field trial of the earplugs. In Phase III we will commercialize the earplugs for military and civilian markets. 2.  PHASE II WORK PLAN 2.1.  OVERVIEW AND SCHEDULE To achieve our Phase II objectives, we have organized our Phase I work plan into eight tasks to be completed  over  a  twenty-four  month  period  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  project  work  scope  is  divided between Paxauris, Arizona State University (ASU), and Surfaceink. Paxauris will lead the project and be responsible for the earplug specification, design, and qualification testing. ASU will be responsible for design for materials characterization and prototype fabrication as well as human-subject verification testing.

STATEMENT OF WORK 2.2. 2.2.1.  TASK 1. REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS Aim. Our first task in the Phase II project will be to review the earplug requirements and fill out our specification and test matrix that will guide further system development.  Approach. During the Phase I project, we assembled a list of requirements from the solicitation and other sources, and we identified test methods for each of the requirements. Here we have further divided the test matrix between qualification, verification, and validation tests as defined below:    Qualification: determine whether an earplug or component performs as expected.   Verification: determine whether earplug performance meets specifications.   Validation: determine whether earplug meets army requirements and operational needs. In Table 1these tests are phased between Year 1, Year 2, and a possible follow-on enhancement year when operational validation would take place in the form of a field trial of the earplug prior to acquisition.  During Phase I we also considered what communications systems we should plan to integrate with our system. The Army personnel in attendance at our review noted that at this early stage the level of integration with existing communications systems was up to the supplier and the best approach was to be as broad as possible to increase our potential market. Based on this discussion, we decided to focus on an electronic level-dependent  hear-through  solution  with  a  wireless  link  that  could  be  used  with  a  broad  range  of communications systems. Eliminating wires is important as sound conducted along wires couples directly through the earplug and is a major source of distraction. We plan to use Near Field Magnetic Induction (NFMI) for the wireless modality. Unlike RF, NFMI has limited transmission in air but low absorption by the human body making it well suited to ultra-low-power, robust, and covert body area networks.

Human subject tests  will be planned around the capabilities of the fully equipped audiological testing suite of the ASU Hearing Clinic. 2.2.2.  TASK 2. GEN-I PRODUCTION PROTOTYPE Aim.  The  aim  of  this  task  is  to  revise  the  Phase  I  earplug  design  to  improve  its  performance  and manufacturability and address issues identified during Phase I testing.  Approach.  We  will  optimize  the  earplug  materials  and  inflation  fluid  for  acoustic  performance, environmental suitability, and manufacturability based on  measurements of the relevant material properties and tests to determine their effect on acoustic performance. There are three main areas for improvement: (1)  the low-frequency attenuation of the earplug, (2) magnitude of the occlusion effect, and (3) effect of the acoustic channel on high frequency attenuation. The frequency dependent attenuation and the occlusion effect of a deeply inserted fluidic earplug depends on properties of the inflation fluid including density and viscosity as well as on the thickness and elasticity of the inflatable sheath and its inflation pressure. Our Phase I work demonstrated reasonable results with minimal work to optimize each of these parameters. In Phase II we will complete a series of experiments to optimize each of these variables. In each case we will measure  the  key  characteristics  of  the  fluid  and  sheath  material,  and  we  will  measure  the  acoustic performance of the earplug, including the continuous and impulse attenuation and the occlusion effect.    Fluid Characterization. We will identify a range of potential inflation fluids and measure their viscosity  in  Dr.  Lenore  Dais  materials  laboratory  (Section  3).  ASU  will  also  report  on  the permeation of the fluids through the sheath wall and on the toxicity of the fluids in case of a sheath rupture. In addition, to investigate novel combinations of density, viscosity, and impedance, ASU will prepare and characterize microsphere fluid suspensions, which have the potential to increase and tune the fluidic attenuation of the earplug.    Material Characterization. We will evaluate different materials for the earplug sheath, core and cap in terms of environmental suitability. ASU will conduct accelerated environmental testing for a  subset  of  the  environmental  conditions  specified  in  MIL-STD-810G 1  such  as  fluid contamination, fungus, sand and dust, salt spray, humidity, and temperature. Where relevant, ASU will  also  characterize  the  pre-cure  fluid  characteristics  that  might  affect  material  molding performance during component fabrication.   Design for Manufacture. Paxauris will work with ASU to revise the Phase I design based on the selected materials to facilitate manufacture in production quantities. As with our Phase I work, we will consider both dip molding and injection molding as potential techniques and we will use both ASU facilities and outside shops to conduct fabrication trials.   Design for Assembly. An important part of our production fabrication process will be the method for assembling the earplug components. Key aspects will be a method to assemble the sheath onto the core if it is not directly over-molded onto the core, and a method to inject fluid into the bulb and adhere the bistable cap. ASU will implement this approach in their laboratory and refine it so that it may be easily automated. This will allow us to prepare an assembly line and to estimate the production  costs  of  the  assembled  earplug.  We  will  also  consider  line  tests  to  ensure  earplug quality control and implement these tests in the assembly process where appropriate.   Design for Performance. An advantage of the dip molding method we trialed in Phase I is that the thickness and durometer of the silicone sheath may be varied without retooling. ASU will fabricate sheaths with a range of thickness and hardness and deliver these to Paxauris for performance tests. 1 https://www.atec.army.mil/publications/mil-std-810g/mil-std-810g.pdf  4  Proprietary: Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume.   Topic No. DHA19C-001     Performance Tests. Paxauris will repeat the tests we developed in Phase I using our biofidelic head  simulator  to  measure  attenuation  of  continuous  and  impulse  noise  and  reduction  of  the occlusion effect. The test techniques were described in Section #.  We  expect  a  few  design/build/test  iterations  to  determine  the  optimum  combination  of  material dimensions and silicone hardness. Once we have optimized the design, ASU will fabricate components for twenty-five  earplugs.  Components  for  ten  earplugs  will  be  integrated  with  hear-through  electronics  in Task 3. Ten earplugs will be assembled without electronics and used for qualification testing in Task 4. The remaining components will be held in reserve.      Task Product. The product of this task will be a set of twenty-five Gen-I production prototype earplugs with  materials  and  inflation  fluid  optimized  for  improved  acoustic  performance,  environmental compatibility, and manufacturability. Roles.  ASU  will  be  responsible  for  material  and  fluid  selection  and  characterization,  component fabrication, and earplug assembly. Paxauris will be responsible for earplug design and performance testing.  Materials  and  Equipment.  ASU  has  the  required  facilities  and  equipment  for  material  and  fluid characterization  in  Dr.  Lenore  Dais  laboratory  and  for  component  assembly  in  Dr.  Qiong  Nians laboratory.  ASU  has  some  fabrication  facilities,  but we  expect  ASU  will  largely  outsource  component fabrication. Appropriate sources have been identified and are included as materials and supplies in ASUs cost budget. Paxauris has the acoustic test facility and instrumentation require for the performance tests. We have included costs for renting the head simulator from Creare in our budget.  2.2.3.  TASK 3. ELECTRONICS INTEGRATION Aim. The aim of this task is to develop and integrate an electronic earpiece for enhanced situational awareness and wireless communications.  Approach. In Phase I we prepared a preliminary architecture for an earpiece that provided enhanced situational awareness with a hear-through circuit and wireless communications via an NFMI link. In this task we will implement this circuit and firmware and integrate the earpiece into the earplug developed in Task 2.  Preliminary Architecture Design. Major components in the preliminary architecture presented earlier includes the following components: external microphone, receiver/speaker, and Codec/DSP chip for the hear-through circuit; additional components for communications including a voice pickup microphone and the NFM radio system on chip (SoC), and antenna; and the battery and power management components. We will reconsider each of these components with an aim to maximize commonality with the other hearable development efforts Paxauris has in progress. This will reduce our development efforts and cost while increasing the capabilities of different hearable earpiece components available to the Army. Although we will benefit from this commonality, the work here will be focused on implementation of the hear-through circuit and the NFMI communications link, and so will not duplicate work on the other projects, which are focused on a dosimeter, physiological sensors, and an accelerometer for monitoring blast exposure. As part of this subtask, we will consider sizing, part break-up strategy, power budget, a preliminary bill of materials, and bill of materials costs.  Firmware and Hardware in Loop Testing.  Selection of an appropriate Codec/DSP platform will depend on the bandwidth, bit depth, processing power, and memory required for the hear-through circuit, while still retaining potential for additional capabilities for higher-end models. As part of this development effort, we  will  implement  the  firmware  in  Matlab  Simulink,  port  the  code  onto  the  Codec/DSP  development platform  and  run  a  hardware  in  loop  tests  to  confirm  performance,  processing  power  and  memory requirements. A key performance aspect is the attack time of the gain reduction for high-level impulse noise, so that low-level sounds may be amplified without risk of hearing damage.  Proprietary: Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume. 5  Topic No. DHA19C-001   Electronics Fabrication. Surfaceink will design and layout a hear-through PCB flex circuit with flying leads for the receiver so that it may be installed in the earplug core to reduce the effect of resonances in the acoustic  channel  through  the  core.  Paxauris  will  fabricate  the  circuit  (material  costs  are  included  for fabrication by an outside vendor) and will perform acceptance tests to confirm acoustic performance.  Earplug Integration. Paxauris will design and implement a method for integrating hear-through and communications electronics into the earplug. We will design a benchtop mold and fabricate a cap and inflation bulb into which the earpiece may be inserted. We will then assemble a trial earplug with integrated electronics and test it for fit and function.   Task Product. The result of this task will be a design for the hear-through and communications circuit including component selection, circuit layout, sizing, part break-up strategy, power budget, bill of materials, and volume cost estimate. Prototype PCB flex-circuits will be fabricated and integrated into the earplug using benchtop molds for new earplug soft components.   Roles.  Surfaceink will be responsible for the preliminary architecture, electronic circuit design, and firmware.  Paxauris  will  perform  HIL  simulations,  fabricate  the  circuit,  design,  and  fabricate  new  soft components to interface with the circuit, and test the integration for fit and function.     Materials  and  Equipment.  Surfaceink  has  the  required  facilities,  tools,  and  equipment  for  their component of this task. Paxauris has the equipment and facilities required for molding soft components and integrating the electronics. Material costs are also included for outside vendor fabrication of flex-circuit prototypes, 3D printing of earpiece housings, and CNC machining of molds for soft-components as well as for molding and laboratory supplies. 2.2.4.  TASK 4. PERFORMANCE QUALIFICATION Aim. In this task we will qualify the performance of the earplugs against the specifications identified in Task 1.  Approach. We will perform the qualification test techniques identified for each of the specifications in Task 1. These will involve experimenter evaluations and measurements with the biofidelic head simulator. Human subject testing will not be carried out until Year 2 in Task 5 and Task 7. We also plan to conduct life testing to determine the number of insertion, inflation, deflation, removal cycles an earplug can sustain. These tests will be conducted using an artificial ear and an automated process so that we can test earplugs to failure. We are planning to test five earplugs and estimate 4 cycles per day, five days per week giving 240 cycles for our estimated three-month life. ASU will fabricate prototype earplug components according to the design developed in Task 2 to meet the specifications identified in Task 1. We will assemble the earplugs at Paxauris using the technique developed at ASU for the core and sheath but integrating the hear-through electronics and soft components fabricated in Task 3.   Task Product. This task will produce a set of qualification data describing the earplug performance for each of the specifications.  Roles. Paxauris will be responsible for conducting all testing.  Materials and Equipment. Tests will be conducted in the Paxauris test facility, where we have the required instrumentation and equipment. Costs are included for renting the biofidelic head simulator from Creare. 2.2.5.  TASK 5. FIT POPULATION Aim. The aim of this task is to measure ear canal dimensions for a set of human subjects to determine the range of sizes required for our earplug to fit more than 5% to 95% of our target population.  Approach. While our inflatable earplug is designed to fit  a wide range of ear canal widths and shapes, deep insertion requires close control of earplug length. The shoulder of our earplug bulb seats against the Proprietary: Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume. 6  Topic No. DHA19C-001  concha surface at the ear canal opening. From this base, the length of the stem determines the depth of the seal at the earplug tip. Our goal is for the tip to be positioned within 5 mm of the tympanic membrane, which is the standard insertion depth for probe microphone measurements and will ensure the seal is past the second bend in the bony region where maximum attenuation and minimum occlusion effect is achieved. We therefore need to know a subjects ear canal length in order to fit them with the correct length earplug. And we need to know the expected range of ear canal lengths to determine how many earplug lengths we need to design. As detailed in Section #, for 5% to 95% population the range of ear canal lengths is from 21mm to 29 mm, which we plan to span with three earplug lengths. Considering the importance of length and fit to earplug comfort and performance, we also want to relate data on ear canal dimensions to reported comfort and measured attenuation and occlusion effect in our human subject tests. To do this, we plan to scan the earplug geometry of a population of test subjects and choose a fit-population subset that spans the full range of lengths and widths and has gender and racial diversity. We will follow the test protocol prepared and approved in Task 1. We plan to recruit and measure the ear canals of 40 subjects for this first trial. We will use an Audioscan Verifit 2 hearing instrument analyzer to measure the ear canal depth. As shown in Figure 2, this instrument provides depth feedback while a clinician inserts a microphone probe into the subjects ear canal. Depth estimation is based on a machine-learning algorithm trained on a set of recorded data and validated with in separate data set where probe placement was compared to visually-guided results.2 We will also trial a simple contact method used for determining ear canal depth when inserting Lyric receiver-in-canal (RIC) hearing aids. Finally, we will take an impression of the subjects ear canal using a traditional impression gun and silicone impression cartridge. We will then scan the impressions to create a digital 3d model of each subjects ear canal, and from these scans we will take further dimensional measurements such as height, width, and volume.  Figure 2. Audioscan Verifit Ear Canal Depth Measurement. Left: probe guide placement screen. Right: Validation  results. During this trial we will also assess each candidates suitability for attenuation testing. We will use an otoscope to check whether the subjects ear canal is clean, healthy and thus suitable for testing, ans we will measure their air-conduction pure-tone thresholds using an Otometrics Madsen Astera 2 Audiometer to ensure that the subject has normal hearing. If the candidate presents a suitable ear canal and audiogram, we will fit them with an earplug (foam and/or Paxauris if available) and again use the Audioscan Verifit 2 to measure the earplug attenuation. We will also explore the use of the Verifit 2 occlusion effect measurement option. Informed consent will be obtained before testing, and a questionnaire about earplug comfort and fitting ease will be completed after testing.  2 Folkeard, P., Pumford, J., Pietrobon, J., and Scollie, S., Evaluation Of Probe Guide: Software-assisted Probe Tube Placement In Hearing Aid Fittings, Hearing Review, 26(11), Nov. 2019.   Proprietary: Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the first page of this volume.  7  From these data, we will select a fit population of 20 subjects for verification tests in Task 7. We will also  analyze  these  data  to  determine  an  appropriate  range  of  ear  plug  lengths  to  span  the  5%  to  95% population range, and we will recommend an approach for sizing subjects ear canals for fitting them with Paxauris earplugs. Topic No. DHA19C-001 Figure 3. Ear Canal Depth Sizing Tool.  Task Product. The product of this task will be a fit population of 20 subjects for verification testing in Task 7, guidance on the required range of earplug lengths, and a recommended sizing and fitting technique. Roles. ASU will be responsible for this task. Dr. Kristin Samuelson is the director of the ASU Hearing Clinic and has extensive experience with the various equipment and testing. Materials and Equipment. Human subjects will be tested in the adult audiological testing suite of the ASU Hearing Clinic, which is located on the second floor of Coor Hall on the ASU Tempe Campus. The testing suite has state-of-the-art clinical equipment needed for a comprehensive audiological evaluation of adults. We will schedule subject testing outside of the clinic hours. Testing will be conducted inside a double-walled sound-treated booth using an Otometrics Madsen Astera 2 Audiometer and an Audioscan Verifit 2 hearing instrument analyzer. Costs are included for ear impressions, which can measure the shape of the ear canal very accurately. 2.2.6.  TASK 6. GEN-II PRODUCTION PROTOTYPE Aim. In this task we will revise the Gen-I design based on the results of our Task 4 qualification tests, and we will fabricate a set of Gen-II production prototypes of different lengths with integrated hear-through electronics. Approach.  We  will  revise  our  design  for  the  earplug,  hear-through  electronics,  and  electronics integration scheme based on the results of our Task 4 performance qualification tests. We will then extend the design to the range of lengths determined from the Task 5 fit population. New tooling will be made for these designs and production prototypes will be fabricated for all sizes. New flex circuits and housings will also  be  fabricated  and  the  earplugs  with  integrated  electronics  will  be  assembled  using  a  production representative line. The earplug components and the completed earplugs will be subjected to line tests for quality control. The acoustic performance of the final earplugs will then be qualified in the Paxauris acoustic test facility to make sure the redesign has resolved any issues identified.   Task Product. A set of twenty-five Gen-II production prototypes of each of a range of sizes will result from this task along with qualification test data describing the acoustic performance of the earplugs.  Task Roles. Paxauris will be responsible for the earplug design revision. Surfaceink will be responsible for revising the electronic circuit and firmware. ASU will be responsible for fabricating new earplugs and Paxauris will be responsible for fabricating the electronic earpieces and for assembling and integrating the electronics into the earplugs.

Representative costs have been included in Paxauriss budget for fabrication of the earpiece rigid-flex circuit board and housing and in ASUs budget for fabrication of the earplug soft components including the core, sheath, and cap. 2.2.7.  TASK 7. PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION Aim. In this task we will verify the performance of the Gen-II earplug though human subject tests.  Approach. We will follow the protocol prepared and approved in Task 1. Verification tests will be in accordance with the methods listed in Table 1 and described earlier under Tasks 4 and 5. The earplug insertion loss measurement technique will be based on the procedures described in ANSI S12.42-2010, Methods for the Measurement of Insertion Loss of Hearing Protection Devices in Continuous or Impulsive Noise Using Microphone-in-Real-Ear or Acoustic Test Fixture Procedures. The microphone-in-real-ear (MIRE) method will be used with human test subjects for to measure the earplug insertion loss in continuous noise. The human subject test protocol will include a questionnaire about fit and comfort of the earplug and compatibility with other personal protective equipment (PPE), which will be provided to the subjects. We will also make measurements of the occlusion effect as trialed in Task 5 using the Audioscan Verifit 2. The acoustic test fixture (ATF) method will be used to measure the earplug insertion loss in impulsive noise. In the latter measurement, we plan to use a biofidelic head simulator to capture bone-conduction paths rather than imposing bone-conduction limits after the fact as required by the standard.  Task Product. The product of this task will be a data set verifying the performance of the Gen-II earplug. Roles. All human subject testing will be performed by ASU under the IRB-approved test protocol prepared in Task 1. Testing not involving human subjects will be conducted in the Paxauris laboratory.  Materials and Equipment. Human subjects will be tested in the adult audiological testing suite of the ASU Hearing Clinic, which is located on the second floor of Coor Hall on the ASU Tempe Campus.

Systems of care are fragmented, providing inconsistent and inadequate support. The Family Check-Up is an evidence based parenting program that employs a data-driven, tailored, home visitation approach to address childrens behavioral health through the development of parenting skills and connection with community resources. Based on empirical effects on physical health, we have adapted the program, now called the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), to promote positive health routines related to nutrition, physical activity, sleep hygiene, and screen time, and connect families with preventative healthcare.   Dr. Berkel will oversee work for the current renewal where we will continue working with our established partnership between FTF, Avondale preschool, Family Resource Center, and Bayless integrated healthcare. Families with children aged 2 through 5 can still enter the program through a referral from any of the community partners or self-refer. They will complete a comprehensive assessment that will guide services. An FCU4Health coordinator will conduct a feedback session where they will present the results of the assessment and develop a service plan in collaboration with the families using motivational interviewing. The plan will include information about health and development, parent skill building, and connections with community resources, depending on parent needs and interests. Families will be contacted again, annually, to reassess needs and provide tailored services. The program is now entering the one year follow-up assessment stage with a portion of families who began the program one year ago. We expect to complete the one year follow-up assessment with all families by February of 2022, while continuing services and preparing for the third annual follow-up.   ",

FP00028844,528,,,,,1,,,"Despite significant investments of time, energy, funding and resources harmful behaviors like substance use, violence and suicide persist in the military population and have a significant impact on force readiness and wellness. One of the key challenges with implementing prevention and intervention programming is the often-siloed nature of the implementation of those programs due to funding sources that break down by branch, component, department, priority area, e.g. After over a decade of concerted effort and resources focused on reducing negative impacts on the force and their families, it is clear that even the best and strongest siloed programmingdelivered will not have the intended impact on negative outcomes. This project focuses on an approach that maximizes, interconnects and coordinates all training programs, harm and risk reduction programs, upstream prevention signature behavior programs, resource provision, crisis response, and force management and leadership so that each element can be most effective as part of a comprehensive approach. By maximizing what is already available and adding a layer of coordination and support, the anticipated result is a greater collective impact of all efforts together than each program, resource or initiative can achieve individually. This proposal also takes a cross-cutting approach to prevention that looks at service members and families as whole people who may struggle with multiple, interconnected issues across oneor more social determinants of health. By using a cross-cutting approach that focuses on reducing harmful behaviors and increasing signature behaviors, a greater overall benefit can be seen to the individual and thereby the force as a whole.For the past decade, the Arizona Coalition for Military Families (ACMF) has built partnerships and developed program models to achieve cross-cutting, upstream prevention. These programs have been deployed to the population of service members, veterans and their families statewide in coordination with military, go",
FP00028898,529,,,,,1,,,"Pandemics have historically overwhelmed healthcare delivery systems, leading to calls for greater planning and investment in preparedness. The SARS-CoV-2 experiences reinforced the concerns  that we were not adequately prepared to provide care overall, much less to the most vulnerable. As such, understanding how health systems responded to the pandemic is critical to realize both the state and health system preparedness and the implications for older adult populations. During the outbreak of COVID-19, livery systems, in addition to addressing acute care needs, were forced to play a key public health role.  Nine of the Maricopa County Healthcare Delivery Systems (MCDS) serving 80% of Arizonas population, whose interactions previously have been competitive, formed a Civilian Emergency Medical System to improve preparedness, readiness, response and share best practices. This is an opportune time to learn from this natural experiment: what worked in the planning and management phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what did not. We propose a mixed-methods design that aims to: 1) Identify key factors associated with readiness and evaluate the adequacy of planning within the healthcare systems, 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of Maricopa County hospital systems, outpatient systems. Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and public health in meeting the needs of older adults and individuals living with multimorbidity, and 3) Assess dynamic practice-, organizational-, and system-level factors and practices that facilitated effective responses to COVID-19 particularly in meeting the needs of older adults and those with multimorbidity. Lessons from innovative public-private partnerships in Arizona during COVID-19, learning from pandemic experience, and successful management strategies, will all inform developing a next generation public health model and a revised playbook for future age-friendly pandemic preparedness and responsiveness.",

FP00028914,532,,,,,1,,,"Capacity area: Strategic Partnerships; Geographic scope: ArizonaSummary of the proposed activities: This project aims to build and strengthen public health relationships by developing a state level maternal child health community of practice to share emerging needs between stakeholders across multiple sectors, focused on the impacts of COVID19 on maternal and infant health. We have identified the need to create an integrated system of care coordination between maternal and infant health providers and community support organizations in support of the fourth Trimester phase of life. The project will build upon existing regional partnerships with families, providers and community support organizations. To sustain the core component of this project, the recipient will maintain relationships with these stakeholders to monitor future emerging issues and provide relevant guidance and best practices. Emerging issue: Postpartum maternal and infant health challenges for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) populations and how they have been exacerbated by COVID-19.MCH population affected: Mothers and infants in the first year postpartum. Specific, measurable project objectives: In our first goal, we will engage new and existing maternal and infant health partners in a cross-disciplinary network to improve health outcomes for mother/infant dyads. In order to accomplish this, we will: Convene quarterly Ecosystem Advisory Board meetings; Implement 10 online Lunch and Learn conversations featuring experts and/or parents speaking about emerging MCH needs; Establish Regional Support Coalitions (RSC) for 5 existing 4th Trimester Villages; Implement 2 statewide 4th Trimester Ecosystem Convenings to engage MCH practitioners in discussion of emerging needs; Cultivate 3 additional 4th Trimester Villages and establish RSC in Cochise County, North Maricopa County, and the Tohono OOdham Region for a total of 8 regional Villages. We will identify emerging issues surrounding the downstream impacts of COVID19 on mother/baby dyads in the first year postpartum. In order to accomplish this goal, we have 5 objectives: Conduct COVID Impact on MCH survey of parents, regional leaders, community health workers, maternal and child healthcare providers in all 8 Villages; Host quarterly Listening Sessions with new parents in at least 5 Village regions (20 total); Host 4 leadership meetings convening Village leaders to share data gathered at listening sessions; Gather feedback on emerging issues at 10 community lunchtime conversations. Finally, in our last goal, we aim to serve as a hub to connect organizations to better respond to emerging issues and integrate social support and health care services. Again, there are five objectives to accomplish this goal: Share out summaries of emerging needs thorough regional hub leadership, ecosystem meetings and monthly lunchtime conversations; Disseminate best practice approaches to the emerging issues identified to regional and state stakeholders at 2 statewide Convenings, and at 10 statewide Lunch and Learn conversations; Connect researchers and practitioners through the MCH Translational Research Team to meaningfully analyze and document challenges and interventions in the fourth trimester; Develop key messaging to help mothers advocate for mental and physical health needs that may have been impacted by the COVID19 pandemic; and, Execute social media campaigns to communicate key messaging materials directly to mothers.",
FP00028945,533,,,,,1,,,"Opioid overdose deaths continue to rise, yet efficacious medications to treat opioid use disorder, such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, remain vastly underutilized. In particular, few providers eligible to prescribe buprenorphine obtain a waiver to do so; of those who do, many do not go on to prescribe or neglect to prescribe to patient capacity. Nurse practitioners stand poised to serve as frontline buprenorphine providers in the opioid epidemic, and address the medication-assisted treatment (MAT) provider shortage. To this end, we propose the Arizona State University (ASU) Waiver Expansion, or AWE, program. AWE program leadership propose to train 75 Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students per year, for a total of 225 new ASU DNP nursing graduates across three years who will be well positioned to secure the buprenorphine waiver post-graduation. Additional program goals and objectives include: 1) building internal faculty capacity for ongoing buprenorphine waiver student instruction, training a minimum of six nursing faculty to become buprenorphine waiver instructors; 2) establishing formal relationships with a minimum of 10 community-based practica and internship sites which deliver opioid use disorder treatment to provide experiential student learning opportunities, placing 10-20 students per year at these sites; 3) providing ongoing technical assistance and implementation support to new MAT practitioners at the pre-service and post-graduate levels using proven workforce development models (e.g., Project ECHO) by recruiting a minimum of 30 students and graduates to the MAT ECHO program; and 4) measuring program success through systematic longitudinal tracking of prescribing practices and waiver attainment by nurse practitioner students post-graduation.

As part of this program, the collaborative will hire new behavioral health providers to serve in integrated primary care teams at participating outpatient clinics, train new and current staff in evidence-based SBIRT practices and SUD treatment, establish SUD and behavioral health screening and referral protocols, establish partnerships with community behavioral health and specialty treatment agencies, and collect baseline and ongoing data from program participants to establish efficacy and ensure quality adherence.",
FP00029015,536,,,,,1,,,"Biomedical informatics and data science [1-6] has become one of the most active and exciting research areas in biomedical and health sciences, bringing unprecedented opportunities that combine computing, statistics, and information sciences to address the challenges in translational biomedical research, patient care, healthcare delivery systems, as well as community, population, and public health. At the center of biomedical informatics and data science is its fundamental theories, models, methods, techniques, and processes, which consist the core components of this multi-disciplinary scientific field [7]. Meanwhile, the applications of biomedical informatics and data science continue to grow rapidly, ranging from computational -omics [8] and electronic health records (EHRs) [9-10] to detection of disease outbreaks [11] and promotion of heath behaviors through ubiquitous computing [12]. Biomedical informatics and data science have played a critical role in many prominent research programs, for example, All of Us [13], Cancer Moonshot [14], Clinical & Translational Science Awards (CTSA) [15], Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) [16], mHealth [17], Dissemination & Implementation (D&I) Research in Health [18], Learning Health Systems [19], the response to the COVID-19 pandemics [11], and the upcoming Bridge2AI program [20]. It is obvious that this trend will continue and therefore the needs of well-trained future generations of biomedical informaticians and data scientists are expected to soar. In response to these needs, biomedical informatics and data science training will have to address both the core sciences and the wide range of biomedical and health applications. The proposed ASU research training program in biomedical informatics and data science will build on our existing graduate degree programs, bring various expertise and resources from across the ASU and the partners in the metro-Phoenix area, enhance the curriculum, and consolidate the training and career pathways for pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and short-term trainees with diverse backgrounds.",

FP00029032,539,,,,,1,,,"Background and Significance: Behavioral health disorders (BHDs) are common in the United States. Approximately 20% of adults live with a mental illness, 5% of adults live with a severe mental illness (SMI), and almost 4% of adults with a mental illness experience a co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD). Although approximately 25% of the adult population experience mental health symptoms and many receive inadequate care, there is a substantial evidence gap in establishing more effective strategies to provide patient-centered care for these patients. There is strong potential for the findings of this study to improve the quality of evidence to help reduce disparities and improve outcomes for patients with BHDs.Study Aims: The goal of the proposed research is to expand the evidence base to improve outcomes and reduce disparities for persons with behavioral health disorders (BHDs) through a multilevel healthcare system approach. The aims include: Aim 1. Compare the effectiveness of a patient-centered, integrated behavioral health and primary care (BHPC) approach to address the social determinants of health (SDoH) for persons with BHDs to care as usual. Aim 2. Compare implementation outcomes of a patient centered, integrated BHPC approach to address SDoH for persons with BHDs to care as usual. Study Description: Study Design: The study is a quasi-experimental effectiveness-implementation hybrid (Type 2) design with matched controls. There will be one comparison group (Arm 0) and two intervention groups (Arm 1 and Arm 2). Components & Comparators: Arm 0 will receive treatment as usual and will serve as the comparison group for the study. Usual care is defined as care that does not have access to services provided as part of the pilot project. Treatment as usual is based on clinical standards from various professional societies and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). No services will be denied or withheld from any individual in Arm 0. Arm 1 will include patient-specific care monitoring, reporting, and coordination. It includes primary care and behavioral health clinics with no prior participation in the pilot project. Arm 1 involves the following technology interventions: required bidirectional data exchange with the HIE, a data dashboard at the organizational level, coherent patient panels, and a uniform real-time patient attribution approach. The organizational processes within and across healthcare settings for Arm 1 include: participation in a learning collaborative and technical assistance. Arm 2 will only include providers that have participated in the pilot project. The intervention will include ARM 1 interventions, SDOH risk stratification with care coordination based on SDOH risk-level, and a closed loop referral system to connect providers with community-based organizations and improve coordination with warm hand-offs. Arm 2s technology interventions are the same as Arm 1. Likewise, the organizational processes within and across healthcare settings for Arm 2 include those in Arm 1 supplemented with SDoH screening and the closed loop referral system. Study Population: The study setting consists of a multilevel healthcare system approach. There are a total of 2.3 million members covered by the Arizona Medicaid program with a network of 377 primary care and behavioral health provider organizations. The study population consists of the behavioral health and primary care provider organizations (health systems, hospitals, provider clinics) and the matched control Arm 0 serving Medicaid members in Arizona and their members. The total sample size for the CER analysis is 150 with 50 in Arm 0, 50 in Arm 1, and 50 in Arm 2.Outcomes & Timeframe: The outcomes for Aim 1 include: Primary Outcomes (1-year follow-up): patient satisfaction and well-being, use of social services, patient engagement level, anxiety/depression symptoms and medication adherenceSecondary Outcomes (1-year follow-up): hospital readmission rate for mental illness, 7-day & 30-day follow-up after hospitalization, metabolic monitoring, diabetic screeningThe outcomes for Aim 2 include:  Primary Outcomes (1-year follow-up): care continuity, acceptability of intervention, feasibility of closed loop referral system, appropriateness of intervention for patients, behavioral health and primary care integration",

The ASU-EHF collaboration is supported by a $4.7Maward (3U54MD002316-14S1) from the NIH RADx-UP Initiative. The current demonstrationgrant Advancing Health Literacy to Enhance Equitable Community Responses toCOVID-19 provides a timely opportunity to use the existing RADx-UP community healthworker framework to develop interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and healthliteracy strategies. By forming strategic collaborations with the RADx-UP research teamworking in the same geographic areas and with the same populations, we will be able toleverage the programs experience in community-engaged research, communication andoutreach to efficiently disseminate interventions that demonstrate effectiveness forreducing disparities and increasing health literacy.The RADx team assists underserved communities across Arizona. Intervention sites areidentified using Integrative Resource Mapping (IRM), a GPS-based data platform withmulti-layers of data showing epidemiological COVID-19 cases and zip code level census data ofsocial determinants of health, to identify communities with the greatest vulnerabilities andbarriers to testing. Initially, 46 zip codes were identified as testing deserts, and those zip codeswere considered for interventions. A Community and Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB)comprised of 12 community leaders and 4 scientists, reviews this epidemiology data and guidesdecision-making and prioritizing communities.  By collaborating with Equality HealthFoundation and its network of nonprofit health providers, we have strengthened the socialinfrastructure to help communities by meeting them where they are and listening to their needs.This cross-sectoral team has developed a culturally congruent community health worker (CHW)led COVID-19 testing outreach intervention, leveraging the cultural and social capitalaccumulated through a history of equitable research partnerships.Our partner, Equality Health, expands access to high-quality care by empowering payers andproviders to deliver an exceptional patient experience, while lowering cost of care andimproving clinical outcomes. The goal is to ensure all people receive high-quality care thatimproves and enhances their lives regardless of race, ethnicity, age or income. Equality Healthhas an extensive network of community partners and stakeholders who will be criticallyimportant for implementing testing, education, outreaching and vaccine efforts.Arizona State University is a Hispanic-Serving Institution, assuming fundamental responsibilityfor the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves. The researchteam collectively has decades of experience working with underserved communities acrossArizona. We have significant experience conducting rigorous research designs (e.g.,randomized controlled trials, stepped wedge designs, interrupted time series, and adaptivedesigns) to address scientific questions about COVID-19 among underserved and vulnerablepopulations. We also have experience with quasi-experimental designs and mixed methodsresearch, training, and program evaluation. Most recently, the team has worked in Phoenix,Maryvale, Guadalupe, San Carlos, San Luis, and Yuma.Describe how your programs are innovative and address a community need as it pertains toaddressing health disparities and health literacy.Our model improves access to diagnosis, treatment, and other clinical services through aninnovative data-driven process. By relying on Integrative Resource Mapping, which embeds 11layers of data, including available testing sites, medical facilities, public transportationinfrastructure, major businesses, schools, etc., we can monitor and identify testing andvaccination deserts across Arizona. ADHS provides biweekly updates on testing numbers andconfirmed COVID-19 cases stratified by race/ethnicity, zip code, and social determinants ofhealth. Our community advisory board then reviews the data, identifies priority areas based onlocalized knowledge and experience. The CHWs, along with Equality Health then plan andimplement CHW-led COVID-19 testing events, identify key stakeholders in targetcommunities, coordinate and involve public, non-profit and corporations and then do promotionand advertisement via multiple channels.We recognize that different settings require different approaches. The team has coordinated andprovided outreach and clinical services at multiple levels of the social ecosystem using varioustesting models to meet the hardest to reach community members where they are. We haveconducted large drive-up events in local parks or community centers, door-to-door testing andcontact tracing in HUD housing units, and walk-up events near mass transit for migrantfarmworkers. In each cycle, there is an attempt to reach specific racial and ethnic minorities.As an academic institution, we are uniquelypositioned to include students, faculty, andstaff in community-engaged research andservice projects. The ASU Student OutbreakResponse Team (SORT) has served as aninnovative public health training programand flexible surge workforce for state, local,and tribal public health partners for six years.SORT students work to collect data andconduct analyses for health departmentsrelated to outbreak investigations as well asperform routine surveillance activities forcommunicable diseases. At the start of theCOVID-19 pandemic, SORT quickly pivotedfrom a small in-person public health trainingprogram to a large rapid response teamcomposed of 500+ faculty, staff, students,and community volunteers across fourworking teams to mitigate the impact of thepandemic on our community: 1) AZ-specificpredictive modeling and data analytics team to track COVID-19 trends and healthcare capacity(Modeling Emerging Threats in Az (METAz Team)); 2) serosurvey field team going door-to-dooracross Maricopa County to offer antibody tests to randomly selected households and assess ourprogress toward herd immunity (COVID-19 Serosurvey Team); 3) specialized field epidemiologyunit that can be deployed to hard-hit communities as needed (COVID-19 Community ResponseTeam); and a 4) virtual call center conducting case investigations and contact tracing (COVID-19Case Investigation Team (CIT)). The Case Investigation Team operates 7 days a week, 11 hoursper day, is staffed by 250+ students and community volunteers who speak 11 languages andcome from a multitude of disciplinary backgrounds. This CIT serves as the foundation fromwhich the ASU COVID-19 Community Response Team operates with fully integratedprogramming, data sharing, recruitment & training programs, and quality improvementprocesses. The CIT has completed 40,000 COVID-19 case investigations on behalf of MaricopaCounty Department of Public Health and the Pascua Yaqui Tribe.The ASU COVID-19 Community Response Team has been deployed to Guadalupe, Arizonafor the past 10 months under contract with Maricopa County Department of Public Health(FP00025482) that runs through June 2021. The team is a diverse and multidisciplinary groupof ASU faculty, staff, and students with expertise in global health, epidemiology, and socialwork. The field epidemiology team conducts door-to-door case investigations and contacttracing and needs assessments, delivers supplies to support safe home isolation, providesreferrals for temporary housing and home-based testing, and supports community testing andvaccination events. The unique needs of this community necessitated innovatingcommunity-specific public health interventions. These solutions ranged from community-widetesting blitzes, mobile health services, at-home testing, temporary shelters for quarantining,and culturally tailored health messaging. Given the number of multi-generational households inGuadalupe, home isolation and/or quarantining is nearly impossible. The team quickly adaptedour disease monitoring systems to focus on households and not simply individual cases. At-riskfamily members were offered temporary housing for quarantine and isolation periods. Otherinnovations included asking for contacts at the time of testing (rather than after the test resultscame back) which significantly increased our ability to quickly identify contacts and supportthem in quarantine.Each step of a public health outbreak investigation requires complex adaptive data managementsystems requiring rapid and effective communications between organizations. We have builtcustom IT solutions to share data securely between the county, community partners, tribalpartners, and ASU while protecting privacy and confidentiality. The value of transparency andexplicitness about how those data systems are being managed, and the resulting use of the data toinform community response, is critically important for building trust.The Public Health Education Team conducted market research to determine what materials andmessaging were needed and how to best reach communities of interest. They sought responsesfrom community resources and healthcare providers  such as Phoenix Housing, Terros Health,Open Hearts AZ, and Valleywise Health  that work directly with identified vulnerablecommunities. The responses collected showed a need for educational aids that use simplelanguage to explain COVID-19 safety information, content that can be shared digitally andphysically, and materials that reflect diversity in both English and Spanish. The Public HealthEducation Specialist performed supplemental research to identify what public health educationwork was already being done in communities of interest and who was doing it. This researchincluded social media and website audits of community leaders and influential organizations.Based on findings, the Public Health Education Specialist curated a collection of materials foruse within Arizonas vulnerable communities. All content was either obtained from reliableresources like the CDC, or created by the Public HealthEducation Specialist to fill informational gaps. Materialsinclude videos, infographics, factsheets, and social mediatoolkits sorted by target audience into folders housed on adigital drive. Shareable links to these folders allow easyaccess to share and downloadable files from anywhere withan internet connection. All materials are closely reviewedand vetted by the Public Health Education Team and keptup-to-date to reflect the latest CDC recommendations.To disseminate materials to communities of interest, thePublic Health Education Team created contact lists for eachdefined target audience. Once contact was made andmaterials were shared with those on the list, they were askedto share names of people or organizations they believedcould also use the materials. The initial contact list broke outlike a tree diagram that branched across entire communities. In the Yuma area, leaders fromYuma Counseling Services, Light House Ministry, and Catholic Community Services ofSouthern Arizona, among others, received and passed along materials. In South Phoenix, highlyengaged leadership of The National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Black Nurses Association,First Institutional Baptist Church, and many others welcomed and helped further circulatematerials to community members.This dissemination process continues, following closely with testing cycles to create more buzzaround testing and public health recommendations simultaneously. With the addition of originaleducational materials encouraging testing, even as vaccination availability increases across thestate, the Public Health Education Team is able to convey a critical public service message thatisnt broadly shared otherwise. Overall, this outreach and dissemination work has increasedawareness and attendance for testing events in communities of interest.Aggregate data and anecdotal learnings were shared at the Social Embeddedness Conference.Media coverage about testing events have helped to highlight disparities and to promote testingand education in target communities. Post-event communication to participating communitiesincludes an event summary that reports on total tests administered, positivity rates, CHWservices coordinated and other community snapshot data to inform local leaders of communitystatus and needs.Describe your work with the community health worker model and how you work within thisstructure to address health disparities and health literacy.Community embeddedness is grounded in theprinciples of mutual respect, bi-directionalcommunications, and a shared interest inaddressing community needs and issues.Establishing and sustaining a communitypresence is important for cultivating theinterpersonal relationships and trust that areessential to effective socially embedded work. We apply a holistic perspective to communitypublic health, expanding the activities and supports available, nurturing our presence andacceptance in the community. We work with promotoras, community health workers, and othercommunity stakeholders, establishing systems and strategies of case investigating and contacttracing that meet the unique social and cultural context of the communities in which we work.Because CHWs often have shared attributes relevant to illness management and socioculturalpathways of accessing health care, they have two important strengths in addressing barriers tocare that underserved community members have to overcome. First, the communityembeddedness of CHWs improves patients willingness to accept an offer to participate intherapeutic activities designed to alter target outcomes. Patients reported higher trust towardCHWs and perceived empathy by CHWs during therapeutic contacts. Another ingredient forsuccessful intervention by CHWs is empowerment of patients from underserved communities,aiming to improve self-determination, to help leverage and mobilize social support, and to findsolutions to overcome barriers to care. CHWs have the ability to support patients overcome thebarriers and stressors which disenfranchise them or that may be currently experiencing,potentially facilitating vicarious modeling in dealing challenges created by social determinants ofhealth.In our work, we use a multi-level CHW led intervention to address vaccine hesitancy. Thismodel includes four levels: 1) Cognition and Motivation- we use brief motivationalinterviewing to help a member to explore roadblocks to reach vaccination; 2) Social Norms andInterpersonal Information- we use a concentric circle to help portray of vaccine-focused healthdiscussion networks and assess social norms and information to which they have been exposedto regarding vaccination; 3) Cultural Acceptance- we match CHWs sharing the same ethnicbackground, speaking the same language, to provide culturally tailored vaccinationinformation; 4) Barriers in Built-In Environment- we offer Wi-Fi access and transportationservices to reserve vaccinations at local health care partners and provider reminder services. Todate, the ASU RADx-UP team has trained and contracted 32 CHWs. The work is connectedwith biweekly meetings to the COVID-19 Coalition of Communities of Color Partners(CCCCP) to allow lessons learned to be shared and coordination with other community testingand vaccine efforts.To provide ongoing education and implementation support to the community health workersproviding services within this project, ASU will launch a COVID-19 Health Literacy trainingprogram. The COVID-19 Health Literacy training program would target community healthworkers, Promotoras, and other front-line providers, delivering the frontline interventions. Theprogram will meet weekly to serve as an ongoing training and technical assistance mechanism.The program will be leveraged to ensure fidelity to the identified program protocols and policiesspecific to this project as well as established evidence-based practices. It will also serve as amedium for interventionists to troubleshoot implementation or workflow challenges and shareemerging best-practices. Each telehealth session will include a COVID-19 healthliteracy-focused didactic, such as utilizing translators in vaccine hesitancy, brief interventions,culturally-appropriate contract tracing practices, or racial disparities in COVID-19 testing.Didactic presentations will be followed by a real-life case presentation, presented by aparticipating community health worker. The community health worker will receiverecommendations from the entire learning community. As an incentive to participate,programming will be provided free and health workers will be provided with complimentarycontinuing education credits.The COVID-19 Health Literacy program will be evaluated on an ongoing and continuous basismeasuring participant satisfaction, as well as changes in knowledge, skills, and confidence.Surveys will be administered after every telehealth session to capture understanding of topics,while a post-retro survey will be administered every 6-months to capture depth of understanding,changes in confidence and knowledge over time, and integration of skills into practice.For the ASU COVID-19 Community Response Team, two promotoras serve as the main pointsof contact for the community for health-based communication. The promotoras work side byside with the field epidemiology team. These paraprofessionals leverage their shared identityand trust of fellow community members. Their highly-respected role in the community allowsthem to promote culturally-appropriate health information and guidance to improve overallcommunity health and well-being. They translate when needed and provide critical insights tothe field team that increase the overall effectiveness of the public health interventions, such ascontact tracing (they advise on how to reach community members, when to call, when toapproach the houses, who recentlyattended large gatherings, etc.). Thepromotoras also assist the ASU teamwith the development of public healthmessaging. The field team hasdeveloped messaging about caseinvestigation, contact tracing,vaccines, and availablecommunity/state resources for thoseimpacted by COVID-19. Thesemessages are vetted for relevance,cultural sensitivity, and reading levelbefore they are distributed via thetowns communication channels andin-home delivery boxes. The teamalso works with the community todevelop special events such as achildrens art contest to promoteCOVID-19 vaccination.The goal of the GCRT is to develop a community-focused program to enhance COVID-19surveillance and deliver systematic health communications and resources to the community inorder to slow the spread of COVID-19. We utilized multiple, diverse datasets to formativelyevaluate (and iteratively improve) the program, and developed performance and outcomeindicators as well as assessments of collaboration and engagement.Contact tracing and case investigation are evidence-based public health mitigation strategies. Weadopted and integrated well-defined case investigation and contact tracing performance metricsinto our program evaluation, including: the number of individuals contacted, the number ofindividuals interviewed, and the number of close contacts an individual identifies. In addition tothese outcome measures, we also tracked team performance metrics such as cycle time (i.e., theamount of time it took to reach a case once assigned to us). To ensure equity in cycle time forSpanish-speaking and non-Spanish speaking cases, we tracked and compared metrics for bothgroups over several weeks, and responded to disparities by increasing the number ofSpanish-speaking staff. The cultural and community receptivity of these public health practiceswithin the community of Guadalupe is also reflected by qualitative indicators of engagement,participation, and communication among and between community partners. In addition to publichealth indicators of program impact, we used surveys and focus groups to assess program impacton students and volunteers who engaged in the project. We undertook each of theseevidence-based interventions of case investigation and contact tracing in order to reduce healthdisparities in Guadalupe.The major accomplishment of the GCRT is that incidence of new cases decreased from a level5.5 times higher than the county average to a level equivalent to that of the surroundingMaricopa county. Additionally, contact tracing has improved 5-fold from 0.25 contacts elicitedper case to 1.25 contacts elicited per case. The team has supported 308 families through isolationand organized 11 community events to help bring testing and vaccines into the community. Thecurrent first-dose vaccination rate in Guadalupe is 44% as compared to the state average of36%.Ensuring more equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine will be a meaningful step inmitigating the disparate impacts of the pandemic and limiting health disparities in the future.Overall, the team has made significant progress in addressing disparities in access to COVID-19in groups with high SVI and low digital literacy.",

FP00029092_Res1,543,,,,,1,,,"Genomics science gives us a better understanding of the interactions between genes and the environment, thus allowing researchers to find better ways to improve health and prevent diseases. The in-person Training in Genomics Research (TiGeR) Track will engage students from under-represented populations, such as those from racial and/or ethnic minority groups, people with disabilities, those from sexual and gender minority groups, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The program will target qualified candidates from these under-represented communities with undergraduate degrees in computer science, mathematics, or statistics with limited or no experience working with genomics datasets.  The TiGeR Track programs main goal is to prepare students for successful careers as computational experts in genomics research. This goal will be accomplished through our targeted recruitment and retention efforts within the two-year graduate curriculum culminating in a masters degree in biological data science with a concentration on genomics research. The TiGeR Track will be integrated into our recently established Masters in Biological Data Science (MSBDS) degree program. The MSBDS is an interdisciplinary program that capitalizes on the three pillars of specialty within the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences (SMNS) at Arizona State University (ASU) West: computer science, life sciences, and mathematics. However, the MSBDS currently has no focus on genomics research nor bioinformatics, and the TiGeR Track will help fill this gap. In addition to extensive course work and supervised hands-on research activities, the TiGeR students will be trained on ASUs high-performancecomputing resources and in AnVIL (Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space) - a cloud-based platform for computational genomics, as well as other genomics toolsets using publicly available datasets and repositories. Combining a strong focus on genomics research and large-scale data analytics skills will equip our TiGeR graduates to be immediate and valuable contributors to industry by attaining research positions in the genomics science sector.  We will target, recruit, and retain a diverse pool of students to develop into the next generation's thought leaders in genomics sciences. By recruiting students that represent the communities surrounding our institution, we will maximize deeper ties with surrounding communities at the regional level and generate a diverse science workforce that can compete globally. The TiGeR Track program will provide a model of interdisciplinary collaboration in genomics sciences among faculty within SMNS and other stakeholders on and off-campus. To be prepared to undertake a career in genomics science, the TiGeR Track graduates require a strong foundation of skilled creativity and the ability to identify and achieve scientific goals of significance to the biomedical and biosciences research enterprise. Throughout their tenure in the TiGeR Track program, the students will develop skills to utilize and analyze genomic datasets from the public domain in a research laboratory setting. While a robust interdisciplinary and immersive instruction structure is already present for data science training within the MSBDS degree program, additional resources are required to establish the genomics science curriculum, particularly in a way that will support students from under-represented backgrounds.",
FP00029131,544,,,,,1,,,"  Project Summary/Abstract High quality (pre)clinical research relies on the use of high quality biospecimens; without the latter it is impossible to have the former. Unfortunately, cancer-relevant clinical analytes from all major biomolecular classes exhibit instability when the plasma or serum (P/S) in which they reside is temporarily exposed to thawed conditions (i.e., temperatures > -30 C). Though the percentage of biomolecules that exhibit instability under commonly encountered thawed conditions is generally low (e.g. 2-20%), the number of genuine biomarkers waiting to be discovered is orders of magnitude lowermeaning that in mistreated samples the number of false leads (i.e., potential false discoveries) is orders of magnitude greater than the number of bona fide biomarkers waiting to be found. For this reason, every year, poor pre-analytical sample handling and storage generate unacceptably large numbers of costly false leads in biomedical research. Unsurprisingly, experts in the field agree that this problem must be minimized immediately. Under NCI (IMAT) support (R33CA217702) we recently developed a simple, inexpensive, rapid assay requiring 10 L of P/S known as S-Cys-Albumin that provides an estimate of the amount of time that archived plasma or serum samples have spent at the equivalent of room temperature. This assay works very well but it requires an expensive liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) instrument and user expertise to run it. The need for LC-MS limits its availability to most biomedical research labs which further dis-incentivizes its use beyond the limited incentives that most investigators already have to conduct quality control (QC) analysis on their P/S samples. Fortuitously, we have discovered that the ex vivo biochemistry that governs the S-Cys-Albumin marker can be accessed via plate reader-based absorbance or fluorescence measurements. Converting the S-Cys-Albumin assay to a plate reader-based format would put P/S QC at the fingertips of nearly all biomedical research scientists. As such, the goal of this project is to develop and analytically validate plate reader-based absorbance and fluorescence assays that effectively substitute for the S-Cys-Albumin assay. This will be done via two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop plate reader-based absorbance and fluorescence assays that, by quantifying low molecular weight thiol and disulfide-bearing molecules in P/S, will be able to detect exposure of plasma and serum specimens to thawed conditions (i.e., temperatures > -30 C). Specific Aim 2: A) Analytically characterize the assays and perform an initial analytical validation of them. B) Conduct a small population survey of fresh P/S samples and time course aliquots thereof from GI cancer patients and cancer-free age/gender matched controls to begin to link these assays to P/S exposure time to thawed conditions at -20 C, 4 C, and 23 C.

FP00029134,545,,,,,1,,,"ABSTRACT  The cost of the opioid epidemic in the U.S. now exceeds $500 billion annually, with overdoses claiming 50,000 U.S. lives in 2019 alone. To counter this crisis, accurate and timely opioid monitoring methods are needed that show good coverage not just at national and state levels but also at local community levels. Opioid problems are concentrated  in  specific  communities,  and  community  opioid  data  are  critical  for  guiding  community  leaders, shaping local programmatic implementations, and steering policymaking. Unfortunately for communities, their progress  is  hampered  by  opioid  use  and  misuse  data  that  are  (i)  inaccurate  and  incomplete  or  unknown,  (ii) geospatially coarse, (iii) difficult to access given strict data accessibility rules, and (iv) delayed, with time lags of a year or more. These critical bottlenecks, that are common to many U.S. substance-use and community-health challenges in general, will be addressed in a first-of-its-kind research study by example of opioid misuse in the city of Tempe, AZ by (i) using an innovative, validated wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) method to quantify population-level opioid and other (non-opioid) drug consumption in near real-time at the city and local community level monthly for 3 years; (ii) testing whether WBE data signficiantly improve prediction of opioid overdoses and deaths in the city, thereby enabling cities to better track the trajectory of the opioid crisis and evaluate intervention effectiveness;  (iii)  working  with  city  stakeholders  from  multiple  sectors  to  optimize  the  worlds  first  real-time interactive, community-codesigned online dashboard that synthesizes community-specific WBE data on opioid and other substance use; and (iv) assessing how stakeholders are using WBE dashboard information to combat the  opioid  crisis,  and  other  concerning  drug  trends,  in  their  community.  Extensive  preliminary  data  by  the proposing multi-disciplinary team demonstrate the feasibility and potential value of this first municipal-academic partnership of its kind, in which a U.S. city (Tempe, AZ) determines in wastewater the types and quantities of licit and illicit opioids and other drugs of abuse consumed at the community level. Over the course of five years, the team will optimize access and dissemination of this novel data source conveying information on citywide and local community substance use; determine whether WBE data improve prediction of the opioid crisis relative to conventional data sources alone (i.e., prescription opioid volume); and ascertain how this new information source affects community stakeholders responses to effectively fight the opioid crisis locally. The new tool will be easily scalable and, in addition to combating the opioid crisis, will address other substance-use and community-health challenges, such as community SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. A sustainability plan is in place to ensure continued access, use, and community benefiting from the new tools following award completion. ",
FP00029151,546,,,,,1,,,"Social communication skills are critical treatment targets of behavioral or pharmacological therapies; however, current evaluation instruments are coarse measures of a broad set of social symptoms, time-consuming to administer, and unlikely to be sensitive to change in short trials [1]. These limitations have been highlighted by several failed clinical trials in ASD that target social communication skills, including the recent Arbaclofen trial [2], where it was observed that a central challenge for ASD trials is the absence of outcome measures that have been shown to be sensitive and specific to change in social symptoms with medication treatment.We propose a panel of fine-grained and objective measures of speech and language production that underlie social communication skills and can be collected in-clinic or at-home using mobile technology. PIs Berisha and Liss have developed a panel of speech and language measures (PSLM) and validated it for neurodegenerative disease [14  19]. This thermometer for speech algorithmically and remotely assesses speech along multiple dimensions including, motor control, prosody, cognitive-linguistics, and affect [19  26] - all of which are important factors in social communication. The PSLM has already been adopted as a secondary endpoint in clinical trials in neurology by large pharmaceutical companies (in several languages and continents) and by neurologists at Mayo Clinic and the Barrow Neurological Institute. It should be noted that, while the PSLM was developed and validated in neurodegenerative disease, the measures and analytics themselves are condition-agnostic. For example, the PSLM can document reduced prosodic variation in speech (monotone, robotic sounding), whether the cause is Parkinsons disease [27], ASD [28] or depression [29]. In this study, interpretation of the speech and language metrics will be viewed through the lens of ASD (see Fig. 1).This proposal represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between Arizona State University (ASU: Berisha, Liss, Braden) and the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center (SARRC: Matthews, Smith) to validate the PSLM in adolescents (between ages 13 and 18) diagnosed with ASD. Our preliminary data provides strong evidence that the PSLM is reflective of clinically-relevant changes in social behavior and is sensitive to intervention-related change. In this proposal, we will:SA1: Implement the PSLM in a mobile application, characterize the inter-trial variability of the outcomes, and establish its concurrent validity with a set of psychometrically sound measures of social communication.Approach: We will develop a mobile application for eliciting speech and implement a framework for evaluating the PSLM on the collected data. In collaboration with SARRC, we will collect speech samples in-clinic using a mobile application (at two time points) from 30 adolescents (13-18 years-old) diagnosed with ASD and for a group of matched neurotypical controls (n=30). For each participant we will also measure the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2), the Vineland Expressive Communication and Interpersonal Relationships Subdomains (Vineland-3), and the Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) Social Skills Subdomain (see Fig. 6 for description of measures). We will evaluate the test-retest reliability of the PSLM in both groups and identify the variables with concurrent validity relative to core ASD symptoms (ADOS-2) and other existing widely-accepted outcomes (Vineland-3, SSIS).Impact: This analysis will demonstrate the reliability and validity of the PSLM for ASD and inform trial design in SA2.SA2: Compare the sensitivity of the PSLM in detecting clinically-meaningful differences resulting from the PEERS intervention against the sensitivity of two widely used and psychometrically sound measures.Approach: Compare the pre- to post-intervention change in PSLM for adolescents with ASD randomly assigned to the PEERS curriculum (n=30) [5, 6]; or a delayed treatment control group (DTC; n=30). Compare the effect size of the PEERS measured by the PSLM panel (both within-subject and relative to the DTC group) against the effect size of the PEERS measured by the Vineland-3 expressive language and interpersonal communication subdomains, as well as the SSIS social skills domain. Comparisons of the minimal clinically important difference obtained through these measures will also be performed.Impact: This will establish the sensitivity of PSLM to detect clinically-meaningful differences in one of the most well-studied social skill interventions and provide strong evidence that the PSLM is suitable as an interventional endpoint.SA3: Demonstrate the feasibility of the PSLM as a reliable at-home measure and examine sex and age differences by disseminating the task on a large scale to participants with ASD and matched neurotypical controls.Approach: We will use the mobile application developed in SA1 to disseminate the PSLM on a large scale in an at-home setting. We will recruit a set of 180 participants with ASD (30 for each age group: 20 males and 10 females) from the SPARK cohort [30] and an age and gender matched set of neurotypical controls from the SARRC database. We will develop training material for conversational partners to guide each participant through the speech elicitation tasks in the mobile application to compute the PSLM. For every participant, we will also collect the Vineland-3 and SSIS remotely. We will compare the measurement models and the reliability and validity metrics of the at-home version against the in-clinic data collected in SA1.",

To Whom It May Concern: I am pleased to support the drive by Tender Light Technology to develop its innovative technology to provide wearable iron deficiency diagnostic tools. This is a critical step in the fight against iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia.  Iron deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the world. It predominantly affects women and children but anyone, in any country can suffer from the condition.  According to the Copenhagen Consensus, solving iron deficiency is the number one health and economic challenge facing the world. Despite considerable international effort, the prevalence of the condition continues to rise in almost every country around the world and the World Food Programme predicts that the pandemic will only make the situation worse. In fact, hematologists in North America are concerned that iron deficiency is under-diagnosed  again marketing wearable diagnostic tools to identify the condition could make a major contribution to people across the world.   There are two key factors that will be important in the fight against iron deficiency  just-in-time instantaneous diagnostics and culturally acceptable solutions. The prototype that Tender Light Technology offers could be an essential tool to solve the first of these challenges.  As the Founder & CEO of Lucky Iron Fish Enterprise (LIFE), a social enterprise dedicating to eliminating iron deficiency around the world using simple and accessible health innovations, I first learned about Tender Light at the 2021 Clinton Global Initiative University virtual gathering. The concept and prototype that they have developed, and the value proposition of the technology is truly remarkable. Using their proprietary, groundbreaking Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) technology it will be possible to measure critical blood values, including but not limited to hemoglobin and bilirubin through non-invasive means. Accurate immediately available data would be a revolutionary opportunity in the fight against iron deficiency.  The background scientific work on the efficacy of the technology is impressive with 27 conference papers submitted and 26 international peer reviewed papers published validating the technology.        Lucky Iron Fish Enterprise is interested in this technology because we have developed and market, the other side of this critical challenge  a culturally acceptable, easy to use method to fortify meals at home. There is clearly potential synergy of interest and commitment and in the medium-term Lucky Iron Fish Enterprise would be significantly interested in partnership once the technology is successfully commercialized.   Developing the capacity to diagnose iron deficiency in real-time will be even more critical as we build back better from the pandemic. Not only is low iron associated with the greater risk of contracting infectious disease but also recovery times. With the clear evidence that people suffer from clinical signs of long-COVID, there is an imperative to boost iron levels everywhere.  I am pleased to support the concept of this ground-breaking technology. The current market for iron replacement is in excess of five billion dollars in the North America alone and that demand will only grow as we emerge from the pandemic.

For example, when Hurricane Irma hit Miami in 2017, residents used 311 systems to report disaster-related issues, which led city officials to adapt the system by creating a new category [2]. This user-driven technology re-appropriation has been called the emancipation process [3]. Although 311 systems have not been designed to facilitate disaster- or pandemic-related communication, individuals use them as critical methods to report issues to the local governments. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of civic infrastructures that range from reduced public transportation systems and the closure of public libraries. These changing norms and the emergence of new issues create a challenge and an opportunity for local governments and publics. If managed well, they can co-produce effective civic technology that addresses pandemic-related issues, systematizes the management of quality services, and can include this effort in local governments performance metrics. The success of civic technology for both citizens and local governments lies in understanding the tension between managerial efficiency and citizen empowerment. At its core, we aim to understand how people use the system, how local governments support peoples different uses of the system, and how the different performance metrics of local governments for 311 systems function at the metropolitan area level. We have established connections with DMVs jurisdictions during our Stage 1 period through roundtables and discussion sessions. Also, we consolidated available 311 datasets as a unified database from four DMV jurisdictions. Based on these resources and connections, we will (1) survey and consolidate local governments performance metrics that assess the outcomes of 311 systems in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area (a.k.a., DMV area), (2) analyze their 311 datasets using AI technologies and statistical methods to understand the changes in peoples 311 use patterns in the six jurisdictions in the DMV area during the pandemic, (3) survey city officials to examine how each government has engaged the changing needs of their residents, and (4) build a web-based visualization tool as a playbook that demonstrates jurisdictions assessment metrics regarding 311 systems and their best practices.Intellectual Merit: Through surveying the six governments assessment metrics for their 311 systems and analyzing their 311 datasets, we will (1) understand the co-evolution process of civic technology during the pandemic (i.e., emancipation process) and theorize the socio-technical system of civic technology and residents through a community resilience lens, (2) contribute to computational methods and AI technologies that identify sub-communities of 311 users by combining diverse datasets and 311 data from the DMV area, and (3) improve visualization techniques for demonstrating the policy landscape of 311 systems that are embedded in and shape the civic service processes.Broader Impacts: This project provides an overarching assessment framework embedded in a visualization tool for different local governments in the DMV area. These tools and metrics will be able to directly impact governments service quality, system design adjustment processes, their understanding of pandemic-related issues, and citizens awareness of communication processes. Surveys and the participatory tool assessment processes will engage city officials, civic organizations, and residents in a way that increases their understanding of the regional ecologies of civic technology, policies, and their impact. This research will also educate undergraduate and graduate students about data science, socio-technical systems, and their social implications, particularly regarding marginalized communities who are less represented in the 311 systems and in the emancipation process.Keywords: 311 systems, assessment framework, technology co-production, COVID-19, visualization",
FP00029174,549,,,,,1,,,"Emerging research suggests middle-age and older adults (MA+) with ASD are vulnerable to accelerated cognitive and brain aging, compared to neurotypical (NT) adults. Innovative MRI techniques hold promise for identifying brain-based biomarkers of cognitive decline and guiding circuit-based interventions. The relatively novel diffusion-tensor imaging metric, free-water, has been applied to differentiate extracellular and intracellular abnormalities and is more sensitive than traditional structural imaging metrics as a diagnostic biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. Similarly, advanced functional imaging methods in MA+ ASD may help identify the underlying abnormalities of age-related brain changes. Cross-sectional research shows that MA+ ASD fail to engage the cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical network during the executive function n-back task and may have accelerated cortical thinning. Our group and others have used intra-MRI transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during task-based, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI to experimentally probe cognitive circuits in young adult, elderly, and clinical populations. Others have shown modeled tDCS current distributions to be the strongest metric for predicting cognition in older adults. To improve tDCS precision, our team recently developed the first intra-MRI method to map individual current distributions using Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography (MREIT). Our long-term goal is to develop MRI-based biomarkers that will inform the development of precision medicine interventions for age-related cognitive declines in MA+ ASD. The specific aims of this application are: 1) evaluate the utility of innovative MRI metrics (i.e. free-water, intra-MRI tDCS-BOLD, and MREIT) combined with traditional MRI data for predicting accelerated cognitive decline, and 2) develop predictive computational models that can delineate important inter-individual factors for cognitive and brain aging outcomes in MA+ ASD. The study design will use an ongoing, well-characterized longitudinal cohort of cognitively-able MA+ ASD and NT who receive cognitive and MRI batteries at two-year increments (ages 40-75, mean=55.2 years; M:F ratio ~2:1). We will add longitudinal intra-MRI tDCS to measure current distributions (tDCS-MREIT) and brain activation during the working memory n-back task (tDCS-BOLD). Our primary statistical analyses will use mixed models to identify cognitive change slopes and predict slopes with baseline multi-parametric covarying patterns that identify coherence between complementary MRI data sets. Our personalized computational brain activity models (via The Virtual Brain) will delineate mechanisms and important inter-individual factors for cognitive and brain aging outcomes in MA+ ASD. Accomplishing these aims will make a sustained impact by developing: 1) biomarkers for cognitive decline, 2) an understanding of in vivo electrical brain properties, and 3) computational models that can guide precision medicine in MA+ ASD and be adapted to other disorders. In line with NIMHs experimental medicine approach to clinical trials, we are laying the mechanistic groundwork to inform future tDCS efficacy studies in MA+ ASD. This is important to the mission of the NIMH because we are addressing three of the four goals: Define the Brain Mechanisms Underlying Complex Behaviors, Examine Mental Illness Trajectories Across the Lifespan, and Strive for Prevention and Cures.",
FP00029175,550,,,,,1,,,"Rural American communities have the highest reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and the least access to the vaccine, leading to the lowest COVID-19 vaccine uptake rates in the country. In these medically underserved areas, community-based pharmacies, deemed trusted alternative vaccine delivery sites, can help decrease hesitancy and increase access to care. The goal of our community-informed, multi-level intervention is to address both vaccine hesitancy and access by using two evidence-based implementation strategies: 1) a mass media campaign to reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase demand for pharmacist-administered vaccinations and 2) training rural community pharmacists to identify unvaccinated adults and adolescents and address their COVID-19 vaccine concerns. Our multi-level intervention will work with key rural community partners to refine our intervention materials. We will then conduct a Type II hybrid, cluster RCT in two states with diverse rural populations to study both intervention effectiveness and implementation. Our four-arm cluster RCT includes a 6-week non-skippable YouTube advertisement campaign. Intervention communities will receive tailored messages, delivered by a pharmacist, that directly address rural communities concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., self-efficacy to vaccinate, attitudes about vaccine safety and effectiveness, and subjective norms to vaccinate). Control group communities will receive standard information about COVID-19 vaccine (placebo message) also delivered by a community pharmacist. Simultaneously, we will engage a subsample of pharmacy professionals (n=160) in our intervention and control communities and randomize them to receive either: (a) an online communication toolkit that will include information about identifying patients who have not vaccinated against COVID-19 and discussing reasons for their vaccine hesitancy in the intervention communities paired with monthly coaching calls with a professional communication trainer; or (b) a one-page framework with communication strategies to discuss vaccine hesitancy. We will conduct three waves of survey data collection to assess the intervention impact on rural communities vaccine hesitancy and pharmacy professionals vaccine recommendation and administration behaviors. We will also collect monthly pharmacy vaccine administration data and self-report vaccine logs to assess changes in vaccination rates in intervention and control group pharmacies. We will use mixed methods to explore implementation-related factors that may explain variability in outcomes among rural community members and pharmacy professionals. This includes qualitative in-depth interviews groups of rural community members (n=60) who differed in study outcomes and pharmacy professionals (n=30) who varied in the extent to which they implemented the intervention. If effective, this work can demonstrate ways to increase COVID-19 and other adult and family member vaccination and prepare for future rapid vaccination efforts for potential outbreaks in rural regions.",

Our research team will work with rural pharmacy staff and adult community members to adapt our evidence-based implementation strategies used in the intervention. After adapting these materials, we will conduct a hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation 4-arm factorial design cluster randomized controlled trial, randomizing at the rural pharmacy level. We will randomize a total of 88 pharmacies to one of four conditions 1) Communication training plus text nudges, 2) Communication training no nudges, 3) No training but text nudges, 4) Control; no training, no nudges. The no training, no nudges control condition will be current standard practice (usual care); however, we will offer the communication training to control group pharmacies after our six-month intervention. We will collect monthly pharmacy-level vaccine administration data from all participating pharmacies to assess the impact of our implementation strategies and explore the effectiveness of the individual implementation strategy approaches and the combination of these strategies. We will use mixed methods to examine implementation-related factors that may explain variability in outcomes among patients of rural pharmacies and pharmacy staff. If effective, this work can demonstrate ways to increase COVID-19 vaccination and other adult and family member vaccination and prepare for future rapid vaccination efforts in rural regions. Results can be used in the future with pharmacists, the most accessible healthcare providers in rural regions, to increase other adult and family immunizations (e.g., flu, pneumonia, HPV). Our findings may support scalable, disseminatable strategies to improve vaccine rates nationwide and other rapid vaccination efforts for future outbreaks.",
FP00029188,552,,,,,1,,,"The number Spanish-English bilingual learners in public schools who receive special education services recently approached one million. Of these, over 740,000 were identified with a specific learning disability. Thirty-three percent of bilingual learners and 35 percent of students with disabilities drop out of high school prior to graduation. This may be due, in large part, to an inability to read and comprehend written texts.Many adolescent bilingual children with a learning disability (LD) struggle with reading comprehension in the middle grades as they encounter complex text structures and increased cognitive demands. Previous research has shown that these adolescent bilingual learners and students with disabilities struggle with a lack of appropriate reading strategies in academic settings which impedes their ability to comprehend written text. Interventions that target strategy instruction have shown to be beneficial to improving reading comprehension for each population. However, very few studies have examined the efficacy of reading comprehension interventions on bilingual learners with LD. The goal of this dissertation study is to determine whether the use of a graphic organizer is effective in improving the reading comprehension of bilingual learners with learning disabilities. Using a randomized control trial with treatment and control conditions, the efficacy of the graphic organizer will be tested on the reading comprehension of 60 Spanish-English bilingual learners with reading disabilities. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition. Reading comprehension was compared between the treatment and control groups using three one-way ANCOVAs. Results of this intervention have the potential to provide evidenced-base recommendations on how to improve reading comprehension for this vulnerable population of children with the ultimate goal of improved outcomes in reading, academic achievement, and graduation rates.",

FP00029226,554,,,,,1,,,"Over 75% of U.S. adults report regularly experiencing physical symptoms caused by stress, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and results in large health and economic costs. Meditation is an effective self-management strategy for reducing stress, and one feasible, scalable, and popular way to perform meditation is with mobile apps. Unfortunately, persistent adherence to behavioral health regimens with mobile apps is low, and thus many mobile health app users do not attain the corresponding health benefits. Existing behavioral intervention strategies have been largely unsuccessful at establishing persistent health behaviors, particularly for behaviors with mobile apps, thus novel intervention strategies are needed for establishing more persistent mobile meditation app habits that can help to reduce stress. Recent research has demonstrated that anchoring, or pairing, a new behavior to an existing routine over a roughly three-month period can successfully establish a persistent habit. However, many people are unable to adhere to the anchoring strategy long enough to form a habit, which is likely because existing anchoring interventions do not simultaneously address important individual barriers to anchoring plan adherence. Therefore, we propose to combine the anchoring strategy with effective behavior change interventions from the health psychology and behavioral economics literature to establish persistent meditation habits with the Calm app, the leading commercial mobile meditation app with over four million paid subscribers. This study will examine the adherence behavior of 740 new, paying Calm subscribers to a 10 minutes per day prescription of meditation with Calm for 12 months. Participants will be randomized into four study arms: 1) Participants in the Usual Calm condition (UC) will receive no additional intervention. 2) Participants will receive an effective intervention to develop an anchoring plan (AC); the common way of implementing the anchoring strategy. 3) Participants will receive AC and additionally receive personalized reminders (PRC) to adhere to their anchoring plan (AC+PRC). 4) Participants will receive AC+PRC and pragmatic in-kind rewards (RwdC) provided by Calm (e.g. Calm merchandise) tied to anchoring plan performance (AC+PRC+RwdC). Aim 1 will compare the effectiveness of these three incremental interventions delivered over the first three months of the study on meditation adherence persistence over the nine months after the interventions are withdrawn. Aim 2 will examine the mediating role of anchoring plan adherence on study group differences in adherence persistence, and Aim 3 will estimate the dynamic relationship between meditation adherence and stress during the study.",
FP00029226_Res1,555,,,,,1,,,"The prevalence of stress in U.S. is at an all-time high, and experiencing stress over time (i.e., chronic stress) is associated with both negative mental and physical health outcomes and large economic costs. Racial and ethnic minorities (REM) in the U.S. have significantly higher rates of chronic stress than non-Hispanic Whites due to systemic discrimination and trauma, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this mental health disparity. Meditation is an evidence-based, self-care, stress management solution. An accessible and effective way to perform meditation is with mobile apps, which provide an alternative method of stress reduction for REM adults who face numerous barriers to accessing conventional mental health care. Unfortunately, maintaining meditation practice is difficult for many app subscribers, and existing behavioral intervention strategies have been largely unsuccessful at maintaining treatment adherence.Habits are a key strategy used by many successful long-term adherers of either app-based or medical treatments. Unfortunately, habits are difficult for many to form on their own, as they require repeatedly performing a new behavior in response to a stable contextual cue over a lengthy habit formation period (roughly three months). Recent research shows that anchoring, or pairing, a new behavior to an existing routine can successfully establish health habits. However, many people are unable to stick with anchoring long enough to form a habit, which is likely because existing anchoring interventions do not simultaneously address important individual barriers to anchoring. Therefore, we propose to combine anchoring with effective strategies from behavioral economics to establish and maintain meditation adherence habits with the Calm app.This study will examine meditation adherence in 1,020 REM Calm subscribers who are experiencing elevated chronic stress. All participants will be given a =10 min/day prescription of meditation with Calm and will be randomized to either the : 1.) Usual Calm group that will receive no additional intervention, or 2.) Intervention group in which participants will be asked to indicate an existing routine for anchoring meditation and then receive personalized reminders of their anchor and small rewards (e.g., Calm merchandise) for using their anchor to cue meditation over three months, followed by a nine-month post-intervention period. Aim 1 will assess the interventions efficacy for reducing stress. Aim 2 will examine study group differences in meditation adherence over time, and Aim 3 will investigate anchoring adherence among the intervention group.

FP00029252,557,,,,,1,,,"Hyperlipidemia, coupled with inflammation, is integral to the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) process. Current medical therapies for ASCVD cannot correct obesity, the main cause of hyperlipidemia and chronic low-grade inflammation. Obesity leads to increased circulating levels of triglyceride-rich and cholesterol-rich lipoprotein remnant particles, recently recognized as a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis. Abundant white adipose tissue (WAT) in humans makes browning of WAT a promising means to both slim the body and treat atherosclerosis. Current strategies for browning WAT are plagued by side effects and toxicity. We have developed resveratrol (RES) encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) carrying adipose stromal stem cells (ASC)-targeting peptides (ASC-targeted RES-NPs). The NPs enhanced targeted delivery of RES to ASCs after intravenous administration, resulting in browning of subcutaneous WAT and subsequent weight and fat loss, but they still accumulated in the liver. In order to bypass the liver and other tissues, we will subcutane-ously deliver ASC-targeted RES-NPs to inguinal WAT in mice in this project.The objective of this proposal is to determine the inhibitory effects of browning WAT using ASC-targeted RES-NPs on atherosclerosis in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, an atherosclerosis mouse model with human-like lipo-protein metabolism. We hypothesize that browning WAT can inhibit atherosclerosis development by decreasing inflammation, enhancing triglyceride and remnant cholesterol clearance from the circulation, and promoting re-verse cholesterol transport. The novelty of this research is as a pioneering study on the effects of beige adipocyte formation and activation impacts on atherosclerosis, in particular, the proposed use of ASC-targeted RES-NPs to simultaneously treat both obesity and atherosclerosis. The project addresses the following two specific aims: 1) determining the effects of browning WAT on atherosclerosis in mice; and 2) determining the underlying mechanisms of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in mice.Browning WAT using local and targeted delivery approaches represents an innovative strategy for the treatment of atherosclerosis with enhanced efficacy and minimized side effects and toxicity. This project will strengthen research and development at Texas Tech University, and serve as fertile ground for research training of undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of nanomedicine and ASCVD.",

State policies can increase movement opportunities for students of all demographics and abilities at school. Movement during recess is a critical source of PA and counters time in SB, but only eight states mandate regular recess for elementary school children and recess is frequently withheld for academic or disciplinary reasons. Arizona passed the first state law in the U.S. requiring two daily recess periods in elementary schools (SB1083), presenting a critical opportunity to study the natural implementation process and impact of increased daily recess periods on childrens PA and SB. We use (1) a sequential-dependent mixed method design to assess factors influencing adoption and implementation of SB1083 over five years and (2) a longitudinal cohort design to assess the impact of increased recess periods mandated by SB1083 on objectively measured PA and SB. The project, guided by Diffusion of Innovation theory framed within an ecological model of PA policy implementation, will include the administration of an annual statewide survey (N=735 schools) to gather information on practices, policies, barriers, and facilitators associated with SB1083 adoption and implementation; semi-structured interviews with individuals at the school, district, and state levels; the longitudinal collection of individual-level objective measures of PA and SB using accelerometry among a cohort of students (N=530); and the longitudinal collection of objective measures of PA and SB at the school-level using direct observation with the SOPLAY instrument (N=22 schools). Annual data collected from the statewide survey will be integrated into a publicly available state PA Dashboard created and maintained in partnership with the Arizona Department of Education to display surveillance related to PA and recess in elementary schools. Increasing recess is a low-cost strategy with the potential for significant health impact. This project will advance our understanding of the contribution of recess on childrens PA and SB. Our focus on implementation processes can inform future efforts nationwide and advance our understanding of barriers to implementation, enhancing effectiveness of school-based PA policies.  ",

Unfortunately, critical health data is often sequestered in silos due to fragmentation within healthcare systems. Sensitive health information, like substance use disorder (SUD) treatment records, is often sequestered without acknowledgement of patient data-sharing preferences. Our previous award (R01MH108992) found:  1) a general dearth of research on SUD data privacy and confidentiality; 2) few publications on how SUD data sharing protections impact care; 3) inadequate interdisciplinary research on SUD data protections; 4) minimal inclusion of patients and advocates in SUD data privacy literature; 5) sparse quantitative and qualitative research on SUD data privacy (opinions and legal reviews are predominant); and 6) low accuracy for electronic health record sensitive data segmentation software sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The focus is to amplify patients and providers' voices on Substance use HeAlth REcord Sharing (SHARES). Research question: Elucidate SUD data sharing challenges and the feasibility of automated data segmentation. Long term goal: Propose and evaluate generalized insights and strategies for sensitive medical record sharing to improve health and health care for those with SUD.

The objective of this project is to investigate nanoencapsulated natural phytochemicals for an edible coating on fresh-cut fruits and vegetables (FCFVs), to actively protect FCFVs as part of the package function, and to effectively delivery and enhance body absorption of otherwise easily degraded nutrients with much-added nutraceutical values, thus balancing the cost-value of actively packaged FCFVs as effective nutraceutical foods for largescale market acceptance. To achieve the objectives, we propose three tasks in this project:  Task I:   Synthesis and properties of nanoencapsulations and coating films.  Task II:  Multifunctional nutraceutical coatings for FCFV preservation.   Task III: Bioavailability, bioactivities, and safety of edible coatings in research mice.This project fits into the Novel Foods and Innovative Manufacturing Technologies A1364 priority in developing risk-based approaches to ensure the quality, safety and nutrition of novel foods and food ingredients, Improve the safety, quality, shelf-life, convenience, nutrient profile or sensory attributes of novel foods and food ingredients; and Advance sciences and develop technologies to improve shelf life and minimize food waste and loss throughout the food supply chain.",
FP00029314,565,,,,,1,,,"Project Title: BacktoECEsafelywithSAGE:ReducingCOVID19transmissioninHispanicandlowincomepreschoolers Principal Investigator: Rebecca Lee, PhD, Edson College, Arizona State University Background: The first five years of human life have far reaching impact throughout the lifespan. ECE provides additional benefits for children from underserved communities, promoting equity in school readiness by advancing language, literacy, and numeracy skills and by ensuring adequate nutrition and developing physical and social abilities. However, many families have been reluctant to send children back to preschools, widening an existing educational gap. Much attention has been paid to testing in K-12, but little research has been devoted to testing in ECE sites. Many Arizona teachers (~70%) have already been vaccinated, removing the most commonly cited barrier by teachers for returning to the classroom. Nevertheless, some remain vaccine hesitant, variants continue to emerge, and the longevity of the vaccine efficacy is unknown, making routine testing still important for ECE personnel. The tripod of prevention (distancing, face coverings, ventilation) is recommended by the CDC as best practices, but there has been no systematic observation of how possible this might be in ECE. ASUs FDA approved saliva qPCR test requires users to spit into a small tube, which is then collected and transported by courier to the lab for analysis, with reliable results in 24-48 hours. If successful, this study will provide (1) a highly scalable, low-cost testing strategy and (2) a guideline-driven, efficacious out-door learning strategy for Arizona ECE. Study objectives: This study aims to get children safely back to school with a three strategy approach.  1.  Child and Family Testing. We will determine acceptability, feasibility, efficacy and scalability of testing children and families as a pre-screening strategy for re-entry to 40 CACFP-eligible ECE sites for fall 2021. Our trained bilingual ASU team (vaccinated staff and nursing students) will provide on-site testing ECE sites. We will assess acceptability and feasibility via brief parent surveys and developmentally appropriate icon ratings for children, and assess efficacy as the proportion of viable samples obtained, coaching time needed to obtain one sample, and proportion of successfully obtained samples. We will document costs of delivering the screening strategy (e.g., personnel, time, materials) to determine scalability. For participants testing positive for COVID-19, community health workers from Equality Health Services will provide follow-up care.  2.  ECE Personnel Testing. We will determine the acceptability, feasibility, efficacy and scalability of routine ECE screening of ECE personnel (teachers and aides) who have direct contact with children. We will determine the acceptability of screening by 6-8 focus groups with teachers (N=80) from the 40 ECE sites above in July. We will measure feasibility and efficacy (agree to test, proportion of viable samples obtained) of bi-weekly ECE site-based testing with school personnel from half (20) of the sites for fall 2021. We will survey teachers to determine how acceptability toward testing relates to importance for back to ECE safety changes as vaccine uptake increases and vaccine hesitancy decreases over time. We will record costs (e.g., personnel, time, materials) to determine scalability. We will determine the additive efficacy of both child testing (see #1) and ECE personnel testing on attendance and enrollment. For participants testing positive for COVID-19, community health workers from Equality Health Services will provide follow-up care. 3.  Outdoor Learning via Garden Education. We will determine the efficacy of enhanced outdoor learning opportunities for closing the gap from the lack of in person based ECE on motor development and eating in the absence of hunger in 4 and 5 year olds. We will randomize participating sites to engage in an adapted Sustainability via Active Garden Education (http://sageasu.weebly.com/curriculum.html; SAGE) garden curriculum in Spring of 2022 or wait list. Wait list sites will receive the garden and curriculum in Fall 2022. We will install or enhance existing gardens in ECE sites to promote outdoor learning opportunities linked to NAEYC guidelines, and expect children in those sites to gain more rapid improvements following the learning gap. Using established protocols we will test children on motor behavior and eating in the absence of hunger in Fall of 2021 (T1, baseline), prior to implementing SAGE, in Spring 2022, following SAGE implementation, and then a follow up in Fall of 2022 to determine ongoing effects in later cohorts. We expect children in SAGE to have better outcomes compared to wait list children.  ",

FP00029329,567,,,,,1,,,"In recent years, Down syndrome (DS), characterized as cognitive deficits, has become one of the most common intellectual disabilities (ID) across different races and societies. In the United States, the prevalence of infants born with DS has increased 30% among 10 cities from 1979 to 2003 (Shin, Besser, Kuick, Lu, Siffel, & Correa, 2009). In 2028, there were approximately 250,700 children, teens, and adults living with DS. To date, executive function performance has been suggested as an effective indicator of the early development of Alzheimers disease (AD) as well as quality of life in individuals with DS (Ball et al., 2008). Therefore, this project will fill a critical void in our understanding of the effect of acute exercise on executive function (EF) and address the knowledge gap in adults with DS compared with adults with unspecified intellectual disabilities (UNID) and typical adults. We have three specific aims which are critical to answering key questions. Ninety participants, between 18 and 35 years old, (30 participants with DS, 30 participants with intellectual disabilities (ID) without DS, and 30 healthy, chronological age-matched participants) will be recruited from two sites (i.e., Mississippi State University (MSU) and Arizona State University (ASU) at Phoenix Downtown campus). This study is a within-group design. After familiarization, participants will randomly participate in three experimental sessions (i.e., control, moderate intensity aerobic exercise, and vigorous intensity aerobic exercise sessions) that take place over 4 weeks for each participant. In Aim 1, we will explore the relations between motor performance and EF functioning will be seen in adults with DS. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that participants with DS assigned to an acute session of treadmill walking exercise would improve more in EF than in a no exercise control session. Yet, this benefit may not be seen in adults with ID without DS. In Aim 3, we will systematically determine trends and confirm the potential relationship between intensity of exercise and EF in participants with DS compared to adults with ID without DS and typical adults. As supported by our published and unpublished data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the optimized intensity of exercise that may lead to neural activation to improves EF performance that may prevent the development of AD. We plan to determine the interrelations between EF and motor performance (Aim 1) and physical activity (Aim 3); and the moderator effect of exercise intensity (Aim 2). Our long-term goal is to promote physical activity participation and eliminate health disparities among individuals with ID with and without DS. This project will provide empirical evidence to understand EF in behavioral perspectives and may substantially alter the current thinking concerning physical activity participation in special populations.",

FP00029365,571,,,,,1,,,"For all students, good reading comprehension is essential for academic and social success. In developed countries, including the U.S., reading comprehension is associated with an individuals employment and health outcomes, wealth creation, and with societal crime rates and welfare dependency (World Literacy Foundation, 2015). Reading comprehension presents a challenge in the U.S. for several reasons: (1) national assessments show that a high proportion of our adolescents have poor reading comprehension (NAEP, 2019); (2) there is a wider gap between the best and worst readers in the U.S. than other industrialized countries, a gap that widens from elementary through high school; (3) Hispanic students score below white students; and (4) males score below females. The poor reading comprehension of these students has a negative impact on their ability to succeed academically and to live healthy lives after high school. The reading demands for todays adolescents require them to navigate, understand, and synthesize information from increasingly complex, diverse texts. These advanced-level reading comprehension demands are reflected in current educational literacy standards, such as the Common Core State Standards, where adolescents are expected to demonstrate the ability to integrate and interpret and to reflect and evaluate across text types, content areas, and presentation media. The problem is that current models of reading comprehension do not reflect these complexities. Nor do they reflect the changing nature of adolescent readers in our country who increasingly are bilingual and speak English as their second language, nor the probable impact of sex* differences on reading comprehension. Our project entitled Modelling Longitudinal Reading Comprehension in Adolescence: Protective and Risk Factors brings together multidisciplinary researchers to advance our understanding of reading comprehension in adolescents and how reading comprehension changes over time. Our overarching goals are to determine the structure of reading comprehension in adolescents, to identify significant predictors of reading comprehension within and across adolescence, and to identify protective and risk factors for good and poor reading comprehension. This work presents a unique opportunity to continue our longitudinal study of students who entered preschool speaking English and those who entered preschool as Spanish-English bilinguals. These two longitudinal groups are now in 9th grade. In the proposed project we plan to assess these longitudinal samples in 11th grade, as well as recruit and assess additional longitudinal students, and also add to those samples by recruiting new cross-sectional 11th grade participants.",

Among children with ASD, students who are culturally and linguistically diverse and have high-intensity needs are the most challenging for professionals to assess, place, and intervene throughout childrens school career. This project aims to cross-train autism specialist (AS) and speech and language pathologist (SLP) professionals to collaboratively support children at the intersection of having ASD, being culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD), and with high-intensity needs (HIN) (ASD-CLD-HIN). The goal of this Interdisciplinary Multicultural Professional Autism Clinical Training (IMPACT) project is to address this need for highly qualified, cross-trained SLPs and ASs to be prepared to use evidence-based practices to support the academic, behavior, social, speech, and language development of ASD-CLD-HIN. IMPACT will use innovative, collaborative online training resources (ECHO) from professionals with diverse backgrounds and expertise in culturally responsive services to (1)  Establish a sustainable, cross-professional model of culturally responsive, interdisciplinary training; (2) Prepare AS and SLP professionals to have high expectations for students with ASD-CLD-HIN to ensure appropriate placement in the least restrictive environments with the greatest academic and social exposure; (3) Prepare AS and SLP professionals who are skilled in developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based instruction and interventions that improve outcomes for ASD-CLD-HIN; and (4)  Increase the number of ASs and SLPs who are prepared to use an interdisciplinary multicultural team-based approach to address the needs of school-aged students with ASD-CLD-HIN.  In addition to the basic components of SLP and AS training practices, IMPACT features (a) an interprofessional seminar (ECHO) series to promote interdisciplinary interactions with national researchers, clinical professionals and innovative educators in communicative disorders, special education, behavioral specialists, and occupational and physical therapy with an emphasis on culturally responsive services; (b) specialized collaborative courses that address school age ASD-CLD-HIN and their families, including bilingual  learners; (c) enhanced field experiences with collaborative interprofessional case-problem solving in settings serving some of the most underserved students with ASD-CLD-HIN from around the country; and (d) opportunities to engage in community-based, interprofessional applied projects to benefit ASD-CLD-HIN who require intensive supports (and their families).

These areas of study have become increasingly important in our era of health care delivery and are vastly under-recognized and under-appreciatedespecially against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast, the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine (MCSoM) has recognized the value in conveying this content knowledge to their medical students, formally designating these topics as mandatory curricular offerings. Unfortunately, this curriculum has not been translated into widely available educational programs offered to our medical staff and, as such, represents a vital missed opportunity in our shared understanding and education.

FP00029472,576,,,,,1,,,"Many bioactive compounds show a promise in combating obesity and its related metabolic disorders, but their low levels of aqueous solubility, stability, and bioavailability in the body make administering them in physiological doses unrealistic. This is particularly true to trans-resveratrol (R) and quercetin (Q), which demonstrated promise in preventing and/or treating obesity and its associated metabolic dysfunction in some clinical trials. However, due to their low aqueous solubility, stability and bioavailability, and extensive metabolism via gut microbial-dependent and independent pathways, the results are not always consistent. To overcome these issues, we will encapsulate R and Q (RQ) into biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) in this project.

FP00029474,577,,,,,1,,,"ABOR White Paper  DRAFT v6 Arizona Universities Collaborate on CoV-2 Variant Detection, Monitoring, and Impact. There is a great need for monitoring and assessing SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern.   An Executive Summary. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the wellbeing of our state and just as the vaccines to end it have arrived, we face a new challenge: SARS CoV-2 variants that transmit at higher rates, have higher mortality rates, and evade immunity. The Arizona Covid Genomics Union is a collaboration among the states three universities that has been tracking variants since early in 2020 and can rapidly respond to this challenge. NAU, ASU, and UA are proposing to study the immunology of Variants of Concern (VoC) and their role in evading the immune system, vaccination and spread among Arizonans. All three of the universities will collectively form the Arizona Collaborative Covid Consortium (AC3), jointly engaging in surveillance and immunity analysis. We will thus leverage our shared expertise/resources and data to understand the biology of the variants of concerns and provide mitigating strategies to health care professionals and public health officials.  The Challenge. As soon as the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it began to mutate and evolve to become a more efficient human pathogen. Higher transmissibility was one of the first changes recognized (Spring 2020) and this continues to be a malleable viral trait of concern. However, with increasing immunity from COVID-19 cases and vaccination, and massive worldwide viral load, the virus is evolving to evade our immune responses, and this is very concerning. Immunity is our pathway to end the pandemic. It is critically important to Arizona to have real-time monitoring of VoC in Arizona to assess the pandemic risk and formulate responses. An AZ Cooperative Response. Early in the pandemic (Feb 2020) Arizonas universities recognized the importance of tracking the virus by using whole genome sequencing and we formed a coalition to generate data, analyze the patterns, and inform AZ State health officials. The Arizona Covid Genomics Union (ACGU) is an open collaboration of universities (UA, ASU, and NAU), a nonprofit NGO (TGen), and governmental public health institutions (County and State), with established rules for data sharing and cooperation. The ACGU members have generated over 5,000 COVID-19 genome sequences since the beginning of the pandemic, with two joint publications and several more from individual members. ACGU meets regularly, shares data, and continually communicates to coordinate analyses and VoC impacts. We have engaged in public discourse to keep Arizonans educated about the continuing risk. The ACGU is a proven approach for our universities regional-centric coordinated response to a global problem.  Problem Statement. While the development of multiple effective vaccines is a major advancement in the fight against COVID-19, several Variants of Concern have emerged in communities. For example, the UK variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351) and the Brazil variant (P.1). These are of concern because of mutations in their viral genomes that affect antibody responses and binding to the host cell receptor and because they may not be detected by many currently available diagnostic tests. There has been broad reporting of post-acute long-term sequelae of viral infection that involve multiple organs and systems (so-called long ABOR White Paper  DRAFT v6 COVID).  It is not known if some viral variants may be more likely to contribute to these long-term consequences of disease. Therefore, there is a critical need to track SARS-CoV-2 variants in real-time and understand the immunological ramifications of infection by these variants in order to inform public health strategies, diagnostics and vaccine development.    The Need. Unfortunately, much of the intense monitoring was accomplished in the first half of 2020 with The Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Unions efforts lagging in the late summer and fall of 2020 as local institutional accounts were depleted and public health interests veered to other problems. Sadly, when the UK Variant of Concern (UK-VoC) was identified in early December, there had been no Arizona CoV-2 genomes sequenced since August. In short, Arizona was not monitoring CoV-2 variants and we never would have seen UK-VoC if not for the warnings from Public Health England. The exact danger and challenges of each variant is still largely unknown. As variants are identified, we need to understand: how they transmit through populations, how they will alter COVID-19 disease, how they evade immunity, and how therapeutics will be affected. A3Cs will engage in surveillance and immunity analysis, and will strive to understand the biology of the variants. The information obtained during this program will have long lasting implications in setting public health strategies towards mitigating any harmful effects of COVID-19 VoC and other future pandemics.  Arizona State University and the Biodesign Institute PIs: Drs. Efrem Lim, Joshua LaBaer, Vel Murugan, Ji Qiu  ASU is committed to a comprehensive COVID-19 management plan and public health response. One of the Universitys COVID-19 response efforts is to actively track the virus using cutting-edge Next-Generation Sequencing technology. This includes genome sequencing of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases in March 2020. Most recently, we confirmed the first B.1.1.7 cases in Arizona. ASU has sequence confirmed 13 cases of B.1.1.7 in Arizona to date, highlighting the need for more vigilance. ASU has been working closely with the other leading institutions in Arizona, including NAU and Data showing 500 subjects who tested positive (in red) for SARS-CoV-2 a second time at ABCTL. Many individuals had negative tests in between (in blue).   UofA, as part of the Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union (ACGU), to enable open data-sharing and joint analyses.   ASU has also developed multiple capabilities to analyze the immunology of infection by the various viral strains and the effects on longer lasting disease conditions.  These patients, given the name long haulers, have in theory recovered from the worst impacts of COVID-19 and have tested negative. This condition can affect anyone  old and young, otherwise healthy people and those battling other conditions. It has been seen in those who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and patients with very mild symptoms. The ASU capability includes rapid serological tests that examine responses not only to different versions of proteins in different viral variants, but also to other concurrent or historical infections. ABOR White Paper  DRAFT v6  Sustained Sequencing and Immunological Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona.   We will perform both next-generation sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and measurements of antibody profiles from positives samples tested at the ASU Biodesign Institutes CLIA-certified testing laboratory (ABCTL). Samples tested at the ABCTL come from across Arizona, including public testing sites for Arizona Department of Health Services, non-public providers and on-site collections. About 40% of participants have given their consent to be contacted and willingness to participate in research. Hence, we are uniquely poised to conduct a sustained state-wide immune surveillance, more specifically of COVID-19 long haulers. Each sample is linked to patient metadata through a HIPAA-compliant portal (Point and Click). For this work, all samples are de-identified, and data are managed responsibly in accordance with IRB/HIPAA protocols that have been fully approved. Therefore, our data has significant epidemiological value.   Variants that break through immunity and cause COVID-19 long haulers symptoms are of particular concern. We propose to prioritize our resources to sequence samples with the highest chance of yielding clinically impactful variants. Note that ASU has additional sources of funds to perform SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.  That activity is described here to demonstrate the integration of the activities.  The bulk of the ABOR TRIF funds will be used to expand the study to include the immunology of the variants.   Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) and their impacts The University of Arizona   PI: Dr. Michael Worobey, University of Arizona  The current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge of the sort the country has not faced since the influenza pandemic of 1918, which killed 675,000 people in the United States in 1918-19.  Newly emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit increased transmission ability as well as mutations that may provide some degree of escape from immune responses from prior natural infection and current vaccine formulations.  These variants of concern, such as B.1.1.7 in the UK and B.1.351 in South Africa, have swept to dominance in each country over a stunningly short period of just a few months.  Our genomic epidemiology approach has already yielded key insights including dating the emergence of B.1.1.7 in the US and accurately predicting its rapid spread here.  We have also published two papers in Science documenting the origins of pandemic in the US and Europe and, ultimately, in Wuhan, China.  In this project we seek to build on these efforts as follows:  1. Genomic sequencing of all SARS-CoV-positive samples. We have developed a novel saline gargle clinical PCR test for the virus that is being used for  Figure 1. Scales of sampling. Our sampling scheme starts at the most local level, that of individual patients.  Increasingly large tracts of the population can then be surveilled by pooling individuals and using wastewater-based genomic epidemiology. ABOR White Paper  DRAFT v6 thousands of tests per week.  We will sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes from all positive samples to detect known or newly-identified VoC.  All resulting genomes will be analyzed co-operatively within the multi-institution Arizona COVID-19 Genomics Union (ACGU). This work will be led by Dr. Michael Worobey and Dr. Ryan Sprissler.  2. Isolation and characterization of variants of concern. We will culture virus from variants of concern in our BSL-3 facilities and investigate their immune escape properties.  We have found that it is crucial to use authentic viral isolates for assays that test how well a persons immune response to prior infection or vaccination protects against variants.  We have already isolated a home grown variant at UArizona that contains a mutation at the same key amino acid as B.1.351 and P.1 (first identified in Brazil).  And it does provide considerable evasion of immunity.  The work will be led by Dr. Janko Nikolich, Dr. Deepta Bhattacharya, and Dr. Michael Worobey.  3. Monitoring variants of concern using wastewater.  We have developed some of the worlds most sophisticated and successful approaches to monitoring wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, from single dormitories to complete municipal sewersheds in Tucson, Yuma, and other sites in AZ.  This system (Figure 1) will provide a powerful means to identify and track the dynamics of variants of concern, particularly once widespread vaccination provides potent selection for immune escape variants.  This work will be led by Dr. Ian Pepper and Dr. Michael Worobey.  4. Long COVID.  Persistent disease hits a large fraction of COVID-19 patients and is a public health time-bomb.  We will draw on our extensive clinical network to compare the incidence and nature of long COVID in patients infected by variants versus wildtype SARS-CoV-2.  This work will be led by Dr. Janko Nikolich. Northern Arizona University and the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute Principal Investigator: Dr. Paul Keim, Executive Director  1. In order to understand the global and national context for Arizona variants, we will monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants in public databases. To identify emerging variants of concern we will download and analyze all new SARS-CoV-2 genomes that are uploaded each week to GISAID, along with all new Arizona genomes being generated by the ACGU. GISAID is a resource for sharing SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from around the world, and our participation in the ACGU provides us with access to genomes from AZ patients as soon as these are generated. The different variants that we identify around the globe will then be specifically targeted for surveillance here in Arizona. We will work with clinical specimen sequencing teams at TGen North, ASU, UA, and the AZ Department of Health Services to integrate new Arizona Covid genomes into these analyses. This work will be led by co-PIs: Drs. Jason Ladner, Jason Sahl, Crystal Hepp, and Greg Caporaso.  2. PMI will continue to partner with TGen North to increase our capacity to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes from clinical specimens. NAU and PMI have excess genome sequence capacity in the form of our sequencing instruments and personnel. TGen has established multiple  ABOR White Paper  DRAFT v6 relationships with clinical partners, AZ Dept. of Health Services, and local governments to analyze virus genomes. TGen North has been the largest contributor to the Arizona State genome databases, thus far. The proposed partnership between PMI is capable of increasing TGen Norths productivity to greater than 1,000 genomes per week; greatly expanding our capacity to detect and monitor variants of concern. PI  Dr. Paul Keim  3. We propose to extensively sample wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 virus and generate genomic sequences to identify and monitor Variants of Concern. PMI has been actively sampling wastewater in order to understand COVID-19 incidence rates in different cities and even different housing complexes. This allows us to identify Variants of Concern across a broad geographic area and across time. We will: 1) continue our sampling of Northern Arizona but also expand to test wastewater across the State of Arizona, 2) use tiled amplicons to generate whole genome sequences from the wastewater samples. This unbiased approach will be used selectively with the goal of identifying novel variants, 3) develop targeted amplicon sequencing assays to detect known Variants of Concern. This work will be led by co-PIs: Drs. Crystal Hepp and Jason Sahl.  4. A SARS-CoV-2 BioBank will be established for Variants of Concern to facilitate subsequent experiments with anti-COVID drugs, diagnostics, and animal models. This an opportunity to develop a biobank of CoV-2 variants for future scientific research. We will work with TGen North and the AZ Department of Health Services to identify clinical specimens with unique variant types. These will be transferred to PMI and the virus variants grown in our ABOR supported high containment laboratory and then stored for future work, including use in animal models to understand changes in transmission and virulence. Basic characterization of the VOCs will be performed to understand the baseline biological properties of each. This work will be led by co-PIs Drs. C. Todd French and Bridget Barker.  ",

As a result, machine learning solutions are routinely adopted,due to their ability to scalably and eectively process complex data, and the expectation thatwith enough data learned models will provide the desired results. However,in practice, thetasks formulated on scientic data are often ill-posed and there often exist known or unknowngaps/approximations in data. Combined, these challenges can cause data-driven models to learnunintended shortcuts instead of factors that adhere to the true physical process. Such models oftenperform well on the observed data, yet fail when confronted with the next experiment, and whenused for actual scientic discovery, the results can be erroneous at best and misleading at worst.The traditional solution to prevent unintended shortcuts in machine learning is to demand addi-tional data covering more scenarios. Not only can this be prohibitively expensive or even impossiblein scientic applications, but it has become apparent that similar problems arise in commercial AIapplications despite internet-scale datasets.Instead, our project proposes a dierent approach to systematically discourage shortcut learningthrough fundamental advances to the current practice of scientic machine learning. In particular,we will (1) develop new families of function priors for both high dimensional and structured datathat are less prone to causing errors overshoot outside the training regime and are provably betterat strong generalization; (2) build approaches to automatically learn interpretable structure fromheterogeneous data in the form of latent hierarchies and graphs that will be subsequently lever-aged to design structure-aware learning algorithms; (3) propose novel uncertainty-based calibrationstrategies to control model behavior under large distribution shifts; and (4) develop new model se-lection approaches to enhance the existing cross-validation based techniques by explicitly takingadvantage of the fact that data is typically non-i.i.d.. We will build new algorithms and theoryto rigorously analyze the impact of the proposed approaches on the models ability to generalizemeaningfully and their ecacy in solving ill-posed problems. Together, the proposed approacheswill help avoid shortcut learning in purely data-driven methods and lead to a new class of scienticML solutions that will be more data ecient, scientically grounded, more generalizable, easilytransferable and well-calibrated.In summary, this project will enable unprecedented capabilities in deep learning-drivenpipelines ranging from new network constructions and domain-aware learning capabil-ities to calibrated uncertainties and advanced validation mechanisms, thus achievinga transformative impact on data-driven scientic discovery. The results from our projectwill also have a broad impact on the scientic community and will place DOE/ASCR technologyat the forefront of scientic ML.1Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, for theU.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

FP00029487,579,,,,,1,,,"Cadmium (Cd) is increasingly recognized as a neurotoxic heavy metal, and the primary source of Cd exposure for nonsmokers in the United States is through the food supply [1]. Childhood is a critical exposure and outcome window for Cd. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) showed that the average young child exposure exceeds most of the relevant daily Cd exposure limits set by various agencies [2]. Cd has been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders in humans [1-4], and given the long half-life (up to 30 years) of Cd in the human body [3], early life Cd exposure may also contribute to delayed onset of neurotoxicity. Importantly, prior work has shown that blood Cd levels are significantly associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) mortality among older adults in the US [5]. The human apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele, as compared to the common ApoE3 allele, is the strongest known genetic risk factor for AD      [6]. A humanized mouse model was engineered so that the mouse ApoE gene was replaced with either human ApoE3 or human ApoE4, allowing in vivo investigations of the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases [7-10]. The gut-brain axis is an important regulator for neurotoxicity [11]. In humans, gut microbiomes from patients with neurodegenerative diseases are compositionally distinct from healthy controls [12]. Most current studies on Cd neurotoxicity have focused on the direct effects on the central nervous system; the role of gut microbiome in Cd neurotoxicity is not well characterized [13]. In addition, the extent to which early life Cd exposure mechanistically contributes to AD later in life is poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to determine the role of the gut-brain axis in modulating the neurotoxic effect of Cd during critical developmental windows of exposure. The objective of the proposed study is to characterize how early life Cd exposure-induced gut dysbiosis interacts with the host ApoE3 genotype to modulate Cd neurotoxicity later in life, and identify novel microbial risk factors and probiotic remediation using humanized ApoE3/4 transgenic mice and two independent human cohorts. Our Central hypothesis is: dysbiosis of the gut microbiome associated with developmental Cd exposure contributes to neurotoxicity through modulating neuroactive microbial metabolites and inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently contributes to the susceptibility to Cd neurotoxicity in genetic risk factor carriers (Fig. 1A). We will implement a Gene  Environment  Time toxico-metagenomic approach (Fig. 1B) and test our hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Determine the effect of early life Cd exposure on the gut microbiome of ApoE3 vs. ApoE4 humanized transgenic mice over a time course and test the hypothesis that Cd alters gut microbiome and neuroactive microbial metabolites that precede the onset of cognitive deficits. Building on our findings that gut dysbiosis precedes Cd neurotoxicity in young adult male wild type (WT) mice (Fig. 2-3), and that Cd-exposed male ApoE4 mice showed the earliest onset of neurotoxicity associated with the most prominent gut dysbiosis and extra-intestinal inflammation at the terminal time point (Fig. 4-6), we will characterize the changes in gut microbiome (metagenomic shotgun sequencing), neuroactive microbial metabolites (metabolomics), and neurological endpoints over a time course in vehicle and Cd-exposed male and female ApoE3 and ApoE4 mouse pups. At critical windows of neurotoxic outcomes, we will assess markers of neuro-inflammation and gut permeability, and implement a generalized linear modeling approach to identify      key microbes that contribute to changes in neuroactive metabolites, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and memory deficits in a host ApoE genotype- and sex-specific manner. Aim 2. Identify individual microbes and neuroactive microbial metabolites that mechanistically contribute to Cd neurotoxicity in ApoE3/E4 carriers and design probiotic remediation to mitigate the AD-like phenotype. In Aim 2-1, we will perform fecal microbiota      transplant (FMT) using germ free (GF) WT mice inoculated with intestinal content from vehicle- and Cd-exposed male ApoE4 mice, and determine to what extent a diseased microbiome itself mechanistically contributes to neurotoxicity. In Aim 2-2, building on our findings that the neuroprotective short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing A. muciniphila decreased and the neurotoxic secondary bile acid (2 BA)-producing B. thetaiotaomicron increased right before Cd-induced memory deficit (Fig. 3), we will investigate the effect of the two microbes (and potentially other early microbial biomarkers to be determined in Aim 1) on Cd neurotoxicity in ApoE3/4 transgenic mice. In Aim 2-3, we will determine the interaction between Cd and ApoE3/4-associated neuroactive microbial metabolites (e.g., SCFAs and 2 BAs) on neurogenesis using neural stem cells cultured in vitro. Aim 3. Leverage two independent human cohorts (the Arivale cohort and an AD cohort) to identify blood Cd- and host ApoE genotype-associated microbial biomarkers, investigate the mechanistic role of these bacteria in neurotoxicity, and inform risks in the susceptible population. We will identify and compare blood Cd-associated microbial risk factors in 1025 self-enrolled adults (aged 18-65) as part of the Arivale cohort [14] and an AD cohort, and test our hypothesis that the blood Cd distribution shifts towards the      higher end in AD patients. We will also use GF mice to test our hypothesis that specific microbes associated with high blood Cd and the ApoE4 genotype mechanistically contribute to neurotoxicity. Regarding the expected outcomes, the proposed work will demonstrate for the first time the importance of the gut-brain axis in Cd-induced neurotoxicity during critical developmental time windows, paving the way for further understanding of the interactions between microbial genes and host ApoE genotypes and how they impact susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases.",
FP00029491,580,,,,,1,,,"access and quality, are higher among Medicaid-insured individuals compared to privately insured individuals. This is worrisome given that the Medicaid program is a key safety-net program that aims to ensure healthcare access to low-income individuals in the United States. Other individual and population-level factors such as race/ethnicity, area poverty level and primary care physician or healthcare facility density have also been associated with a higher likelihood of ACSH. There is however, a gap in the literature regarding the relationship between residential segregation-a critical population-level social determinant of health and ACSH. The need to understand this relationship is more pertinent given the economic and healthcare disruptions that have disproportionately affected minority and low-income populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also necessary to identify ACSH rates before and during the pandemic as findings could guide surveillance and evaluation of interventions such as telemedicine expansion that have occurred during the pandemic. The rapid implementation of telemedicine that has occurred during the pandemic could ensure continuity of care and mitigate some of the adverse effect of the pandemic on healthcare use. However, emerging evidence has shown persistent disparities in telemedicine adoption during this pandemic. The varied patient adoption of telemedicine could widen healthcare utilization disparities and potentially increase ACSH disparities. This could be worse for low-income individuals living with chronic conditions who already have high healthcare needs. There is a gap in the science regarding the determinants of telemedicine use among Medicaid-insured individuals with previous ACSH. This study aims to fill the gap in the science using the following three aims:Aim 1, we will determine the prevalence of ACSH before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and differences by race/ethnicity, and acute and chronic ACSH. For Aim 2 we will analyze the association between residential segregation and ACSH before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. For Aim 3, we will analyze determinants of telemedicine use during the pandemic among individuals with a previous chronic ACSH. We will address these aims by using the January 2018-June 2021 Arizona State Medicaid claims data restricted to non-elderly individuals (18-64 years). The Arizona Medicaid dataset is an ideal source because it is a claims-level dataset with a six-month lag, which will increase our ability to determine both previous and recent healthcare utilization related to ACSH. Study findings will inform interventions aimed at reducing ACSH or improving telemedicine use among individuals with a previous ACSH.",
FP00029493,581,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Stuttering is a speech fluency disorder with unclear etiology that negatively impacts the communicative abilities of 1% of the general population. Stuttering also limits the individuals academic-occupational achievement and social-psychological wellbeing. Unfortunately, current stuttering treatments are associated with considerable individual variation in their clinical outcomes, susceptible to up to ~70% relapse, and in some cases, are completely ineffective. A major barrier to progress toward determining the etiology of stuttering and the development of effective stuttering treatments is the incomplete understanding of the neural processes of stuttering. There is a critical need to identify, characterize, and improve the deficient neural processes in individuals who stutter. Current theories posit that as the brain prepares speech movements, it uses its predictions to prepare the sensory systems for more efficient and accurate speech monitoring. These predictive processes and their interplay with error-detection processes are critical for fluent speech production. This projects overall objective is to elucidate the role of predictive processes in the breakdowns of speech fluency in stuttering children and adults. We will address this question by using behavioral and electrophysiological recordings in combination with brain stimulation techniques. Our central hypothesis is that stuttering is associated with deficits in the identified predictive processes, leading to temporally or spatially inaccurate predictions. Aim 1 will characterize the temporal alignment of prediction and auditory feedback by delaying auditory feedback or speech initiation. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of prior exposure to auditory errors on predictive processes during planning. Aim 3 will determine the functional contributions of the speech premotor cortex in predictive processes. Overall, the expected outcome of this mechanistic research program is a detailed understanding of the predictive processes in stuttering individuals. This projects results will have a critical positive impact because (1) they will form a robust scientific foundation for the development of neural interventions for stuttering, and (2) they will have significant implications for theories of stuttering and speech production.

Stuttering also limits the individuals academic-occupational achievement and social-psychological wellbeing. Unfortunately, existing stuttering treatments are associated with considerable individual variation in their outcomes, and in some cases, are entirely ineffective. Additionally, existing treatments require many sessions, and some are susceptible to as much as 70% relapse, leading to costly solutions with limited accessibility, especially for individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. A major barrier to developing effective stuttering treatments is our incomplete understanding of the specific neural processes underlying the behavioral aspects of stuttering.

Project abstract  The Navajo Nation, the largest Tribal Nation in the U.S., has become one of Americas starkest food deserts, a fact that comes as a bitter disappointment for a people with a rich history of farming. Lack of access to fresh food has been a major factor contributing to high rates of diabetes, the fourth leading cause of death for Native Americans. Unfortunately, it continues to worsen despite an expanding body of research that attempts to increase food and nutrition intake. This unfolding reality of the Navajo Nation suggests that there is a need for research that focuses on Indigenous wisdom and moves beyond statistical profiling toward approaches that enable communities to co-create knowledge that responds to their own concerns and ambitions.   This project proposes outcome-driven collaborative research and action to alleviate food insecurity in the Navajo Nation in Arizona. More specifically, the project seeks to strengthen local food systems through a stakeholder-led process, while simultaneously offering options for youth engagement in Shonto, Leupp, and Black Mesa communities in the Navajo Nation. By embracing the principles of Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR), and by translating research into action, we plan to develop a more holistic food system, ultimately impacting the wellbeing of individuals and communities in the Navajo Nation. Suited for diverse settings, especially in communities with few economic opportunities, the CBPR process is a cooperative alliance characterized by research, action, and education within the community that can easily be adapted and scaled to similar settings. Our work directly targets key areas of interest to FFAR through a science-driven and community-led approach to developing a scalable food system to increase food access, improve nutritional intake, and promote agriculture-led economic growth in Indigenous communities. In addition to directly benefitting the Navajo Nation, our work has the potential to be replicated in other communities throughout the country and beyond, enacting widespread transformative impact. This project, by drawing on team members extensive experience, will demonstrate how a collaborative approach to respectful and reciprocal research can revitalize local food systems in the Navajo Nation. Revitalization of the local food system is critically important for sustaining healthy living. While effectively supporting food and nutritional security, the Plan, described herein, will promote household resilience and reduce risks owing to the diversification of food production. We expect that engagement and participation of stakeholders through the application of CBPR principles will result in inclusive food systems that are productive and profitable compared to ones developed without such engagement. The Plan will be in accordance with locally driven, place-based, and culturally appropriate methodologies rooted in Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS). We strongly believe the findings from our research will enable potential pathways through which communities of the Navajo Nation can begin to proactively reconstitute their traditional food system to make it resilient and adaptive to rapidly changing local context.    Why is FFAR ideally positioned to fund this project?  This research aligns with the mission of FFAR to increase investments in agriculture research, fill knowledge gaps, and leverage diverse public-private partnerships. Our work directly targets key areas of interest to FFAR through a science-driven and community-led approach to developing a scalable food system to increase food access, improve nutritional intake, and promote agriculture-led economic growth in Indigenous communities.  Since its creation in 2014, FFAR has taken an active role in agriculture research and advancement to address innovation and partnership to boost America's agricultural economy. Arizona State University and the Navajo Nations Division of Natural Resources (DNR) will build on this legacy through a culturally responsive Plan rooted in IKS that will result in: a) an inclusive, accessible, locally appropriate food system promoting access to healthy food, b) agriculture-led economic opportunities impacting nearly 400,000 people of the Navajo Nation c) a resilient Indigenous rural community. The convergence of multiple factors - climate change, global pandemic, migration of youth, loss of economic opportunities - along with renewed public interest in IKS, ASUs innovation ecosystem, and favorable federal government policy towards Native Americans, has sparked renewed commitment to tackle the chronic problem of food and health in Indigenous communities. It has also created an opportunity to be innovative in engaging communities at the margin of society. By embracing the principles of CBPR, characterized by research, action, and education, we will build ethical research partnerships and develop a culturally responsive and replicable food system plan with the Navajo Nation. This will necessitate community partnership  throughout all phases of the project, including: planning, implementation, data collection, analysis, development, and implementation of the Plan. By valuing the community as a vital partner in collaboration and leadership throughout the research process, we are poised to advance actionable science that promotes inclusive economic growth in the Navajo Nation. Ultimately, the CBPR process will not only benefit the Navajo Nation, but has the potential to be scaled within vulnerable communities elsewhere, enacting widespread transformative impact.  Our approach aligns with FFAR's vision of building on the strengths and resources within the community. One of the communitys strengths lies in the perspectives of IKS. For too long, education has framed IKS as problems to be taken care of through erasure, assimilation, and minimization. In reality, IKS have broadened and enriched academic discourse on science, technology, and their outcomes, enabling greater understanding of the human and cultural elements of science. Therefore, rooting our project in IKS will broaden our methods of inquiry.   Goals and objectives  Over  the  past  decade,  there  has  been  increasing  recognition  that  more  comprehensive  and participatory approaches to research and interventions are needed to address complex sets of social and environmental problems associated with health and wellbeing of marginalized populations (Commission  for  the  Social  Determinants  of  Health  2008;  Commission  to  Build  a  Healthier America  2009). In  response  to  this  call,  researchers  have  embraced  CBPR,  described  as  a partnership  approach  to  research  that  equitably  involves,  for  example,  community  members, organizational representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research process and in which all partners contribute expertise and share decision making and ownership (Israel et al. 2008). The aim of CBPR is to increase knowledge and understanding of a given phenomenon and integrate the  knowledge  gained  with  interventions  and  policy  change  to  improve  quality  of  life  of community members. Guided by the principles of CBPR, a process that offers a cultural and intellectual openness to ideas and approaches that are not traditionally considered as knowledge, the overarching goal of our project is to conceptualize a pathway, rooted in IKS, for alleviating chronic problems of food access, improving nutritional outcomes, and fostering agriculture-led economic growth in the Nation. By embracing the principles of CBPR, we respond to calls for building ethical research partnerships with the Navajo Nation. Following Louis & Grossman (2009), we argue that building a  sustained  partnership  and  working  with  Indigenous  communities  present  an  opportunity  for researchers to move beyond past injustices. In  light  of  the  emerging  reality  of  the  Navajo  Nation,  including  energy  transition, pandemic, and growing social inequality, our objectives are to: a) co-develop a food system plan that promotes food sovereignty at the household level while simultaneously improving human, organizational,  and  systems  performance;  b)  revitalize,  through  knowledge  co-production,  the local food system to ensure healthy living and create thriving socio-economic opportunities for farmers  in  the  Nation;  c)  advance  an  understanding  of  the  challenges  and  opportunities  to developing thriving local food systems through enhanced dialogue and  educating stakeholders through shared vision and active engagement; d) outline essential elements of the CBPR process and make it available to other communities; e) build capacity at the local level to lead current and future initiatives; and f) increase youth empowerment for making their own decisions.  Achieving these objectives will require creating: a) intellectual space to share, exchange, and engage in the production of knowledge, strategies, and solutions; b) dialogues and engagement an for on  multiple  levels  and  with  stakeholders;  c)  models  of  engagement  at  the  level  of  ontology, epistemology, and morality that are requisites for deep partnerships between and among producers and users of knowledge; d) working towards a balance between research and action so that all partners  benefit;  and  e)  learning  about  and  respecting  communities  history  and  wide-ranging factors that may have impacted traditional food systems in the Nation. This requires establishing a  long-term  commitment  and  determining  the  range  of  practical  possibilities  for  partnership between community members and researchers, for which the process-based approach of CBPR is most appropriate.   Project description and approach  Interest in multidirectional knowledge exchange involving active collaboration and partnership between researchers and community members at all stages of the research process is rising (Israel et al., 2010). The process-based approach, an important thrust of CBPR, provides an unparalleled opportunity engaging community  members,  academic researchers, and other stakeholders in  all  phases  of the  research process,  increasing  the  likelihood of interventions success. Arizona State Universitys Just  Energy  Transition  Center, School of Sustainability, School for the Future of Innovation in Society, Kyl Center for Water Policy, ASU of LightWorks, Computing, and Decision Systems Engineering, and College  of  Health  Solutions propose outcome-driven collaborative  research  project  to and understand opportunities a thriving local food system in the Nation. Guided by the principles of CBPR (see Box 1), widely used in participatory research, this project will develop a plan (pathway) for strengthening local food systems, alleviating chronic problems of food access, improving nutritional intake, and promoting sustainable agriculture-led economic growth. The project seeks to strengthen inclusive  food  systems  through  a  stakeholder-led  mechanism,  while  simultaneously  offering options for youth engagement in three communities in the Navajo Nation - Shonto, Leupp and Black Mesa (see Figure 1). Box 1: Principles of CBPR a) Recognize,  distinguish,  and  respect  the  community  as  a unique and vital partner in the research process; b) listen to, learn from, and identify what each collaborator brings to the process; c) build on strengths and find solutions to challenges collectively; d) enable fairness and equality in all phases of the research process; e) ensure  all  collaborators  learn,  grow,  and  share  throughout  the process; f) work towards a balance between research and action so that all partners benefit from the process; g) collectively learn about and respect the communitys history and wide-ranging factors that impact their health and well-being; h) build flexibility, feedback, and compromise into the process; i) share findings and lessons learned with  all  collaborators  in  meaningful  ways  to  develop  collective action; j) commit to the problem, process, and evolving relationships; and  k)  anticipate  and  resolve  disagreements  through  a  process  of positive feedback. Source: Israel et al. 2006 J Urban Health; 83(6):10221040   School Informatics, challenges for Process-based  and  participatory  approaches  to  planning  and  community  development, while  time  consuming  and  costly,  are  geared  towards:  empowering  community  members; enhancing their voice and self-determination towards achieving effective and culturally responsive solutions  to  community  challenges;  raising  their  standard  of  living;  promoting  social  welfare, justice, and community cohesion; and developing their material and human resources to the fullest extent (Sharp 2012). CBPR is grounded in the development of relationships of mutual respect and trust that enable power sharing between researchers and subjects in all phases of the research fostering an process (Baum et al., 2006). With its attention to action as an integral part of the research process, CBPR further encourages researchers to expand beyond science to become a data-driven approach to improve the well-being of a community (Leung et al. 2004).  The Navajo Nation has become one of Americas starkest food deserts. Lack of access to fresh  food  has  been  a  major  factor  contributing  to  high  rates  of  diabetes  and  other  associated ailments. This suggests that there is a need for research that focuses on approaches that enable communities to co-create knowledge responding to their own concerns and ambitions. We propose process-led CBPR to develop inclusive food systems that are productive and profitable compared to ones developed without the engagement of community members, academic researchers, and others in all phases of the research process. Our hypothesis is: using a collaborative approach to identify and implement locally led initiatives in the Nation will result in improved food systems  that  alleviate  chronic  food  insecurity  and  improve  nutritional  intake  while promoting agriculture-led economic growth.  Based on the learning from past research on CBPR, we argue that researchers must do more than  provide  descriptions  of  characteristics  of  their  research  subject.  A  study  with  Canadas Indigenous communities by Tobias et al. (2013) reveals that CBPR approaches can be used to preserve and transfer Indigenous knowledge to new generations. They also argue that protecting indigenous knowledge is integral to guiding the development of strategies toward improving and maintaining community wellbeing. A study by Louis & Grossman (2009), demonstrates practical strategies  that  each  of  the  participating  communities  can  apply  toward  mitigating  their environmental  concerns.  Documenting  and  communicating  Indigenous  knowledge  to  younger generations also serves as a form of political support for communities as they continue in their efforts toward self-determination and land claims processes. To have a broader and more sustained effect on the Navajos Nation's food system, following Nelson et al. (2008), we argue that the models  for  influencing  policy  need  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  farmers  and  their  supporting institutions so that they can engage in the policy change process. CBPR promotes mutual transfer of expertise and shared decision making between researchers and community members (Israel et al. 2006). To this end, a collaborative approach to generating knowledge has the potential to bring about  sustained  policy  change  in  the  Navajo  Nation.  This  project,  therefore,  also  serves  as  a blueprint for future researchers and communities.   The Navajo Nation: The  Nation  has  become  one  of  Americas  starkest  food  deserts,  a  fact  that  comes  as  a  bitter disappointment  for  a  people  with  a  proud  Indigenous  farming  history.  The  Nation,  which  is roughly the same size as West Virginia, has only 13 grocery stores, making access to fresh food very challenging. Many residents have to drive an hour or more to get to their closest grocery store. Lack of access to fresh food has been a major factor contributing to high rates of diabetes, the fourth leading cause of death for Native Americans. One in three people in the Nation are diabetic or prediabetic. Rooted in local and IKS, farming was once an essential part of the Nations culture, but due in part to assimilation, forced relocation, and reliance on federal food programs, it has waned. in reduced live  below line,  more Over  the  past  year,  lessons  from  the  pandemic  have  highlighted  the  fragility  of  socio-economic systems of most societies. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, at its peak in May, the Navajo nation had 2,304 cases of COVID-19 compared to 1,806 cases per 100,000 people in New York State. According to the recent Census, 38 percent of people in the Navajo the Nation poverty than double  the  US  poverty  rate of 15.1%. Over 90 percent of students the  Navajo Nation  are  eligible  for  the free  or lunch program,  compared  to  the state  average  of  55  percent in  the  State  of  Arizona. Simultaneously,  access  to food,  water,  energy  and have health care all significant demonstrated inequalities between and indigenous non-indigenous communities. Shortly after the quarantine, while  working  with  local community groups, the  Navajo President  of Nation, President  Nez identified the lack of access to fresh nutritious foods.  Figure 1: Map of the Navajo Nation - covering Arizona, Utah, Colorado Revitalization of the local food system is critically important for sustaining healthy living. Following conversations with the Nations leadership and background research into existing food systems, we propose co-producing knowledge capital to create a food system that is culturally and  environmentally  sound  and  economically  viable  for  the  Nation.  While  effectively supporting food and nutritional security, the Plan will promote household resilience and reduce risks  owing  to  the  diversification  of  food  production  while  simultaneously  improving  human, organizational, and systems performance. Through a locally led, culturally responsive approach to generating knowledge in the Navajo Nation, we will develop a resilient, sustainable, scalable food system Plan that: a) promotes food sovereignty and healthy living by building resilience to food shocks for tribal members; b) enhances agriculture-led economic opportunities for people of the Nation; c) builds capacity at the local level to lead current and future initiatives; and d) engages youth, future farmers of the Nation, to contribute and benefit from this project.  As  opposed  to  classic  top-down  approach,  the  Plan  will  be  in  accordance  with  locally driven, place-based, and culturally appropriate methodologies, and follow the principles of CBPR. One important aspect of the Plan is shared learning and evaluation of the planning process itself and its replicability. The process will be adaptively guided by stakeholder engagement and focus group discussions to ensure the final Plans continuing relevance and value, including replicability in other contexts. The principles of CBPR will make the process truly adaptive as it can readily and New Mexico incorporate new information about the systems as it becomes available and adjust to new goals driven by decision making and management needs (Voinov and Bousquet 2010). Application of CBPR on the Nation will generate a nimble, replicable, and scalable model for success on the Nation  and  other  Indigenous  communities  throughout  the  United  States,  potentially  impacting numerous individuals and communities for generations to come.   Research design and methodological approach: The promise that more science will lead to more societal benefits may increasingly be at odds with the experience of individuals who find their lives changing in ways they cannot control and in directions that they did not imagine (Sarewitz 1997). For example, continued innovation in science and technologies fuels economic growth and creates many conveniences, but it also undermines community-based  institutions  and  relationships  that  may  be  crucial  to  the  welfare  of  the communities. It has become increasingly clear that collaborative action research, especially with members of the community, is essential to the development of socially beneficial sciences. As noted by Leung et al. (2004) CBPR goes beyond science that measures associations to become a  data-driven  approach  to  improve  the  wellbeing  of  a  community.  Based  on  a  review  of successful research partnerships, Israel et al. (1998) has identified a set of CBPR principles that are now widely accepted (see Box 1). For the purpose of our research, these principles will serve as guides for development of the CBPR project. We believe that integration of these principles into development of a CPBR project will benefit the Navajo Nations food system research by facilitating the translation of research into action, ultimately impacting the health of individuals and communities.  As illustrated in Figure 2, in addition to the CBPR principles, there are seven broad core components  in  pursuing  CBPR  research.  While  there  is  some  sequential  order  to  conducting CBPR, the process is nonlinear and these components may be considered as phases of the research (Israel et al. 2012). It is important to note that some elements of the component continue throughout an  entire  CBPR  effort.  For example,  maintaining  and partnership sustaining throughout occurs the the different of phases process  (indicated  by the large circle in the center of the figure).  As  partners  work  on an  ongoing  basis  to  build trust, capacity, resolve  conflicts,  generate and  share  knowledge  and skills,  they  have  to  maintain healthy partnership. Similarly,  evaluation  of  the partnerships effectiveness needs to start at the beginning and  continue  throughout  a CBPR project.   Figure 2: Core component for pursuing CBPR, Adapted from Israel et al. 2012 develop a The  first  core  component  of  the  proposed  project  is  forming  a  CBPR  partnership.  It involves  such  processes  as  identifying  potential  partners,  building  trust  and  relationships, establishing operating norms to ensure equity and power sharing, and creating an infrastructure for carrying out the research process (Vasquez et al. 2007).  The second component entails assessing community strengths and dynamics. This involves asking questions, such as: What are the strengths and resources in the community? What are key cultural and historical dimensions? Which are the influential organizations? How is the power dynamic operating in the community? Who needs to be involved to ensure community voice?  The third component is identifying priority food systems concerns and research questions. Key questions here include: What are the major food issues causing detrimental health impacts on the  community  that  the  alliance  wants  to  address?  How  are  these  problems  identified  and prioritized? What are the factors (for example, social, economic) contributing to food deserts in the Navajo Nation? What are the key research questions that this study is intended to answer in order to alleviate food insecurity?  The fourth component involves designing and conducting research. The semi-structured and deliberative nature of CBPR allows creative thinking about designing research that leads to culturally sensitive pathways to future food systems. The process also allows for consideration of constraints, drivers of change, and the structures and institutions through which these are shaped (Tschakert and Dietrich 2010).  The fifth component is feedback and interpreting the findings within the partnership. This involves sharing the findings from the research, such as the results of the analysis of the survey and engaging all partners in making sense of what was found.  The sixth component of pursuing CBPR research for this project is developing the Plan based on the research findings. In planning project activities, one must determine the sequence of activities, timeframe, allocation of responsibilities, and equipment and service needs (Reed 2004). Some  of  the  questions  here  include:  What  are  the  kind  of  activities  that  all  members  of  the community embrace? What is the role of community partners in implementing these activities? How to secure resources, financial and otherwise, to translate some of the activities from the plan into more broadscale interventions and policy change?  The final core component is maintaining, sustaining, and evaluating the partnership.  It is an ongoing process that is at the center of all these phases and occurring throughout. Relevant questions  to  address  include:  How  well  is  the  partnership  working?  How  can  the  partnership process  be  improved?  What  aspects  of  the  partnership  need  to  be  considered  regarding sustainability, for example, enhanced relationships and  capacity? Evaluation is not a one-time activity at the end of a project, but a continuous activity that spans all stages (Voinov and Bousquet 2010).  The core components discussed above illustrate that CBPR is an approach to research and not a specific method. There is no one methodological approach to CBPR and there are no single data collection rules that are applicable to all CBPR efforts (Israel et al. 1212). It is a process-based approach to research guided by a set of principles and implemented in multiple stages. What is novel  here  is  its  emphasis  on  striving  for  equal  participation  and  ownership,  reciprocity,  co-learning, and policy advocacy. Most importantly, embedded in this process is the capacity building of the partners. What distinguishes CBPR from other approaches to research is the integral link between the researcher and the subjects whereby cultural sensitivity is combined with process and procedures to establish and maintain the integrity, trust, reciprocity, and mutual respect (Tobias et al. 2013). An important part of CBPR research is its attention to issues of trust, power, cultural diversity, justice and equity (Tobias et al. 2013).  Methodologically, CBPR draws from a wide range of research designs and methods (Israel et al. 2012). For our project we will draw from a full range of research designs involving survey questionnaires, in-depth interviews, focus groups, ethnography, and mapping. In all cases we will follow  participatory  principles  to  engage  all  CBPR  partners.  To  this  end,  our  research  design involves  mixed  methods  approaches.  Regardless  of  the  research  design  and  methods  used,  a number of important questions need to be addressed in order to have a strong collaboration and partnership. Such questions include: How is the community defined? Who will be involved, and who  decides  on  that  involvement?  Are  community  members  involved  as  individuals  or representatives  of  organizations?  To  what  extent  do  the  members  in  question  represent  the community in terms of class, gender, age and language(s) spoken? How will partners be involved? How will trust and open communication be established and maintained? How will issues of power and conflict be addressed? How will equitable participation be achieved across all partners?  We consider this to be  a novelty of our  research and critically important to ensure  continuity  and sustainability of the projects.  Indigenous Knowledge Systems: Basis for Food System Planning in the Navajo Nation: The vision for this study is inspired and guided by IKS, refers to as knowledge of local Indigenous people concerning the everyday realities of living in a nourishing relationship with their traditional lands  and  ecosystems  (Ermine  et  al.  2005).  Characterized  as  pluralistic,  narrative-based, experiential,  ecological,  relational,  and  holistic  (Archibald  2008),  the  IKS  includes  cultural traditions,  values,  and  belief  systems  that  have  both  sustained  and  allowed  Indigenous communities to sustain in some of the harshest environments over many generations (Cajete 2000). Transmission  of  such  knowledge  typically  occurs  on  the land  between  community  Elders  and youth (Tobias et al. 2013). If the youths are disconnected from their land and ancestor it  precludes them from acquiring the knowledge and disengage them further from their social and cultural activities. In her seminal book on Indigenous research, Linda Tuhiwai Smith (1999) begins by stating that research itself is often perceived negatively within many Indigenous communities. She further expands upon this claim by explaining how scholars have too often treated Indigenous peoples as natural objects of research. This dehumanization of Indigenous populations is characterized by a total  lack  of  accountability  and  reciprocity,  and  typically  involves  parachute  research,  i.e., parachuting in, grabbing data, and immediately leaving (Menzies 2004). While such studies may often provide critical baseline data, they often do little to improve the wellbeing of Indigenous communities. Existing food system narrative, for example, is largely void of Indigenous voice and paints  a  picture  of  Indigenous  communities  as  being  unable  to  self-govern,  perpetuating  a perception of the need for continuous care (ONeil et al., 1998; Meadows, 2003). Simultaneously, such research draws attention away from contextually specific causes of food insecurity. Castleden, Garvin, & Huu-ay-aht First Nation (2008) argue that researchers who apply CBPR with Indigenous communities should pursue a set of common objectives: to equalize power differences within the research process; to build trust between the researchers and the community; and to foster a sense of ownership tied to generating momentum toward social change. These objectives are based on the CBPR principles (Box 1) that true partnership entails co-learning and that findings should benefit all partners (Israel et al., 2005). Engaging through CBPR principles requires  the  inclusion  of,  and  engaged  participation  by,  community  members  throughout  the research process (Fisher & Ball, 2003). Given the strong links between the food, health, and land of Indigenous communities, the disconnect between land and everyday life can be viewed as threatening community wellbeing and health  (Battiste  2000).  There  exists  a  need  for  deeper  understanding  of  the  cultural,  political, ec",
FP00029497,584,,,,,1,,,"Investigation of Associations Between Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Alterations in Gut Microbiome in the First Cycle of Chemotherapy: Potential for Precision Therapeutics  PI: Komal Singh, PhD, MS, RN [Arizona State University, AZ and Mayo Clinic, AZ] Co-Is: Nicholas Chia, PhD [Mayo Clinic, MN]; Brenda Ernst, MD [Mayo Clinic, AZ]; Cindy Tofthagen, PhD, ARNP, AOCNP, FAANP, FAAN [Mayo Clinic, FL]; Qiyun Zhu, PhD, MS [Arizona State University, AZ]; Haiwei Gu, PhD [Arizona State University, AZ]  Statistician: Keenan Pituch, PhD, MS [Arizona State University, AZ] This project is a full study for Symptom Science in Precision Health and Biosignatures. Abstract Purpose/Specific Aims: Unrelieved nausea after chemotherapy can lead to poor nutritional status and decrements in quality of life.  Our groundbreaking preliminary findings provide evidence for associations between disruptions in the gut microbiome functions and chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN). To better understand underlying biological mechanisms for CIN and to discover potential strategies to mitigate or prevent CIN, this study will investigate associations between CIN and alterations in the gut microbiome metatrancriptomics (i.e., gene expression) and gut metabolite levels, before and after the first cycle of moderate to highly emetogenic chemotherapy. In addition, this study will evaluate associations between co-occurring neuropsychological symptoms and CIN.  In a sample of chemotherapy-nave patients with breast cancer (n=50) whose stool and blood samples will be analyzed 4 days prior to chemotherapy (T1) and on days 4 (T2) and 16 (T3) post-chemotherapy, the specific aims of this study are to:  1)  Evaluate changes in metatranscriptomics and metabolomics from: T1 to T2; T1 to T3; and T2 to T3 in patients who do and do not report CIN occurrence.  2)  Estimate the effect size of metatranscriptomics and metabolomics associated with CIN occurrence at T2 and at T3. 3)  Evaluate associations between co-occurring neuropsychological symptoms and CIN at T2 and T3.   Significance: Despite antiemetic treatments, 30% to 60% of oncology patients experience CIN. Unrelieved nausea in the first cycle of chemotherapy is a risk factor for future episodes. Currently known risk factors do not explain all the inter-individual variability in CIN occurrence. Our recent studies show that a number of neuropsychological symptoms are associated with CIN. Common underlying mechanisms may explain co-occurring symptoms.   Our recent gene expression study was the first to describe associations between alterations in the microbiome-gut-brain-axis and CIN occurrence. Specifically, mucosal inflammation and disruption of the gut microbiome were the major mechanisms associated with CIN.  Theoretical Framework: Theory of Symptom Management (TSM) will guide the study in the context of: Person Domain, Health and Illness Domain and Environment Domain.   Main Research Variables: Nausea, Depression, Anxiety, Diet, Gut-microbiome, Gut-metabolites.  Design: Descriptive cohort study design.  Setting: Mayo Clinic, Arizona: Institutional Review Board will review and approve the study.   1  Sample: Fifty patients will be enrolled to accrue forty evaluable patients blood, stool and questionnaire data.  Methods: Patients will provide phenotype assessments, blood, and stool samples, before and after chemotherapy. For Aim 1, ribonucleic acid (RNA) will be extracted and sequenced from stool samples. Computational analysis will be performed for de novo assembly, and functional annotations of the microbiome. Finally, differential expression and pathway analysis will provide insights into changes in microbiome functions over time. Metabolites from blood will be analyzed on liquid chromatography to detect changes in metabolite concentrations over time. For Aim 2, logistic regression modeling approach will estimate the effect size of metatranscriptomics and metabolomics associated with CIN occurrence at T2 and T3. For Aim 3, a second logistics modeling analyses that includes co-occurring neuropsychological symptoms at T2 and T3 separately, will evaluate the associations of these symptoms with CIN occurrence. Implications for Practice: This study will identify: (1) biological mechanisms related to inter-individual differences in CIN occurrence that will lay the foundation for (2) designing targeted interventions to improve chemotherapy treatment outcomes.

FP00029522,586,,,,,1,,,"Cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases with diverse clinical characteristics and molecular profiles. Decades of research have discovered many germline genetic risk variants that confer hereditary cancer susceptibilities, and somatic driver mutations that promote malignant transformations of body cells. Because somatic mutations arise in the background of an individuals germline genome, pre-existing germline variants may influence which synergistic somatic mutations are needed to drive tumorigenesis. Thus, these two groups of variants and their interactions together affect a tumors clinical phenotype, such as histological subtype, metastasis sites, and response to treatments. However, as current studies mostly examine germline and somatic variants independently, our knowledge of germline-somatic interplays (GxS) is very limited.To address this knowledge gap and to facilitate precision oncology, we propose a novel computational framework, Variants Interacting in Germline and Soma (VIGAS) that jointly assess the functional impact of these two groups of variants. Using multiple myeloma (MM) as the disease platform, we will develop a suite of bioinformatics methods to discover and characterize GxS via integrative analysis of multi-omics data. We will examine various types of genetic variants in coding and noncoding regions. Unlike existing methods that use simple metrics based on co-occurrences of germline and somatic variants, the VIGAS methods aim to discover GxS with biological significance.We will pursue four specific aims. Aim 1: we will develop a VIGAS-e method to discover GxS based on evolutionary selection, in which germline variants modify selective advantages of somatically mutated genes. Aim 2: we will develop a VIGAS-t method to discover GxS based on transcriptional regulation, in which somatic mutations aggravate pre-existing transcriptional aberrations caused by germline variants. Aim 3: we will combine VIGAS-e and VIGAS-t results to identify GxS that converge on common genes and pathways and are associated with clinicopathological features of MM. We will evaluate the performance of VIGAS comprehensively via simulations, replication in independent MM data sets, and enrichment of known cancer drivers. For top GxS, we will perform experimental validations. Aim 4: we will apply VIGAS to various cancer types. Comparisons across cancer types will reveal associations of GxS with tissue specificity, as well as the risk of developing cancers in different organs. We will implement VIGAS as open-source cross-platform tools, release comprehensive annotations of GxS in an online database, and organize a user community on GitHub.The VIGAS methods and the characterized GxS will greatly improve our understanding of the complex genotype-phenotype relationships in tumorigenesis. Our study will reveal cancer heterogeneities rooted in germline genomes and build the foundation for precision cancer management tailored to individual patients. This will transform cancer management from reactionary approaches toward more proactive approaches.",
FP00029525,587,,,,,1,,,"SPECIFIC AIMSDevelopmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) states that there is a sensitive developmental time window for environmental toxicant exposure, which leads to delayed onset of complex diseases in adulthood1. The formerly used flame-retardant polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of highly persistent and bio-accumulative toxicants that have raised great safety concerns in North America2. In U.S. population, the daily PBDE dietary intake of newborns is almost exclusively through human milk, followed by fatty food later in life. Studies of blood and breast milk showed that U.S. women have the highest levels of PBDEs in the world3, 4, 5. BDE-99 is one of the most abundant PBDE congeners, and it was detected in breast milk from United States at roughly one order of magnitude higher than in Europe and Asia. In adult rodents, chronic exposure to diet-related PBDE congers can promote hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and liver cancer6, 7, 8, 9, 10. However, little is known about how early life PBDE exposure contributes to liver cancer in adulthood.We recently showed that early life BDE-99 exposure up-regulated genes involved in carcinogenesis in livers of young adult male pups (Fig. 1). This was accompanied with a persistent intestinal increase in the male-predominant Akkermansia muciniphila (16S rDNA sequencing) and its epigenetic-modifying metabolites succinate and acetate in liver (GC-MS), as well as a hepatic increase in microbial constituents and pro-inflammatory gene expression (Fig. 2). Building on our preliminary findings, we will use single cell RNA-Seq (sc-RNA-Seq), metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MGS), epigenetic profiling, metabolic network construction and isotope tracing, to strategically investigate how early life BDE -99 exposure and the gut-liver axis interact to produce adult onset of liver cancer. Our central hypothesis (Diagram 1) is: early life BDE-99 exposure reprograms the gut microbiome to send epigenetic and pro-inflammatory signals to liver, triggering a shift in the developmental trajectory of multiple liver cell types towards a cancer-prone signature. We will test this hypothesis in the following 3 Specific Aims:Aim 1. Characterize early life PBDE-mediated cell type-specific transcriptomic changes at single cell resolution in liver associated with persistent gut dysbiosis over a time course. We will orally expose C57BL/6 male and female conventional (CV) mouse pups to BDE-99 at postnatal day (PND) 2-4, and monitor the hepatic cell-type specific transcriptomic signatures (sc-RNA-Seq), gut microbiome (MGS), and microbial metabolites including succinate (GC-MS). We will associate these omics data with important metabolic parameters and phenotypic changes (e.g. histopathology) over a time course till advanced adulthood.Aim 2. Determine the necessity of gut microbiome in modulating early life PBDE-mediated liver cancer in adulthood. In Aim 2-1 we will perform fecal microbiome transport (FMT) using BDE-99 exposed donors in a sex-specific manner at their most critical window of toxic outcome to age-matched germ free (GF) recipients, and determine how the diseased gut microbiome itself contributes to liver toxicity at single cell resolution in adulthood. In Aim 2-2, we will expose CV pups that were developmentally exposed to BDE-99 to broad-spectrum, poorly absorbed antibiotics at different time frames, in order to capture the effective therapeutic window to mitigate the delayed onset of liver cancer.Aim 3. Investigate the hepatic bioavailability of gut-derived succinate and novel epigenetic signatures that contribute to early life PBDE-exposure mediated delayed onset of liver cancer. In order to determine the hepatic bioavailability of gut-derived microbial metabolites (such as succinate and SCFAs), in we will perform isotope-tracing using livers of BDE-99 exposed pups fed with a 13C-labeled starch diet.Regarding the expected outcomes, we will demonstrate for the first time that gut microbiome is also an important molecular target for DoHAD. We will unveil persistent gut dysbiosis-mediated molecular switch in the developmental trajectory in liver at single cell resolution, and identify critical therapeutic windows to mitigate the PBDE hepato-toxicity beyond the childhood.

FP00029669,589,,,,,1,,,"7. Project Summary/Abstract Dyslexia affects reading, writing, and spelling development in 5%-9% of children. Despite treatment, difficulties with various aspects of written language can persist throughout adulthood. Because literacy skills are not taught until children enter school, dyslexia cannot be diagnosed in infants and preschoolers, precluding proactive intervention. The greatest challenge in understanding dyslexia is that causes and expressions are complex, involving several levels of analysis, each with substantial knowledge gaps: There are multiple genetic and environmental causes, but these are not fully understood individually or in their interactions. Several deficits in basic information processes influence dyslexia, e.g., working memory, sequential processing, attention, and processing speed, but to what extent they co-occur and are linked to specific genetic and/or environmental triggers is unclear. Comorbidity and interactive effects with health impairments such as immune deficiency, gastrointestinal problems, and motor dysfunction are not well understood. Dyslexia is frequently comorbid with developmental language disorder (DLD), but how risk factors and basic processing deficits drive this comorbidity is unclear. These knowledge gaps result mainly from the fact that previous studies were done in many different samples, focusing only on a subset of the levels of analysis. The goal of this project is to create the first integrated framework in a single study, taking into account genetic and environmental risks and associated health impairments to characterize distinct dyslexia profiles and predictors by leveraging novel multilevel artificial intelligence (AI) analysis methods. This interdisciplinary investigation will incorporate data from an ongoing longitudinal study of working memory (5R01DC010784-08) in children with dyslexia, children with dyslexia and comorbid DLD, and children with typical development. That study provides a broad set of behavioral and educational data. Toward a more representative purview, children with dyslexia and comorbid attention deficit disorder (ADHD) will be added, with 80 5th graders in each group. To assess genetic, environmental, and health variables, DNA samples and family questionnaires will be collected. Aims are to: 1. Identify genetic disruptions; 2. Quantify physical and social environmental risks; 3. Quantify health impairments; and 4. Integrate causal factors, expressions of dyslexia, and health impairments into a single framework using AI and conventional methods. Results will show biological and environmental influences and their interactions on distinct expression patterns of dyslexia. The study is designed to confirm or disconfirm previously posited hypotheses and discover evidence for novel associations. Findings will inform future development of proactive and personalized strategies to improve outcomes in individuals with dyslexia. ",
FP00029695,590,,,,,1,,,"A seroepidemiological study on the association of Helicobacter pylori and coinfections in lung cancer  Abstract   There is growing evidence showing the potential role of microbial infection in lung cancer (LC) development. Our proposed study will focus on Helicobacter pylori (HP), which is one of most studied bacteria because it causes gastric cancer and many other diseases. Epidemiological studies suggest an association between LC with HP. Gastrin and inflammatory cytokines induced by HP can promote lung cell proliferation and chronic airway inflammation. However, reports on the association between HP and LC have been inconsistent. Previous studies suffered from small sample size, inappropriate controls, and immunoassays that relied upon crude lysates or a few sentinel antigens. In the case of gastric cancer, co-infection with other bacteria or viruses with HP is important; however, the role of co-infections with HP has not been studied in LC.   Microbial infection elicits anti-microbial antibodies, which connote not only exposure but also reflect the host physiological state and a functional immunological interaction with the host. Different microorganisms may play different roles in different stages of cancer development. It is believed that some microorganisms like HP initiate cancer but become absent from tumor tissue by metagenomics analysis by the time of cancer diagnosis. An anti-microbial antibody study provides an effective logbook of a persons infection history that complements existing sequencing studies. We hypothesize that LC patients exhibit unique antibody profiles against HP and other co-infected bacteria, viruses and fungi compared with controls. A proteome-scale, comprehensive study of the humoral immune responses against INDIVIDUAL Helicobacter pylori and other microbial proteins will reveal links between LC and a history of HP and co-infections better than microbial infection status alone does.  Protein arrays offer a multiplexed, high-throughput platform to profile antibody immune responses against thousands of proteins in parallel. We will develop a protein array displaying ~12,000 microbial proteins with an emphasis on the full proteome of HP and antigens by microorganisms reported to be associated to LC and lung diseases.  CT screening can significantly reduce LC mortality; however, it suffers from high false positive rates. Microbial infection is a common cause of pulmonary nodules. To this end, besides high-risk smoker controls, we will also profile antibodies with samples collected from benign pulmonary nodule and benign lung disease controls. The study of clinically relevant groups will yield antibodies differentially elicited by different groups of subjects that can differentiate LC from benign nodules detected by CT screening and reduce unnecessary invasive tests to improve patient management. Improved knowledge of the link between HP and LC may help identify cancer diagnostics, manage risks, and develop prevention strategies.  ",
FP00029712,591,,,,,1,,,"Supporting Early Literacy Development of Preschool Children with Drama Integration: An Experimental Evaluation of Early Years Educators at Play (EYEPlay)   PI: Katie A. Bernstein, kbernstein@asu.edu Institution: Arizona State University   High-quality preschool experiences are critical to reducing opportunity gaps for children of color, children from low-income families, and children learning English in school. Effective teacher professional development (PD) programs have been shown to contribute to high-quality preschools (Griffith et al., 2010). In particular, effective teacher PD in drama has demonstrated potential to improve preschool student achievement in language and literacy while exposing students to the arts (Lee et al., 2015; Podlozny, 2000). The proposed evaluation aims to study the effects of Early Years Educators at Play (EYEPlay), a strengths-based, classroom-embedded, apprenticeship-model PD program in which preschool teachers learn to integrate drama into storytime. Developed by Childsplay, a non-profit youth theater company in metro Phoenix, EYEPlay pairs professional teaching artists with preschool teachers to develop teachers knowledge and skill in using drama strategies (e.g., pantomime) to support childrens story comprehension and engagement. In a prior, quasi-experimental study (funder: Helios Education Foundation) measuring the effectiveness of the EYEPlay program in 32 preschool classrooms serving linguistically-diverse and low-SES students in metro Phoenix, researchers found increases in:    teachers knowledge of early literacy standards, drama strategies, and best practices in early learning instruction; teachers sense of efficacy in instructional strategies, student engagement, and positive classroom management; and students literacy skills, as measured by teachers observational assessments (Chapman et al., 2016; Kelley, 2015; Kilinc et al., 2016a, 2016b). The study provided support for EYEPlays effectiveness, but did not employ standardized measures of childrens literacy or include control classrooms to provide a comparison group. In 2019, therefore, Childsplay and Arizona State University received a grant (U351D180096-20; $2.2 million) from the US Department of Education (DoED) to fund a randomized control trial evaluation of EYEPlay in 90 preschool classrooms (45 intervention; 45 control) over three years, using standardized measures of childrens language and literacy. The first cohort (2019-2020) completed programming and most evaluation before COVID-19. Due to subsequent restrictions on classroom data collection during COVID-19, a second cohort received modified programming but no evaluation. Thus, even with significant increases in programming and evaluation planned for 2021-2022, we will not meet the requisite sample size to complete the evaluation. Although the DoED has agreed to a no-cost extension, the remaining funds are enough for an additional year of programming or evaluation, but not both. We therefore propose to leverage the remaining DoED funds for a fourth year of EYEPlay programming, while using Brady Education Foundation funds to complete the program evaluation, allowing a sufficiently powered study to reach conclusions about EYEPlays effectiveness at promoting language and literacy outcomes. Such conclusions would provide funders, the education community, and public policymakers with experimental evidence as to the effectiveness of using drama integration to support academic achievement for linguistically-, racially-, and socio-economically diverse populations of preschool students.

Non-fatal overdose Expanded TasksTask 3: Effectiveness of treatment. Treatment retention, abstinence from opioids, and negative urine drug screens are often the gold standard for measuring treatment success in OUD. The research will analyze these measures and other measures of intensity of treatment, including, counseling encounters, supply days, retention, etc. Analyses will provide details into subpopulations by demographics, ethnicity, geography, and types of treatment, time between diagnosis and treatment, etc. Also, patients have individualized goals that affect their engagement with treatment. For example, goals can be stopping OUD treatment altogether and maintaining medication, and others would like to taper off, but not stop while reducing illicit drug use. Other goals include increasing life stability, improving social and family relationships, and improving physical life and housing to support their families. The team will use the review from Sanger, et al. (2022) to develop a methodology to include patient reported outcomes of treatment effectiveness to inform stakeholders and policymakers. Guidance will be based on clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS), opioid risk tool (ORT), and NIDA timeline back flow (TLBF). Can dynamic interventions for overdoses and increase treatment adherence, including patient reported outcomes, be executed and implemented? Sanger N., et al.

FP00029724,595,,,,,1,,,"Summary/AbstractResearch studies concerning diet and disease require accurate information regarding energy intake (EI), such asfor tracking calories consumed. In intervention studies, EI is often a controlled variable (e.g., calorie restriction,CR), and is also a commonly-used outcome measure. Although a number of dietary intake assessment toolsare available, most of those having applicability in free-living individuals rely on self-report and are associatedwith large reporting error. Such error can obscure the relationship between EI and nutrition and morbidity,and thereby aect intervention study outcomes. More objective measures are needed that are accurate andprecise, but not highly technical or expensive, as are other approaches, such as doubly labeled water (DLW)and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This R21 grant application addresses PAR-18-857, Diet andPhysical Activity Assessment Methodology [42], which spans the development of: novel assessment approaches;better methods to evaluate instruments; assessment tools for culturally diverse populations or various agegroups, including children and older adults; improved technology or applications of existing technology; statisticalmethods/modeling to improve assessment and/or to correct for measurement errors or biases; methods toinvestigate the multidimensionality of diet and physical activity behavior through pattern analysis; or integratedmeasurement of diet and physical activity along with the environmental context of such behaviors.The goal of this R21 program is to demonstrate the feasibility of an economical and easy-to-use objec-tive method for assessing EI in free-living individuals. The proposed Energy Intake Tracker (EIT) overcomesmany of the limitations and problems associated with current caloric intake and physical activity measurementmethodologies. A unique attribute of the EIT approach is its provision for simple, automated calibration of EIassessments in individuals and easy-to-use, but sophisticated, analytic techniques in place of complex and expen-sive laboratory methods. With the proposed method, bias (i.e., additive) errors, which are the bane of subjectiveassessments, and gain (i.e., multiplicative) errors, which are a signicant challenge even for existing objectiveassessments due to imperfect correlation between measurement variables, are reduced substantially. The EITapproach will improve EI estimation accuracy and precision, which in practice are presently limited to group-level(vs. individual-level) results when using self-report measures, and to multi-day averages (vs. daily results) whenusing more complex, expensive, and sophisticated measurement techniques, such as assessment of total energyexpenditure (TEE) via DLW and changes in body composition (BC) (i.e., fat and fat-free mass percentages) viaDXA. EIT provides a low-cost and less-complex alternative, furnishing a Goldilocks solution situated betweensimple self-report and elaborate measurement techniques vis--vis accuracy and precision. Herein, subjectsinitial 4 weeks of CR diet data will be used to calibrate individual-level models; subjects following 4 weeks ofCR diet data will be used to assess these models. Ground truth EI will be known in each subject for all 8 weeks.",
FP00029744,596,,,,,1,,,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of synchronous telehealth in the form of telepsychiatry, interest and use of asynchronous telehealth delivered via smartphone apps has also expanded. According to industry reports, searches for apps for depression rose by 156% and mindfulness by 2483%. While mental health apps are making help more accessible via smartphones, questions remain regarding their effectiveness. This study is designed to assess root causes of lower effectiveness related to engagement, explore the impact of race on use, and utilize novel digital phenotyping methods to create personalized engagement models to increase app utilization and effectiveness.  A meta-analysis on mental health apps offering mindfulness strategies has shown a small but positive effect across diverse populations, although such benefits are often diminished in real world use cases outside of clinical studies. This study is designed to address these real world challenges through a unique partnership between a mental health app with the highest number of users in the world, Calm, and an academic team at Harvard University and The University of Pennsylvania with strong experiences assessing digital phenotyping and machine learning models to predict outcomes and engagement. In addition, this study addresses a critical gap in the field by focusing on outcomes of app based engagement and interventions in minority populations who stand to benefit the most from this new mode of care. Today few studies have been able to address these critical challenges as they lack large diverse samples, digital phenotyping capabilities, and effective app based mindfulness interventions. Given Calm has over four million paying users, oversampling Hispantic, Black, and Asian populations to reflect unmet mental health needs is highly feasible and will generate one of the largest data sets on minority digital health.  Using digital phenotyping to capture a wide variety of behaviors, such as sleeping habits, social metrics, and mobility patterns, we will be able to assess real world, dynamic, and functional outcomes to discover the role that digital biomarkers, when used as covariates in our predictive models, play in identifying the ideal personalized recommendation to make the Calm app more engaging and effective.",
FP00029762,597,,,,,1,,,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can map the uptake and retention of physiologically targeted, radio-labelled molecules like fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG) for the detection of hypermetabolic tissues like cancer, 15O for the measurement of blood flow and tissue perfusion, and Pittsburg compound B (PiB) for the detection  of  beta-amyloid  deposition  in  the  study  of  Alzheimers  disease.  A  particular  strength  of  PET  is  its exquisite  sensitivity  to  radio-labelled  species  which  enables  detection  of  tracers  at  ultra-low  pico-molar concentrations  a feature that allows scientists and clinicians to probe normal and pathologic physiology without perturbing homeostasis. For these reasons, PET continues to make a major impact in the understanding and clinical monitoring of health and disease. This Basic Instrumentation Grant (BIG) Program application requests funds to purchase an MRS*PET Clip-on PET-detector ring manufactured by MR Solutions for the purpose of supporting the biomedical and bioimaging research efforts of the Arizona State University research community.  Arizona State University (ASU) is a major research one university which had $673M in research expenditures in 2020, including $52M in NIH research expenditures alone. Much of these research efforts are put towards the study of cancer, diabetes, aging, neurological diseases, basic homeostatic physiology, and drug discovery. In an effort to enhance biomedical and bioimaging research efforts and to meet the needs of its rapidly growing faculty of biomedical researchers, ASU has recently made the remarkable commitment to establish a preclinical imaging facility. This commitment has been underscored by the hire of three new imaging faculty in the recent three years and the purchase of an MR Solutions Powerscan rampable preclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  system.  While  the  purchase  of  this  MRI  instrumentation  and  the  hire  of  imaging  faculty  will  certainly advance ASUs biomedical research efforts in studying health and disease, the ability of MRI to probe physiologic function lags significantly behind that of PET. Many ASU researchers need access to PET for the purpose of non-invasive and longitudinal quantification of physiological functions like glucose and amino acid metabolism, hypoxia, blood flow, and beta-amyloid deposition, amongst many other applications; however, ASU does not have PET imaging facilities. Herein, we seek to complement our MR Solutions Powerscan rampable preclinical MRI system and ASUs with the MRS*PET Clip-on PET-detector ring device manufactured by MR Solutions.  The  MR  Solutions  MRS*PET  Clip-on  is  designed  specifically  to  interface  with  ASUs  existing  MR  Solutions Powerscan preclinical MRI system. This combination would constitute a completely integrated pre-clinical PET-MRI system for fully automated sequential MRI and PET imaging of laboratory mice, rats, and small primates. The MR Solutions MRS*PET Clip-on Rings state-of-the art imaging capabilities and seamless integration with existing MRI instrumentation at ASU make this device the clear choice for ASUs PET imaging needs.

Expansion of Existing Literature  Existing systematic reviews have identified general bias toward people with SUD, as well as bias and stigma exhibited by healthcare professionals toward patients with SUD.5,6 One systematic review examined interventions for addressing such stigma.7 Most recently, Bielenberg et al. published a systematic review examining studies through 2019 of interventions for providers who treat people with SUD, akin to the review solicited in this request for proposals.8  This research team will expound upon existing SUD stigma literature by conducting a systematic review of literature pertaining to the role of stigma in the prescribing of and referrals to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone). Despite strong evidence of MOUD efficacy at decreasing mortality,9 fewer than 20% of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) use MOUD,10 and half of rural counties lack practitioners with the federal waiver required to prescribe buprenorphine in office-based settings.11 Relatedly, most practitioners with a waiver are prescribing below their patient limit.12, 13 Further, while practitioners outside of opioid treatment programs (OTPs) can prescribe naltrexone or refer patients to methadone treatment, both medications remain underutilized.14, 15 Therefore, a critical need exists to understand barriers to prescribing and/or referring patients to MOUD.  Healthcare provider stigmatization of patients with SUD has been documented as a reason for few providers offering MOUD.16 Previous literature has indicated concerns among providers about the risk of courtesy stigma (stigma incurred from treating stigmatized patients). Previous literature also indicates provider concerns that patients with SUD are difficult, dissuading waiver-eligible practitioners from applying for the waiver. Studies also suggests practitioner concerns that offering MOUD would expose patients without SUD to patients with SUD, causing patients without SUD to leave the practice.17, 18, 19  Despite indications that provider stigma toward patients with SUD serves as a barrier to MOUD prescribing/referrals, no systematic review has examined the relationship between provider stigmatization of patients with SUD and the following outcomes: buprenorphine waiver uptake, buprenorphine prescribing/referrals, naltrexone prescribing/referrals, or methadone/OTP referrals. Relatedly, the extent to which SUD stigma is a barrier to MOUD prescribing/referrals, as compared to other barriers (e.g., prior authorization), has not been explored via a systematic review, nor have the ways in which stigma manifests among providers prescribing/referring for MOUD (e.g., prescribing buprenorphine to fewer patients than limits allow). Therefore, we propose to conduct a systematic literature review to address this gap.  The primary research question to inform the systematic review will be: What role does healthcare provider bias toward patients with SUD play in willingness of providers who work outside of OTPs or specialty SUD treatment settings to prescribe/refer for MOUD? Our secondary research question is: In these treatment settings, how does healthcare provider bias toward patients with SUD manifest? To date, scholars and policymakers have focused on interventions to address barriers to MOUD prescribing/referrals, such as prior authorization requirements,20 lack of insurance coverage,21 scope of practice restrictions,22 the waiver requirement,23 and limited knowledge/experience,24, 25 but fewer interventions have focused on addressing the barrier of stigma. Therefore, this review could contribute to the development of policies to increase MOUD access. We will focus on community-based settings, including physician offices and primary care clinics, as these have been identified as key settings for expanding MOUD to underserved populations due to availability and lower cost than specialty settings.26 We will exclude OTPs and specialty settings (e.g., residential SUD treatment), since by virtue of working in such settings, providers have implied willingness to treat SUD. More immediately, this review could help healthcare organizations seeking to increase MOUD referrals/prescribing in community settings, with applications for: 1) health professions education (e.g., graduate medical education); 2) direct practice initiatives (e.g., continuing medical education).   III. Processes for Conducting the Systematic Review 1)  Lead authors will meet with the medical librarian to discuss search terms and develop a search protocol. Main reviewers and the stakeholder team will clarify data to be extracted from studies, including study design, participant information (e.g., setting, demographic data), intervention information (e.g., processes), outcome information (e.g., measurement tools, timing), and results (e.g., number of participants included/withdrawn, between group estimates).  2)  BA, AL, and DS will serve as main reviewers, with two appointed to review the title and abstract of each article after exclusions have been applied. They will use COVIDENCE software to indicate whether they choose to include, exclude, or are unsure. Individuals from the stakeholder team (AE, EK, and CA) will serve as tiebreakers.  3)  The librarian will obtain the full text for included article abstracts from step #2. BA, AL, and DS will serve as main reviewers, with two appointed to review the full-text of each article to determine inclusion. They will use COVIDENCE to indicate whether they choose to include, exclude, or are unsure. Individuals from the stakeholder team (AE, EK, and CA) will serve as tiebreakers for inclusion/exclusion decisions following review of the full text.  4)  The librarian and main reviewers will complete a secondary search of reference lists to identify missing articles (snowballing), as well as a search of the gray literature. Identified articles will be compared against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The research team will also consult with outside experts regarding any missing articles.  5)  The main reviewers and stakeholder team will create a data extraction form in COVIDENCE based on the protocol/data extraction plan. Multiple reports from the same study will be linked. Two primary reviewers will be assigned to extract data from each study and disagreement will be resolved through discussion.  6)  Each study will be evaluated by two main reviewers for bias and quality in design, conduct, and reporting using validated appraisal tools including the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2 (RoB 2).27 Members of the stakeholder group will serve as tie breakers.  7)  The main reviewers will summarize the characteristics of each study using PICO (Patient or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome)28 categories pre-specified in the protocol and create a table demonstrating similarities, or lack thereof, of PICO category characteristics across studies. In preparation for synthesis, studies in similar categories will be grouped. Data will be synthesized by the main reviewers and stakeholder group to provide a narrative summary of intervention effects. Implications of these results will be discussed with the stakeholder group.  Inclusion criteria will be as follows: 1) population studied: practitioners eligible to obtain a buprenorphine waiver (note: these individuals are also eligible to prescribe naltrexone and refer for methadone), 2) interventions or exposures: studies of buprenorphine waiver uptake, buprenorphine prescribing or referrals, naltrexone prescribing or referrals, or methadone/OTP referrals, 3) outcomes of interest: percentage of each of the following types of studies in which stigmatization of patients is identified as a barrier: studies of waiver uptake, buprenorphine prescribing or referrals, naltrexone prescribing or referrals, and methadone/OTP referrals; the relative importance/extent of patient SUD stigmatization as a barrier compared to other barriers (e.g., whether it was the primary barrier identified in the study); and ways in which stigmatization of patients manifests in MOUD referrals/prescribing (e.g., prescribing MOUD for a short duration of time; accepting few patients for MOUD treatment), 4) setting: outpatient/community-based settings (e.g., primary care clinics) that are not OTPs or specialty SUD treatment, 5) study designs: any, with or without a control group, including observational/cohort and randomized controlled trials with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods, and 6) publications between 2011-2021. Exclusion criteria will include: 1) reviews, commentaries and letters, 2) studies originating outside the U.S. and Canada, 3) studies outside the health professions, 4) studies published prior to 2011. The research question will be refined using the PICO format as an initial framework. The research team will adhere to the PRISMA-P protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols) in synthesizing and reporting the findings.29 IV. Literature Sources to be Searched/Included in the Systematic Review The lead authors and stakeholder team will meet with the medical librarian to determine search terms. The medical librarian team will search MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using primary search terms. The team will complete a secondary search of reference lists to identify any missing articles (snowballing), as well as a search of the gray literature. Identified articles will be compared against the inclusion and exclusion criteria for appropriateness.  V.

FP00029875,599,,,,,1,,,"Decades of research support the effectiveness of family-based interventions to prevent and manage pediatric obesity. Until recently, such programs were designed to maximize potential efficacy with little attention to implementability in primary care, which, for reasons due to appropriateness and acceptability, is the ideal delivery system in which to embed effective obesity interventions. Despite endorsement from the US Preventive Services Task Force, few such interventions have been widely implemented in primary care, and fewer still have achieved sustainment, resulting in limited access for families and public health impact. This application focuses on the evidence-based Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), a family-based intervention adapted from the Family Check-Up (FCU), with demonstrated effects on family and child health behaviors. A selective intervention trial was recently conducted in partnership with multiple primary care systems (outpatient hospital based, FQHCs) enrolling 240 primarily Mexican American and low-income families in a large metropolitan area. Eligible patients were =5.5 to <13 years old and had elevated BMI (=85th percentile for age and gender) at their most recent primary care visit. FCU4Health significantly improved family and child health behaviors (d=.18.40) and child social-emotional health (d=.19.29), and showed meaningful change in child BMI (d=.20), compared to usual care. As hypothesized, child outcomes were mediated by program effects on parenting and family health routines. Given this evidence that FCU4Health is effective at improving obesogenic child and family behaviors, while also promoting social-emotional health, interest in adoption by integrated primary care organizations has increased. A universal prevention trial with 200 primarily Mexican American and low-income families with a 2- to 5-year-old child is currently underway in an integrated primary care system. During these two trials, with guidance from the RE-AIM framework, and a Community Advisory Board that has overseen FCU4Health development and testing, the study team identified several implementation barriers (reach, fidelity, engagement). Technology-based implementation strategies (clinical decision support, automated fidelity monitoring, SMS text messaging platform) were developed to overcome them and ensure delivery at scale. In the proposed bi-phasic study, the R61 phase involves integration of strategies with the electronic medical record system, usability testing, and workflow analysis. In the R33 phase, a hybrid type 2 cluster randomized factorial trial will be conducted with ~110 coordinators and ~1100 families to examine main and interaction effects of the strategies on implementation outcomes (i.e., fidelity, engagement) and clinical effectiveness (BMI, child health behaviors, family health routines, parenting). Implementation cost analyses to examine the economic impact and cost-effectiveness of each strategy will also be performed. Results of the study have the potential for a public health impact on pediatric obesity by facilitating the scale-up of effective, evidence-based, and cost-efficient obesity interventions for families in primary care settings.",
FP00029875_Res1,600,,,,,1,,,"Decades of research support the effectiveness of family-centered preventive interventions (FCPIs)in limiting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk for children. Pediatric primary care offers the ideal delivery system in which to embed effective FCPIs for CVD risk given goal alignment, parents trust in and longitudinal contact with pediatricians, and reach into communities facing CVD disparities. Despite endorsement from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, few FCPIs have been widely implemented in primary care, resulting in limited access for families and public health impact. This application focuses on facilitating the widespread implementation of the evidence-based Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), a FCPI with demonstrated positive effects on family and child health behaviors. To test the FCU4Health, we conducted an RCT with 240 primarily Mexican American and low-income families in partnership with multiple primary care systems. Children were =5.5 to <13 years old and had elevated BMI (=85th percentile for age and gender) at their most recent primary care visit. Compared to usual care, FCU4Health significantly improved child and family health behaviors, child social-emotional health, and resulted in meaningful change in child BMI at a magnitude consistent with other interventions. Given this positive evidence, integrated primary care organizations have become increasingly interested in its adoption. Our universal prevention trial with 217 primarily Mexican American and low-income families with a 2- to 5-year-old child is currently underway in an integrated primary care system. During these two trials, with guidance from the RE-AIM framework, and a Community Advisory Board that has overseen FCU4Health development and testing, several implementation barriers were identified affecting its reach, fidelity, and engagement. Technology-based implementation strategies (a clinical decision support tool, automated fidelity monitoring, and an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-integrated SMS text messaging platform) were developed to promote delivery at scale. In the proposed biphasic study, the R61 phase involves integration of these strategies with the EHR and usability testing. In the R33 phase, a hybrid type 3 cluster randomized factorial trial will be conducted with 150 coordinators and 1200 families to examine effects of the strategies on fidelity and engagement (primary implementation outcomes) and child health behaviors (primary clinical outcomes), family health routines, parenting skills, and child BMI. Prospective implementation cost analyses will be performed to examine the economic impact and cost-effectiveness of each strategy. Finally, we will model trajectories of child and family health behaviors and examine the associations with BMI at the 18-month follow-up. The large sample size will allow us to examine these associations by baseline characteristics (BMI, developmental stage, race/ethnicity, and gender). Results have the potential for a significant public health impact on CVD risk by facilitating the scale-up of effective interventions for families in primary care settings.",
FP00029921_Res1,601,,,,,1,,,"Many current clinical trials in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimers disease are using biomarkers (e.g., positive on amyloid imaging) as part of the inclusion criteria. Similarly, biomarkers are becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of Alzheimers disease and other types of dementia. However, many of thesebiomarkers are costly, invasive, provide little clinical information, and may be only completed at sites with unique resources. The rationale for this project is the need for more practical markers of disease and its progression, which could be used to enrich clinical trials. Research suggests that motor behavior is a simple and widely accessible solution for improving enrichment and streamlining participant screening that hassubstantial cost- and time-savings. The long-term goal is to develop a quick, cheap, and easy-to-administer motor assessment as a tool for prognostic enrichment of AD clinical trial selection or for making AD screening more accessible. The overall objective of this new application is to demonstrate that individuals with poorermotor task acquisition are likely to be identified as positive on amyloid imaging and other biomarkers, consistent with NOT-AG-21-044: Sensory and Motor System Changes as Predictors of Preclinical Alzheimers Disease. This project leverages existing cohorts of older individuals who are cognitively intact as well as thosewith Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimers disease. The aims of this pragmatic project will offer more efficient screening in recruiting for clinical trials, which would reduce participant burden and financial costs associated with these trials. The proposed motor task could also be used to enrich trials with those more likelyto progress and to monitor treatment benefit as a proximal outcome measure. The affordability, portability, and accessibility of this innovative motor task are also relevant to Goal F of the National Institute on Agings Strategic Directions for Research, 2020-2025 by offering a tool that could address three key health disparities:socioeconomic status, geographic location, and health care access.",

Fibrin is a significant component of blood clots. However, the life-saving process of clot formation can become life-threatening if a clot blocks a blood vessel. Indeed, clot-related pathologies, including heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolism, account for ~50% of all hospital deaths. The fibrinolytic pathway does the opposite of coagulation by dissolving clots, where plasmin is the main enzyme degrading fibrin. Reperfusion, the act of restoring blood flow by activating plasminogen to plasmin using the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is the standard treatment for ischemic stroke. Adverse side effects and cost of tPA motivate alternative approaches to treat clots. The fibrinolytic activity observed in plasminogen-deleted animals suggests alternative proteolytic pathways. In this context, the fibrinolytic activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) provides an intriguing possibility in the coagulation and fibrinolysis, which we propose to study using a combination of single molecule experiments, ensemble assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and innovative analyses.",
FP00030000,603,,,,,1,,,"Personalized Machine Learning: Bayesian Decision Trees for Heterogeneous Data Analysis1. IntroductionModern data-driven research requires analyzing large datasets that generally include samples from di-verse and heterogeneous populations. For example, the All of US Research Program, launched by theNational Institute of Health (NIH) in 2015, plans to recruit one million people across the U.S. to build largeand diverse health databases. Analyzing such data is a challenge, especially due to the heterogeneity. Thetraditional supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms focus on developing the best predictive model, as-suming one can nd a common set of features across all the heterogeneous samples. These one-size-ts-allML algorithms would be too restricted to analyze heterogeneous data.Our motivating data is a detect pathogen-induced cancers(DPIC) project from Arizona State University and Mayo Clinic,funded by the NIH from 2016 to 2020. They collected 599 coloncancer samples (Y = 1, cases) and age and sex matched 599 healthcontrol samples (Y = 0, controls), and proled 3308 anti-microbialantibody responses (X1, . . . , X3308) to understand the relationshipbetween microbial infections and colon cancers, where higher Xjimplies infection of the jth microbial. It is known that no singleinfection can cause the cancers, so it is of interest to nd a combina-tion of infections, so-called co-infections, but co-infection patternscan vary from patient to patient. The traditional supervised ML al-gorithms do not account for such heterogeneity, as explained in theabove paragraph, resulting in lower receiver operating characteris-tics (ROC) curves as seen in Figure 1. For the same reason, unsuper-vised principal component analysis (PCA) does not differentiate thecancers and controls. A novel ML algorithm is needed to analyzeDPIC or similar studies including highly heterogeneous and diversesamples.Consider personalized (or precision) medicine that tailors medi-cal treatment to patients according to their individual characteristics[Kosorok and Laber, 2019]. While their focus is to infer an opti-mal treatment decision, we can extend the concept by suggesting apersonalized ML (PML) that tailors the ML algorithm to subjectsaccording to their individual features. We can solve this problemby separating the heterogeneous samples into K subgroups of whowould benet the most from targeted ML, which can improve MLperformances compared to the traditional one-size-ts-all ML al-gorithms. One can identify K subgroups using clustering techniquesand develop subgroup-specic MLs, which would be straightfor-ward but not provide an optimal solution. To address this need, wepropose the following aims:Aim 1. Develop a supervised PML using Bayesian classicationand regression tree (CART) models.Aim 2. Develop an unsupervised PML using Bayesian CART.Aim 3. Develop a publicly available R package that implements the methods.1Figure 1: DPIC analysis results.Top: ROC curves for least abso-lute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO), random forest (RF), XG-Boost, and Bayesian additive regres-sion trees (BART). Bottom: PCAThe main contribution of our proposed methods is to provide a new paradigm of the PML by suggestingnovel methods and tools to analyze highly heterogeneous data under the exible Bayesian tree framework.To our knowledge, no publications are available regarding PMLs, and some use the PML terminology in adifferent context. For example, Shah et al. [2021] refers to the PDM as the ensemble learning that appliesmultiple ML algorithms to the same dataset and aggregates their results. These approaches could improverobustness but are not designed for heterogeneous data analysis. Technical details about our proposed meth-ods are further discussed in the section below.2. Technical Details: Personalized Bayesian CARTDenote Yi as a continuous (or binary) variable, and Xi =(Xi1, . . . , Xip) as a p dimensional feature vector for the ith subjects,i = 1, . . . , n. Under a binary tree structure, our goal is to separatethe patients into K terminal nodes (or subgroups) along with ML al-gorithm fk() at each terminal node for k = 1, . . . , K. Let Sk be theset consisting of those who belong to the terminal node k. For super-vised ML, for example, fk() is a map from Xi to Yi for i  Sk. WhenK = 3, the tree structure in Figure 2 is characterized by (i) splittingrules: X1 and X2, (ii) splitting values: 1 and 2 for X1 and X2, respec-tively, (iii) terminal node specic ML algorithms: f1, f2 and f3. Underthe Bayesian framework, the entire tree structures are regarded as prob-abilities. We can thus parametrize (i) and (ii) by Chipman et al. [1998]and (iii) by any ML algorithms with prior specication. For (iii), thesimplest case would be to use Bayesian linear regression of the formYi = 0k + 1kXi[k] +  + qkXi[q] for i  Sk with q  p by specify-ing conjugate priors of (0k, . . . , qk). Here, (Xi[1], . . . , Xi[q]) is a setof selected features among (Xi1, . . . , Xip). We can then derive a poste-rior distribution of the tree structure and apply the MetropolisHastingsalgorithm to stochastically search the optimal tree structure by maxi-mizing the posterior based on specic techniques, called Grow, Prune,Swap, Change, and Assignment. Here, the rst four steps are suggestedby Chipman et al. [1998], while we additionally propose the last stepto search the optimal (Xi[1], . . . , Xi[q]) and fk(). A different form offk() can be specied such as Bayesian PCA for unsupervised learning.Multiple integrals would be needed to explicitly derive the posteriordistribution depending on how we set the form of fk(), which can beefciently computed using modern numerical integration techniques.We will conduct extensive simulations and real-data analyses by comparing our proposed and traditionalML algorithms. We will develop an R package that implements our proposed methods. The study timelineand expected outcomes are described as below:Figure 2: Top: hypothetical ex-ample of a binary tree, with inter-nal nodes labelled by their splittingrule and terminal nodes labelledwith the corresponding predictivemodels.

FP00030045,604,,,,,1,,,"Migraine is an extraordinarily prevalent neurological disease and the second overall cause for years lived with disability. There is limited literature pertaining to health disparities and migraine, which further exacerbates disparities for vulnerable populations and necessitates a deeper examination of the social determinants of health (SDoH) and lived experiences of communities with disproportionately poor migraine outcomes. Utilizing Arizona Medicaid (i.e., AHCCCS) claims data available through the Center for Health Information and Research (CHiR), there is a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between SDoH and migraine/headache diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment based on Z codes. Required since April 2018, Z codes are provided in the ICD-10-CM for the reporting of factors influencing health status such as education/literacy, employment, occupational exposures, housing, food security, transportation, and problems relating to social environment/upbringing/family circumstances/psychosocial circumstances. This retrospective review will test the hypothesis that increased exposure to negative SDoH is associated with lower rates of sub-specialty health care encounters, higher rates of receiving the non-specific diagnosis of headache over the specific diagnosis of migraine, and lower rates of guideline recommended prescriptions and diagnostic tests. This study will assess the frequency of migraine/headache diagnosis among all ages of AHCCCS recipients and describe the relationships between migraine/headache diagnoses with demographic variables including gender, age, race/ethnicity, and rural/urban residence. We will investigate the frequency and types of migraine/headache treatments that are prescribed, encounters with health providers for indication of migraine/headache, and utilization of diagnostic testing based on demographic variables and Z codes.",
FP00030086,605,,,,,1,,,"SPECIFIC AIMSHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. According to the CDC, liver cancer is the only cancer for which both the incidence and mortality are rising: between 2003 and 2012, the incidence of liver cancer increased by 38% and the mortality increased by 56%. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) constitutes an increasingly significant risk factor for HCC. Although transplant and resection offer the greatest chance of survival from HCC, few patients are eligible. Most patients undergo percutaneous thermal ablation (PTA), including cryoablation or microwave ablation, or locoregional therapies, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and transarterial radioembolization (TARE). Even nonoperative patients and patients with Child Pugh B cirrhosis may be eligible for these liver-directed therapies. Nonetheless, recurrence is common, whether due to growth of residual tumor cells or the development of new tumors due to the underlying liver disease. There is a critical need to reduce recurrence and improve outcomes following liver-directed therapies for HCC.We have shown that time-restricted feeding (TRF) can prevent liver cancer in a genetic multifocal tumor model. This effect is likely due to TRF-mediated improvements in liver metabolism, steatosis and fibrosis. In humans, TRF can be feasibly achieved with prolonged nightly fasting (PROFAST). Given the close association between HCC and metabolic liver disease and the lack of feasible behavioral modifications to improve outcomes in HCC patients, PROFAST represents a promising strategy to reduce HCC recurrence after liver-directed therapies. We hypothesize that circadian alignment of food intake leads to metabolic benefits and is a safe, feasible, and effective adjuvant practice for improving liver-directed therapy outcomes in individuals with HCC. Thus, we are proposing a randomized, controlled phase 1 clinical trial to test whether PROFAST is safe and feasible in HCC patients and whether it can reduce HCC progression and recurrence. Preclinical mechanistic studies will be pursued in parallel to help inform the direction of subsequent clinical trials.Specific Aim 1. To test whether prolonged nightly fasting (Live PROFAST) is feasible in overweight adults undergoing liver-directed therapy for HCC. We will enroll 100 overweight patients (age 18+ years; BMI 27-45 kg/m2) who are undergoing liver-directed therapy for HCC in a 2-arm randomized controlled trial Live PROFAST. Intervention group participants will fast for 12-14 hours each night for 6 months; an attention control group will be the comparator. During the active intervention period, participants will have standard-of-care clinic visits, including biospecimen collections at baseline and at 3-month intervals. Monitoring of fasting, feasibility/safety, and biomarkers will include 6- and 12-month time points.a. To determine feasibility as primary outcome, gauged by safety acceptability, and adherence.b. To conduct preliminary evaluations of intervention associated change in mechanistic metabolic biomarkers, modifiable behavior outcomes (diet, sleep, and physical activity), quality of life, and tumor recurrence outcomes.c. To explore the moderating effects of metformin in those who are taking it at enrollment.Specific Aim 2. To test whether TRF enhances the efficiency of cryoablation for HCC. In this Aim, we will test whether TRF can reduce recurrence after cryoablation of focal HCC tumors. These experiments will be performed in four liver cancer models: two single foci orthotopic tumor models, a genetic multifocal tumor model, and a patient-derived xenograft model. Tumor ablation will be performed by ultrasound-guided cryoablation, and tumor regression and recurrence will be monitored by ultrasound.Specific Aim 3. To dissect the mechanisms underlying the effect of TRF on HCC growth. In this Aim, we will pursue experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of TRF on tumor growth. We will test whether the protective effect is due to reducing the chronic hyperinsulinemia associated with metabolic dysregulation. Alternatively, we will test whether the prolonged fasting allows the liver to switch to -oxidation of hepatic fatty acids, reducing hepatic glucose production but increasing ketone body production and hence reducing glycolysis in the tumor cells via an anti-Warburg effect. Lastly, we will test whether synchronization of circadian gene expression in tumor cells in response to TRF is needed to inhibit proliferation.Impact. This proposal combines a behavioral intervention trial with synergistic preclinical studies. The feasibility trial will assess the intervention fit for this high-need cancer patient population with poor prognoses. The preclinical experiments in mice will inform future clinical trial biomarkers, and elucidate potential biomarkers for tumor regression and recurrence and reveal the mechanisms dictating the optimal timing and duration of TRF.",
FP00030086_Res1,606,,,,,1,,,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. According to the CDC, liver cancer is the only cancer for which both the incidence and mortality are rising; between 2003 and 2012, the incidence of liver cancer increased by 38% and the mortality increased by 56%. The American Cancer Society predicts that there will be 42,230 new cases of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in 2021 and 30,230 deaths, which underscores the poor survival rate from these cancers with a 5-year survival rate of only 19%. In the US, the population attributable fraction of HCC is highest for obesity or the metabolic syndrome (37%), followed by alcoholic-related disease (24%), hepatitis C virus (22%) and hepatitis B virus (6%). Approximately 80-90% of obese adults have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the metabolic syndrome, and a subset will go on to develop inflammation and NASH. Obesity is a risk factor not only for NASH-related liver cancer, but also for HBV and HCV-related liver cancer and even alcoholic cirrhosis-related liver cancer.  Obesity also reduces the efficacy of anti-HBV vaccination, and increases HCC in individuals treated for HCV. As obese individuals are at a higher risk of developing all types of HCC (non-viral, viral and alcoholic), there is a critical need to improve both prevention and the efficacy and durability of HCC treatments.Although transplant and resection offer the greatest hope of survival from HCC, few patients are eligible. Most patients undergo minimally invasive, liver-directed therapies, including percutaneous thermal ablation (i.e. radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterialradioembolization (TARE). While these therapies can control disease and prolong life, recurrence remains a significant risk and common occurrence. Recurrence may arise from residual tumor or new tumors developing in the setting of liver disease. In individuals treated for HCC, obesity increases the risk of recurrence.  This is true for patients treated by resection, transplantation, or embolization.  We propose a novel method to minimize the risk of recurrence in HCC patients who have undergone liver-directed therapies. In preclinical studies, we have shown that time-restricted feeding (TRF) can prevent liver cancer in a genetic multifocal tumor model. This is likely due to the improvements in liver metabolism, steatosis, and fibrosis by TRF. Given the close association of HCC and metabolic liver disease, TRF represents a viable strategy to reduce HCC recurrence. Thus, we are proposing a human feasibility study to test whether a prolonged nightly fast (Live PROFAST), to mimic TRF in mice, is safe and feasible in HCC patients, and whether it can improve liver metabolism and reduce liver cancer-associated outcomes. These studies will be paralleled by preclinical mechanistic studies that can help inform the direction of the human studies. If successful, prolonged nightly fasting could represent a powerful tool for patients to mitigate their risk of HCC recurrence while improving other metabolic sequelae of obesity.",
FP00030105,607,,,,,1,,,"OVERVIEW: Humans navigate auditory scenes by transforming the acoustic mixture in their environment into a spatial, nearly real-time internal representation of the individual sound sources that produced that scene. This auditory scene analysis is usually studied with stationary listeners presented with two stationary sound sources without reverberation: rather unlike our more dynamic, daily conditions. Furthermore, investigations usually focus on cognitive processing and attention. However, the brain bases its estimates of the outside world on the neural activity driven by these stimuli, not the acoustic waveforms themselves. We take a step back and ask what stimulus information in the auditory scene is actually encoded, and how does the resolution of this encoding affect auditory scene analysis? The size of the auditory scene, which can be operationally defined as the number of sound sources that a human listener can count, detect, identify, localize, or discriminate between and among, represents a window to answer our research question. We will present stimuli derived from traditional methodologies under dynamic conditions where stimulus information, duration and reverberation are varied, asking listeners to detect if an additional sound source is added to an acoustic mixture. We then analyze listeners behavioral responses using a phenomenological, biologically-inspired model of peripheral and brainstem auditory processing. INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The auditory scene is the brains estimated solution to a difficult inverse problem: the brain must infer what sound sources elicited a highly complex, continuous stream of quickly changing, peripheral neural sensory signals. Using these neural sensory signals and experience, the brain must compute what and where those sources are by creating an internal representation of the outside world, all while the listener and sound sources potentially move, and often in the presence of reverberation. This perceptual auditory scene must be continually updated in order to navigate the auditory environment. Little is known about how this task is accomplished. To investigate how humans navigate an auditory scene by creating a dynamic, spatial, nearly real-time internal representation of the individual sound sources in an auditory scene, this proposal focuses on the logical starting place for this goal, the auditory processing factors that place limits on the size of the auditory scene.BROADER IMPACTS: Technological Impacts: Understanding how the brain maintains (and how AVRtechnology can efficiently render) an immersive, plausible, and responsive representation of the auditoryenvironment is essential if the benefits (communication, education, emotional) of a wide variety oftechnologies (not just virtual realities) are to be accessible as possible in as affordable a way as possible.A great deal of effort has been spent developing hearing aids, cochlear implants, and assisted listening devices to improve performance for listeners with hearing loss in complex auditory scenes, yet many challenges remain. Both the development of diagnostic methods to determine difficulties in processing sound in complex acoustic environments and the development of treatments have and will continue to benefit from many of the outcomes of the past and planned experiments. Knowledge of how the perceived auditory scene is constructed and updated, how technologies might be developed to perform similar tasks, and how different populations accomplish this feat, will be essential to the successful improvement of these communication platforms. Educational Impacts: This work will provide further impact through undergraduate and graduate training opportunities, contributing to the development of a diverse, competitive workforce for auditory research. ASU students are highly encouraged to participate in research during their studies. The speech and hearing program at ASU has a long tradition fostering collaboration between basic science and clinical research and practice. This proposal will offer joint training opportunities for AUD students by offering research electives and independent studies. We also will impact teaching and learning by developing innovative, active learning modules for data analysis in cognitive neuroscience that center around the themes of this proposal.  Modules will focus on understanding basic psychophysical experiments and data analyses based on simulated and published data. Modules will be used in the labs and made available online at various stages of this proposal.",
FP00030121,608,,,,,1,,,"Overview         The research goal of the proposed CAREER project is to examine how adoption of applied data-driven risk assessment tools engenders new forms of collaboration between fire departments and community stakeholders. This project will focus specifically on the implementation of a data-driven community risk insight generator (the CRAIG 1300 system developed by the NFPA) in U.S. fire departments as the use case.  Fire departments, the organizations tasked with handling a multitude of health and safety risks in U.S. communities, are on the precipice of adopting a new generation of IT that will transform risk assessment practices by using aggregated datasets and powerful data analytics to identify and characterize a wide range of community risks. However, data-driven risk assessment necessitates new collaborative multi-organizational relationships centered on producing, interpreting, and making decisions about how to reduce community risks based on risk data. Further, data-driven tools for assessing health and safety risks present potential for increased surveillance and unethical treatment of at-risk populations.      The proposed project seeks to overcome shortcomings of past approaches to implementation and use of data-driven risk IT in other domains by: 1)  partnering with the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) and Fort Worth Fire Department (FWFD) to study the implementation of the CRAIG 1300 system; and 2) employing participatory design methods to co-design IT tools that augment CRAIG 1300 by supporting collaboration between fire departments and community stakeholders. Specifically, the research team will conduct an ethnographic study to uncover risk assessment practices, and opportunities and barriers faced by fire departments in collaborating with community stakeholders to carry out community risk assessments. These stakeholders will include both formal organizational stakeholders and members of at risk populations. The research team will leverage these findings to facilitate a participatory design process that includes at-risk groups. The resulting design will be assessed at the FWFD through a limited field deployment. Students will be trained in human-centered data science, participatory design, and inclusive decision making processes through both coursework and research participation. Intellectual Merit     Many sectors, from healthcare to business to education, are working to develop and implement IT to assess risks upstream, thus preventing problems downstream. The proposed research will produce empirical insights about implementation of data-driven risk assessment IT in fire departments, a domain understudied in human centered computing and other disciplines despite its huge societal importance, while producing insights that inform data-driven risk assessment more broadly. Further, successfully implementing data-driven risk assessment IT without causing negative unintended consequences for workers and communities--particularly systematically marginalized communities--is a persistent challenge. This project will tackle this challenge by extending sociotechnical theories on how data-driven practices for handling risks reconfigure risk knowledge and accountability, and extending human centered data science methodologies by bridging participatory design and inclusive public engagement, reimaging data-driven community risk assessment as an inclusive process. Broader Impact     The proposed research will improve the health and well-being of communities by examining the effects of implementing CRAIG 1300, insights that will be communicated to the NFPA to further refine the tool and support implementation and effective use of the system. Further, designing a tool to support collaborative data-driven community risk assessment with community stakeholders will increase the effectiveness and equity of data-driven risk assessment processes used by fire departments. Outreach activities to fire departments and advocacy organizations serving at-risk populations will provide training to fire departments in engaging community stakeholders in data-driven processes and education to community members about evolving community risk assessment practices. By engaging diverse students in research via research mentorship, course projects, and development of a new project-based course, this work will recruit and train the next generation of researchers and practitioners in human-centered data science.",

FP00030200,613,,,,,1,,," STATEMENT OF WORK  As a component of the Data and Research Core (DRC) our team aims to pursue multiple activities to support the goals of AIM-AHEAD. In particular, we aim to be one of test beds in developing use cases and using various techniques and algorithms in the fast-moving AI/ML sphere, as relevant to the health domain. In that a key focus of ours would be on issues related to the currently underrepresented population. This would include  research  on  recognizing  bias  in  AI/ML  systems  and  developing  ways  to  overcome  them,  and research on social determinants of health. We aim to help the Data Science Training Core in identifying important AI/ML issues and topics, especially the latest ones, that needs to be covered in the training; and providing  them  with  preliminary  results.  We  will  make  special  effort  to  involve  members  of  the underrepresented population in our research and seek out collaboration with the consortium members in our research and data collection efforts. Based on our research experience, we aim to provide input to the infrastructure team regarding the infrastructure needs when working on AI/ML methods with respect to the health domain.   With Data and Research focus, we will study various aspects of AI/ML ready data, especially as it pertains to health and health equity. This includes (a) understanding of AI/ML data, with particular focus on  bias in AI/ML Systems, their sources and how to mitigate them; (b) preparing diverse and multi-modal data; (c) Data analysis for determining the effects of social determinants of health; (d) studying data aggregation and data  enhancement  techniques,  such  as  synthetic  data  creation;  (e)  Multi-modal  data  fusion  and  user modeling  for  personalized  health  and  well-being;  and  (f)  dealing  with  textual  data  in  EHR,  especially addressing information retrieval, extraction and reasoning. We now elaborate on these issues and mention our teams expertise in pursuing them.  Bias  in  AI/ML  Systems:  anecdotes,  sources  of  bias,  and  how  to  mitigate  them:    Many  ML  and  AI systems  have  been  found  to  contain  bias  in  that  their  results  occasionally  (or  perhaps  often)  reflect prejudice. For example, word embeddings used in many ML based NLP applications captured the obviously prejudiced  relationship:   Computer-programmer    Man  +  Woman  =  Home-Maker;  an  early  version  of Amazon's recruiting tool penalized CVs that had the use of women's in them;  COMPAS, an AI system used in US court systems was biased against black offenders; a CMU study found that  women were shown significantly fewer online ads for high-paying jobs than men were; and Microsofts teen slang Twitter bot was taken down after producing racist posts.  A big portion of the bias in ML and AI systems can be attributed to the data that is used in training those systems. These data related biases are of various kinds, such as: Sample bias/ Selection Bias/Background Bias, Prejudice Bias /Association Bias, Perceptive Bias, Outcome Bias, Exclusion Bias, Measurement bias, Bandwagoning  or  bandwagon  effect,  and  Availability  Bias.  Some  of  the  non-data  related  biases  are: Algorithm bias, Anchoring bias, and Confirmation bias/Observer Bias.  To  overcome  and  reduce  bias  an  organization  needs  to  take  a  multi-step  approach:  (i)  First  it  needs  to identify possible sources of bias and set up guidelines and rules to eliminate/reduce bias.  For example, data annotation is often a source bias which can be overcome by multi-pass annotation.  (ii) Since a lot of the bias  emanates  from  the  data,  models  and  learning  algorithms  used,  various  techniques  can  be  used in selecting and cleaning that data and using appropriate training methods. This includes anonymization of data, use of explainable models to the extent possible, and use of adversarial learning. (iii) The organization should  document the  methods  (such as the  above)  that  are  used in  data selection  and  cleaning.  (iv)  For evaluating models criteria beyond performance, such as a bias measure needs to be used. (v) Finally, the AI models need to be monitored, tested, and evaluated regularly. This could include formal audits. Some of the tools and techniques that could be helpful in this include: Googles What-If tool, AI Fairness 360 toolkit from IBM, Subpopulation Analysis, and DebiasML (a novel application of oversampling). As part of the proposed research, we plan to study biases in ML/AI systems used in healthcare and propose ways to overcome them and verify the hypothesis regarding our proposed approaches.    Preparing  diverse  and  multi-modal  data:  A  successful  transition  from  paper-based  information repositories to Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems entails careful coordination between a plethora of moving  modules.  A  myriad  of  complex  issues,  ranging  from  technical,  procedural to  ethical  challenges must  be  addressed  and  made  to  comply  with  the  acceptable  standards  and  information  security.  The technical  considerations  and  decisions  that  are  often  encountered  for  an  effective  migration  from  paper documents to electronic formats are: (i) Identifying different modalities of data associated with a patient record; (ii) Filtering out a selected set of attributes that needs to be extracted from the clinical data pool of a patient; (iii) Designing and developing state-of-the-art strategies for seamlessly converting information to  an  electronic  form;    (iv)  Incorporating  fault-tolerant  mechanisms  to  prevent  information  loss;  (v) Designing techniques to evaluate the efficacy of converted data and that the information is of sufficient quality; (vi) Developing a strategy to access and store classified data for processing that meets the security and privacy requirements; and (vii) Designing scalable systems that can handle multiple concurrent requests to the system. Our  team  of  researchers  and  developers  have  expertise  in  designing  and  building  robust,  cloud-based machine-learning  software solutions  which can  seamlessly  integrate  with  EHR  systems.  These  products provide solutions to alleviate the labor-intensive process of manual patient information entry, mapping, and transfer by streamlining the automatic extraction of relevant information from structured and unstructured offline patient data (such as files of patient health insurance claim forms, medical billing records, image invoices sent through fax machines, etc.) using state-of-the-art natural-language-processing and computer vision models.   The core part of the system (Information Extraction Engine, as depicted above recognizes texts from images and groups them into semantic entities for rendering them at a later stage in a structured query-value format. This  is  achieved  by  deploying  character-based  language  modelling,  inception  style/transformer-based optical  machine  learning models  and  custom  decoding  algorithms  across a  delineated set  of  operations, namely: (a) document modality detection: examining and identifying different modal classes (image/text) existing  in  the  document,  (b)  image  quality  enhancement:  strategically  modifying  image  parameters  to circumvent  the  issues  of  missing  information  due  to  occlusion,  superimposition,  low  contrast,  etc.,  (c) document  alignment:  modifying  layout  orientations  of  tilted/deformed  documents  sent  through  fax machines,  scanning  devices,  etc.,  (d)  document  type  classification:  identifying  document  class  (health insurance form,  billing  records,  etc.)  to  narrow  down  the  search to  a  restricted set  of  keys,  (e)  template generation:  initializing  the  list  of  keys  and  template  layout  parameters  for  entity  extraction  at  different geometric scales, (f) entity detection: identification and extraction of atomic entity blobs in the document that  are  structurally  coherent,  (g)  entity  direction  identification:  detecting  the  orientation  of  entities  for better  extraction  of  texts,  (h)  artifact  elimination:  eliminating  redundant/superfluous  entities  which  are irrelevant to the task at hand, (i) text recognition: identifying script language and text from entities and clubbing  them  into  meaningful  tokens,  (j)  entity  clubbing:  clubbing  extracted  tokens  into  meaningful entities,  based  on  context-dependent  language  semantics,  (k)  entity-template  mapping:  identifying  key items  present  in  the  entities  and  mapping  them  to the  keys  in  the initialized  template  list,  (l)  extraction scrutinization: inspection of extracted items using error-checking mechanisms, by flagging the entities with low confidence scores for additional verifications, and (m) information integration across-records: running modules to integrate multi-modal data extracted from different records of a patient. The information, thus obtained, is stored in the form of key-value pairs and tables to ensure convenient access and transfer across different EHR systems.   Citing the HIPAA compliance agreements, a cloud-based server is configured to house the proposed engine and  can  only  be  accessed  through  secured  portals,  with  proper  authorization  credentials.  The  system seamlessly  performs  the  following  functionalities,  when  given  access  to  patient  records:  (i)  Provides  a multi-modal  information  procurement  architecture;  (ii)  Extracts  structured  information  from  a  wide spectrum of document types and qualities, using state-of-the-art machine learning models and optimizes data  extraction  workflow;  (iii)  Establishes  a  fault-tolerant  environment  by  performing  routine documentation checks and flagging errors for easy verification; (iv) Automatically maintains proper data organization to meet requirements and facilitate access and retrieval of extracted information; (v) Reduces the  risk  of  combining  redundant  entries  of  records  at  a  member-level;  and  (vi)  Access  and  transfer  of information in compliance with security and privacy requirements.  Data analysis for determining the effects of social determinants of health: Determining the effects of social determinants of health from clinical data necessitates substantial multimodal data analysis. Our team of researchers have expertise in working over a broad spectrum of problem statements which encompass examination over multimodal health-care data for analyzing the contributing factors of a social issue. We have made efforts to bring recent advances in data analytics techniques to alleviate the impact of the opioid epidemic. In particular, we attempted to provide answers to the following questions: Is there a correlation between the prescribers, prescriptions and opioid-related deaths in U.S. states?    Which prescribers are likely to prescribe more than 10 Opioid related prescriptions in a year?    Is there a correlation between the income level and Opioid related incidences, in a neighborhood? Is there a correlation between the age and Opioid related incidences, in a neighborhood? Is there a correlation between the education level and Opioid related incidences, in a neighborhood?  We have developed a novel deep neural architecture for predicting the Opioid heat maps for the future. We model the given problem as a supervised learning task: given a sequence of Opioid Incidence Locations + Location characteristics (Median household income in the location, demographic Profile based on Ethnicity of the location, at the county level of Opioid Overdose Incidents, over a time horizon of N consecutive days) we predicted Locations (county level) of the Opioid Overdose Incidences on the (N + 1)th time-units.  Studying data aggregation and data enhancement techniques, such as synthetic data creation: When building ML/AI systems where the systems are trained on data, one must not lose track that the goal is to address a task, and the training data is just a means. With that in mind when trying to develop models with good  characteristics,  which  goes  beyond  performance  on  test  sets  to  characteristics  such  as  robustness, generalizability and bias minimization, a common technique that is used is data augmentation. One kind of data augmentation is synthetic    data creations. The PI Baral and his student have extensively used data augmentation and synthetic data creation [CB1-CB5] with respect to various natural language processing and computer vision/image processing tasks.   in and text) various In the health domain there are additional reasons, such as privacy preservation, to create and use synthetic data. In recent weeks there has been news of synthetic health data creation and use by the Israeli company MDClone. The basic approach in creating synthetic health data is to use the given data to learn patterns and then generate synthetic data that confirm with those patterns. The generated synthetic data is now expected to serve the same purpose as the original data, except that there is no longer the issue of privacy.  In addition the synthetic data creation princess can be steered to avoid bias. A particular implementation of this is based on  GAN  (Generative  Adversarial  Networks)  which  have  been  shown  to  create  realistic  output  (such  as images site https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/  generates  realistic  images  of  people  that  do  not  exist.  The  paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11774 presents such a method to create synthetic medical data.   Although GANs have been widely used in various domains, its use in synthetic data creation in the medical domain is new; and in general creation of synthetic data in the medical domain is  somewhat new. Thus further detailed study of the properties of the synthetic data is needed. As part of this project, we plan to develop various methods of creating synthetic data and study their properties. As a preliminary work, PI Sens team have created synthetic data to test out the efficacy of their Opioid Incidence Prediction Engine. Synthetic data is created with local (Arizona) characteristics as much as possible so as to make it as realistic as possible. This is accomplished by using demographic data pertaining to Arizona that is available in the public domain.  the  GAN domains. example, powered For Multi-modal data fusion and user modeling for personalized health and well-being:  The abundance of clinical data acquired in professional settings and personal health data acquired through smart health devices have provided us with the unique opportunities in building solutions for promoting, achieving and maintaining personalized health and wellbeing. While the potential benefits are huge, personalization is challenging: despite the rich availability of health-related data (acquired both in the clinical setting and via smart health devices), lacking are systematic approaches to integration of such potentially complementary, multi-modal  data  sources  for  inferring  user-specific  health  information.  In  particular,  the  diverse  data sources pose practical variability challenges for inference tasks: (1) inter-subject variations (each individual has physiological differences) and intra-subject variations (individuals have varying activities/behaviors); (2)  variability  in  temporal  scales  (e.g.,  heartbeat  vs  dietary  behaviors);  (3)  variability  in  data  types (physiological data vs genetics). We  aim to  develop  AI/ML  models  for  overcoming  the  above  challenges  in  data  fusion  and  temporal modeling, hence providing enabling capabilities for the development of solutions for personalized health and wellbeing. The effort has two innovations. First, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework to support feature mining where unifying feature representations from multimodal data are generated through a  deep-learning-based  embedding  framework.  Second,  we  propose  to  develop  novel  temporal  inference models for associating data with other internal/external factors reflecting a users health status. Together, our  modeling  techniques  enable  learning  from  multimodal  and  multi-scale  data,  while  supporting personalized inference. In contrast to most existing state-space models that require explicit specification of the states, which is unrealistic to do (as it is unknown how many health states are there, and what they are), our  approach  employ  a  semi-supervised  Bayesian  approach.  This  data-driven  approach  effectively untangles  complex relationship between the  measured  data  and  the  underlying  latent  states defining  the health status of the subject to learn a prediction model without requirement much prior knowledge. We plan to pursue two approaches as described below.   (a) Learning unified feature representations from time series using multi-task learning and neural embedding: The complexity of association between health and measurable data streams renders it unlikely to rely on any single data source alone. Further, the data streams are diverse in nature (e.g., heartbeat rate can be continuously measured while the medicine intake may occur sporadically) and they carry different amounts of information relevant to our task. Therefore, proper feature mining techniques are critical to any inference task relying on such data. Our chief strategy for addressing these practical challenges is to use representation learning for developing a feature-embedding approach that fuse multi-channel data (in terms of segments of interest) into unified representations for subsequent inference tasks. This is schematically illustrated next.   Illustrating the embedding idea: Fi() are feature extractors; LSTM encoding is used to capture the temporal dynamics of the data/features; Labels or descriptive info are used for regularizing the neural coding and decoding in learning the embedding space where the new feature representations reside. The illustration also indication feature fusion (i.e., fewer channels in the embedding space).  (b) Semi-supervised learning for modeling for personalized health: Many factors contribute to variation in bodily responses to medicine or other interventions like physical activity, leading the rich variability of measured data as discussed previously. Therefore, a typical classification model operating in a vector space of the measurements/features (e.g., trying to classify a user into a few predefined categories based on his/her personal data) would not be adequate for our supporting personalized health. To this end, we propose to use hierarchical Bayesian modeling together with multi-rate hidden Markov models as the primary vehicle in building our temporal modeling approach. The key innovation lies in the capability for handling multi-scale multi-modality data and the semi-supervised approach to discovering generative models that can both capture population property and enable individualized assessment. This vision is solidly based on a related effort in our prior work on modeling another complex temporal phenomenon, motion expertise in surgery. We set out to computationally model the association between a users health status and all streams of data measuring  his/her  internal  and  external  factors.  Intuitively,  if  it  is  known  that  the  measurements  are adequate  for  characterizing  the  health  status,  we  may  employ  some  regression  model,  such  as  a  linear model, for parametrizing the association. However, such a simple approach is unlikely to serve our purpose. For example, if the raw measurements are of high-dimensional (as they will usually be, especially for raw time series data), with only a small number of training data, the problem is heavily under-constrained. Also, as  he  data  streams  are  in  general  time-varying  signals,  viewing  them  as  a  single  aggregated  vector  for learning a linear model leaves little room for modeling such temporal dynamics. Further, the data streams may present at very different time scales. Last but not least, a regression-based model works effectively only with labelled data but cannot be applied to analyze large-scale unlabeled data of many users. We now detail our approach for addressing these practical challenges. Three  key  points  of  our  approach  are  (1)  to  employ  hidden  Markov  models  (HMMs)  for  modeling  the temporal dynamics of a users health status by the hidden states of the HMM (with the HMM observations corresponding to the measurements), (2) to impose a hierarchical Bayesian structure on the HMM, and (3) to incorporate the multi-rate HMM framework for explicitly modeling the disparate time scales of different modalities.  In  implementation,  we  will  utilize  HDP-HMM  (hierarchical  Dirichlet  process  HMM)  in building  the  baseline  model,  which  supports  both  supervised  and  unsupervised  processing.  Although  in principle such a model allows multiple hierarchies, we plan to use only a three-layer structure to illustrate the key research tasks below.  Dealing  with  textual  data  in  EHR,  especially  addressing  information  retrieval  and  extraction:  Besides structured data EHR has various other kinds of data, often in pdf files. In this section we will focus on dealing with text data either directly accessible in the EHR or in the pdf files of the EHR.  Retrieving relevant information from biomedical text data is a new challenging area of research. To extract needed information, we first need to identify the particular document or even a particular paragraph inside the  document  where  the  needed  information  may  be  present.  For  that,  we  need  to  use  an  Information Retrieval (IR) module. Several basic IR systems and wrappers around them are freely available and can be adapted  to  various  needs.  In  recent  years,  various  traditional  IR  models  have  been  introduced  for  the biomedical document ranking, and achieve some good results [M1].  Information Retrieval: A Health and Biomedical Perspective provides basic theory, implementation and evaluation of IR systems in health and biomedicine [M2]. In a Biomedical IR, the type of information generated or stored is patient-specific or knowledge-based,  where  the  knowledge-based  is  majorly  used  for  research  purposes  and  is  used  by healthcare  practitioners  and  biomedical  researchers.  Many  Search  Engines  are  available  which  use biomedical IR systems on the web nowadays which cover large information, some of them are PubMed which uses MeSH (Medical subject text heading) for query processing [M3]. The major focus of an IR system is to search for what the user queries for. The below Figure shows the schematic representation of the biomedical IR system for retrieving medical documents.  In the past decades, many attempts have been made to adopt IR techniques in the medical field for document or passage retrieval. As shown in Figure, there are two main conceptual or data-related processes in the creation and accessing of IR systems: indexing and ranking. For indexing in biomedical IR, the commonly used  techniques  are  Indri,  Lucene  or  Terrier-based  indexing  depending  on  applications  [M7,  M8].  For ranking in biomedical IR, the conventional vector space models are used in many biomedical IR [M6, M7]. Apart from that, traditional IR such as probabilistic knowledge retriever BM25 [M4], Anserini [M5], and many Language Models (LM) are used for efficient document or passage retrieval in biomedical IR. Unlike traditional IR, biomedical IR faces some domain-specific challenges due to the abundance of terminologies. Different articles use different types of terminologies to describe the same concept.    Figure: Schematic representation of Medical Information Retrieval System. The oval represents the processing step. The rectangle represents a collection or database. Adapted from [M7].  Zhou et al. [M9] have shown the importance of incorporating domain-specific knowledge (e.g., information about concepts and relationships between concepts) in an IR system in order to improve its effectiveness in retrieving biomedical passages. With the advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP), the release of  BERT  (Bidirectional  Encoder  Representations  from  Transformers),  i.e.,  Masked  LM,  [M10]  had significantly impacted the IR field. Similarly, some widely-used pretrained and fine-tuned variants of BERT are for the biomedical domain such as BioBERT [M11] and NCBI BlueBERT [M12] have impacted the biomedical IR. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [M13] proposed BioMedBERT for biomedical IR. Our recent work [M18] also analyzed the effectiveness of BERT-based models for unsupervised document retrieval for identifying articles related to therapeutics and vaccines for COVID. We can leverage the strength of advanced indexing and ranking models in order to achieve efficient retrieval of relevant EHR or relevant passage from EHR with needed information. Apart from this, various novel IR techniques are emerging such  as  the  rule-exemplar  method  [M14],  semantic  information-based  retrieval  [M15],  neural  ranking models like SPARTA [M16], Question-Answering (QA) based retrieval [M17], and more. We can explore these new ideas and apply them for our biomedical document or passage retrieval task.  Once the paragraphs are identified, having a thorough understanding of each paragraph is essential. This helps  in  further  downstream  tasks  like  information  extraction,  question  answering,  paragraph summarization etc. For each of these tasks, extraction of specific contents are crucial.   Entity extraction and Named Entity Recognition:  Entity extraction and named entity recognition over the years have progressed from using template-based string matching methods to hand-crafted features to neural end-to-end methods. Multiple categories of named-entities have been identified like (a) flat (entities do not overlap) (b) nested (entities overlap) (c) discontinuous (parts of the same entity are separated by non-entities).  There are four major neural approaches : (a) Token Sequence-labeling : In this approach, each token is classified as B-{entity_type} (begin of entity), I-{entity_type} (entity continuing) and O (others). This conventional approach for NER fails to correctly predict discontinuous and nested named entities. (b)  Span-prediction  :  A relatively  newer  approach  is to  find the span of the entities  in  a text  instead  of classifying  each  token  {K4}.  This  helps  solve  the  issue  of  nested  NER  but  has  trouble  identifying discontinuous entities because of the task design. (c) Question-Answering : Here specific questions (in template form) regarding each entity type are asked to the model and it should be able to return the entities in the form of spans. {K1} (d) Text Generation : Recently, generative methods have been able to identify all 3 types of NERs using BART via training with strings of entity along with its types {K2} or using templates {K3} (e) Rule/Template-based : These methods use hand-crafted rules in the form of regular expressions {K5} or constantly generating complex rules from simple ones using logical connectives {K6}. These approaches help in unsupervised NER via weakly supervised learning.  Our work  {K1} studied the NER task extensively using 18 biomedical datasets . We were able to achieve state-of-the-art  performance  in  11  of  them  using  a  combination  of  multiple  knowledge  contexts  and question answering methods. We used three types of external knowledge contexts like definition, examples and entity-type and show empirically that a combination of all of them is important to achieve the SOTA performance.   Relation/Event-Argument Extraction: Once the entities are extracted and identified, the next step is to find relations between them. This is the essence of natural language understanding. This relation can be  roles played by the entity and are often binary in nature {K8}. Apart from that, all biomedical texts have events (often identified by verbs) which drive the intent of a paragraph. To understand the paragraph it is of utmost importance that one is able to identify the event (simple) or understand the connective statements supporting the salient events {K7}. Often events are associated with event arguments like who, when, what, where etc which enriches an event. Extraction and normalization of event-arguments is also an important task.  Currently, most of the advancements in the area of relation/event extraction and benchmarks are on intra-sentence extraction. But this is not often the case in real life medical documents like EHR. So we are starting to  focus  more  towards  inter-statement  or  even  inter-paragraph  relation/event  extraction.  A  possible approach can be event-argument graph generation from free-form texts and using the graph-based neural network  to  reason  about  the  causality  and  temporal  relationship  between  components  of  an  event.  For Relation extraction, we can use Natural language inference(NLI) for each pair of entities to check whether a particular relation between them is entailed by the given text.     ",

FP00030300,615,,,,,1,,,"High throughput immunoproteomics for cancer biomarker discovery  Project Summary/Abstract The goal of the ASU Biomarker Characterization Center is to improve the morbidity of ovarian and lung cancer screening  through  the  development  of  biologically-relevant  circulating  immune  biomarkers.  The  scientific approach of our Center is based on several fundamental principles.  First, that altered cancer protein expression, structure,  and  post-translational  modifications  induce  host  autoantibodies  to  create  circulating  biomarkers. Second,  that  alterations  in  microbial  antigen  expression  (such  as  respiratory fungal  pathogens)  also  induce immunity, often detected in benign rather than malignant disease. Third, that the protein modifications, as well as  the  immune  response  to  these  neoantigenic  structures,  are  heterogeneous  between  people,  and  that serologic  biomarkers  may  complement  circulating  protein  biomarkers.    We  will  take  a  systems  immunology approach  to  discover  three  types  of  antibodies,  anti-microbial  antibodies,  autoantibodies  and  anti-aberrant glycoprotein antibodies. Our proposal builds on our extensive experiences with cancer biomarker discovery and immunoproteomics  technology  development.  Our  previous  results  on  autoantibody  biomarkers  have  been confirmed in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies and led to a CLIA-certified commercial blood test. Our results have shown that multiplexed panels of autoantibodies are required for adequate predictive value.  With prior EDRN support, we have developed a set of innovative immunoproteomics technologies, namely high-density  nucleic  acid  programmable  protein  array  (HD-NAPPA),  contra-capture  protein  array  (CCPA)  and multiplexed in solution protein array (MISPA), that, together with the largest full-length human and microbial gene collection at our DNASU plasmid repository, enable us to study antibodies against the full human proteome, microbial proteomes and the human O-glycoproteome for antibody biomarker signatures in cancer. We will use the Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) MultiArray platform to migrate the top serologic and protein markers for their utility in our target clinical applications to complement our antibody markers. We will collaborate with experts on lung and ovarian cancer screening at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Boston University, MD Anderson Cancer  Center,  and  German  Cancer  Research  Center,  who  will  also  provide  access  to  high-quality  well-characterized samples to develop circulating biomarkers to enhance ovarian cancer screening or to distinguish benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will perform Phase I discovery  by  screening  protein  arrays  with  cancer  patient  and  control  sera  for  cancer  or  control-specific antibodies. Candidate biomarkers for both lung and ovarian cancers will undergo Phase 2 validation.  Project Narrative  We hypothesize that circulating antibodies can be measured as specific biomarkers of lung and ovarian cancers. We will state of the art immune profiling to discover, and validate, select protein and immune biomarkers for lung and ovarian cancer.   SPECIFIC AIMS: Despite advances in screening and treatment, mortalities from ovarian and lung cancers have remained high in the US over the last 20 years. It is widely accepted that early detection is critical to improving outcomes in both diseases. However, current cancer detection with imaging has limitations, and a significant number of these cancers are diagnosed in late stages based on symptoms.  Our long-term goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality from ovarian and lung cancers through more effective early detection. The goal of this proposal is to identify novel serum immune responses to aberrant proteins, glycoproteins and microbial antigens. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant protein structures, whether  derived  from  self-antigens  or  from  altered  microbial  environments,  induce  specific  serum antibody biomarkers that distinguish cancer from benign disease.  Although some clinical adoption has started,  several  roadblocks  have  prevented  the  wide  identification  and  clinical  implementation  of  these biomarkers.  First, we need efficient methods to display the wide variety of immunogenic structural proteins and glycoproteins for biomarker discovery.  Second, while the immune response to altered tumor antigens can be highly specific, reproducible, and detectable prior to clinical diagnosis, individual biomarkers lack the sensitivity for cancer screening. The best diagnostics require multiple antigenic panels (to capture the underlying tumor and microenvironmental heterogeneity), combined with sandwich immunoassays for circulating polypeptides, which often have higher sensitivity but limited specificity. Finally, skill for protein production at scale is required for efficient migration of lab-based multiplexed immune-assays for clinical use. Here, we address all three of these challenges, using advances in proteomics, high-throughput immune profiling, and serologic expertise to address the need for circulating biomarkers for lung and ovarian cancers. With prior EDRN support, we developed high-throughput programmable protein display methods for the rapid  detection  and  validation  of  autoantibody  (AAb)  and  anti-glycoprotein  autoantibody  (AGPA)  biomarker signatures in cancer.  Our results, which have been confirmed in blinded phase II multicenter validation studies, have  led  to  ongoing  commercial  development  of  our  breast,  ovarian,  and  HPV-associated  biomarkers.  Our results showed that immune signatures based on fundamental mechanisms of carcinogenesis (such as mutation or  alterations  in  glycosylation)  are  reproducible  and  highly  specific,  but  multiplexed  panels  are  required  for adequate  predictive  value.  However,  our  data  indicate  that  a  significant  number  of  immunogenic  structural epitopes remain undetected due to technical issues limiting efficient protein display.  In lung cancer, for example, our data suggest that circulating anti-microbial IgG biomarkers improve the identification of benign lung nodules, while tumor antigen-specific IgG biomarkers are associated with tumor nodules. Here we propose to use state-of-the art protein and glycoprotein display to systematically display full-length proteins (self and microbial), as well as proteins decorated with glycans based on predicted alterations in glycosyltransferases in cancer.  This will revolutionize the opportunity to screen immunogenic epitopes in their more natural context.  As  a  Biomarker  Characterization  Center (BCC), we  propose  an  integrated  pipeline  to  discover  and  validate immunogenic  B-  cell  epitopes  as  biomarkers  in  cancer  patients.  This  is  based  on  a  combination  of  high-throughput proteomic screening in our Biomarker Discovery Laboratory (BDL) at the Biodesign Institute at ASU, and  migration  of  assays  to  a  clinical  platform  at  the  Biomarker  Reference  Laboratory  (BRL)  at  Meso-Scale Diagnostics.  The end result will be two-fold: first, rapid identification of serologic and protein biomarkers that are specific for cancer, and second, an understanding of the mechanisms of protective immunity that will guide future cancer vaccine design and monitoring.   The Overall Specific Aims of the ASU BCC are to:  1. 2. 3. Discover and validate the immune profiles specific for altered protein and glycosylated proteins for early detection in ovarian cancer. This will leverage advances from our current BDL.  Determine  protein,  glycoprotein  and  microbial  targets  of  B  cell  immunity  in  lung  cancer  and demonstrate the ability of these biomarkers to distinguish cancer from benign pulmonary nodules. This will leverage recent advances from our team for high-throughput serologic screening.  Migrate biomarker assays to a multiplexed ELISA format using the Meso-Scale Diagnostics clinical platform and determine complementarity of these biomarkers with circulating proteins.   These studies will permit our Center to collaborate rapidly with Clinical Validation Centers within the EDRN for validation studies in lung and ovarian cancer.   for The ASU Figure A.1. Biomarker classes to be evaluated by the ASU BCC. Research Strategy A.  Scientific  Rationale  and  BCC  Product Biomarker Development. Characterization  Center  is  focused  on  the discovery (PRoBE phase 0-1), assay selection and migration to a CLIA-compatible format, and validation  (PROBE  phase  2)  of  circulating immune  and  protein  biomarkers the detection of lung and ovarian cancers.  The ASU BCC harnesses unique technologies in protein display  and  immune  profiling  to  cover  four different classes of biomarkers (antibodies to self-protein  antigens,  glycoprotein  antigens, microbial  antigens)  as  well  as  synergy  with existing protein biomarkers (Fig. A.1). These biomarkers reflect the underlying biology that drives altered protein and glycoprotein signatures in solid tumors.  Here, we propose to develop these biomarkers to solve two unmet needs in clinical care: 1) improving the selection of women for transvaginal ultrasound for ovarian cancer (OC) screening and 2) improving the selection of patients with indeterminate lung nodules for biopsy of lung cancer (LC).  We choose these two clinical targets in part due to our track record and success in the identification of both  ovarian  cancer  and  lung  cancer  immune  biomarkers,  for  which  we  have  biomarkers  ready  for  assay migration, and for which there is a clear clinical need for additional biomarker discovery.   A.1. The clinical need for circulating biomarkers for ovarian cancer detection  It is estimated that over 20,000 women will be diagnosed with and 14,000 women will die of cancer of ovarian cancer each year (3).  Ovarian cancer, in particular serous ovarian cancer (SOC), has a high mortality rate, due in part to late detection.  Between 2000-2010, 60% of ovarian cancer cases were  diagnosed  at  the  distant/advanced stage  (3).  The  5-year  survival  rate  for ovarian cancer is only 27% for women with late-stage/metastatic disease (3). However, if discovered early, 5-year survival is between 72% (regional disease) and 92% (local disease). As a result, there are large multicenter and multinational efforts to improve screening of ovarian cancer. The goal of screening for ovarian cancer is to detect disease at early stages where complete resection is feasible. The low prevalence of ovarian cancer (1:2500 in the postmenopausal setting) requires biomarkers with high specificity. To reach a positive predictive value (PPV)>10% (no more than 10 operations for each case detected), this  requires  a  combined  biomarker  sensitivity  of  >75%  and  a  specificity  over  99%!  Current  strategies  for epithelial  ovarian  cancer  (EOC)  screening  use  a  combination  of  circulating  biomarkers  and  trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVUS) imaging(4, 5). However, in randomized trials the combination of TVUS and CA125the best available biomarker for EOCprovided either no mortality reduction (PLCO study, USA) [1], or only a small and marginally significant reduction when longitudinal changes in CA125 were considered (UKCTOCS, UK) [2]. In prospective cohort studies, we [3, 4] and others have observed that CA125 or HE4 detect EOC only a relatively short time (6 months) prior to diagnosis and at advanced stages. CA125 and HE4 can be increased in benign gynecologic conditions or non-gynecologic malignancies. These observations justify the continued search for alternative biomarkers, to be used in conjunction with imaging.  Currently, detection of ovarian cancer relies on clinical signs and symptoms, followed by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for symptomatic patients(4, 5).  There is no standard annual screening technique for asymptomatic women, as is the case with breast cancer and mammography.  Serum CA-125 and HE4, two serum protein biomarkers, are routinely used for monitoring patients with ovarian cancer who are at risk for recurrence (6).  However, the utility of CA 125 as a screening test is limited by a low sensitivity of 50-60% for early stage disease at 99% specificity (7).  Combining CA 125 with TVUS increased the specificity of detection in the UKCTOCS large-scale screening trial (8) and has been developed into screening algorithms (9).  In a joint validation study Figure A.2. Intended clinical use of ASU ovarian cancer biomarkers.   of 28 potential markers for detecting ovarian cancer in blood (10, 11), the most accurate marker remains CA 125, followed closely by HE4 (12) (13).   A.1.1.  Prior  results  in  ovarian  cancer.  We  have  conducted  a  series  of PRoBE  phase  0-II  studies  to  identify circulating TAAb for ovarian cancer detection. Our lead autoantigens include TP53, CTAG1A and CTAG2, and can  be  detected  over  6  months  prior  to  clinical  diagnosis  [REF  Kaaks].  In  an  EDRN  consortium  study  with investigators at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, and the Massachusetts General Hospital, we evaluated 952 blinded  sera collected from 502 healthy women, 200 women with benign pelvic masses,  and  64  early  (I-II)  and  186  late  (III-IV)  stage  ovarian  cancers  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  Data  were analyzed at MGH. A direct comparison of 5 anti-TP53 autoantibody assays and found the ASU RAPID-ELISA assay (using in vitro expressed protein) was the most sensitive. 18 different biomarkers from multiple sites were tested against a standard panel of 952 sera to identify AAb; of these, the custom ASU assays that detection AAb against TP53, CTAG1, CTAG2, were 3 of the 4 biomarkers detected in early stage disease and that complement CA125.  As  a  result,  these  are  our  lead  ovarian  cancer  biomarkers  for  migration  to  the  BRL  for  assay development. These data support the strategy for ongoing discovery of immune biomarkers to improve sensitivity of detection, in particular for early stage, and CA125-negative ovarian cancer cases. A.2. The clinical need for circulating biomarkers for lung cancer detection In  2021,  an  estimated  235,760  Americans will be diagnosed with LC, and 131,880 will die. The overall 5-year survival from LC is only  19%  (1),  with  a  survival  of  57%  for localized LC, decreasing to 5% for stage IV LC. CT screening can detect LC early and reduce  mortality  (2);  however,  the  false-positive  rate is  96%  among  screened individuals with lung nodules. We are facing an  epidemic  of  indeterminate  pulmonary nodules  (IPNs),  not  only found through the proliferation of CT screening programs targeting high-risk individuals for lung cancer following the encouraging results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), but also incidentally found by CT imaging for other clinical reasons. There are unmet needs for circulating biochemical markers that improve the specificity of CT screening (Fig. A.3) and guide decisions about the management of lung nodules (surgical biopsy vs. repeat CT follow up vs. surgical resection) in this clinical setting.   We propose a systematic discovery approach to identify IgG and IgM-based circulating immune profiles that distinguish benign from malignant pulmonary nodules, based on the underlying biologic differences of these nodules. In preliminary studies, we previously identified 5 autoantigens (KRT8, TTC14, KLF8, BRAF, and TLK1) with individual sensitivities ranging from 6.4-8.6% at 98% specificity, that distinguish lung cancer from benign lung  nodules.  Their  performance  in  a  panel  has  not  yet  been  assessed,  and  a  large,  systematic  discovery approach has not been performed. Second, lung cancer is associated with altered glycosylation (see below) which is highly immunogenic.  We propose to discover immune profiles that distinguish altered glycoprotein antigens.  Third, the largest distinction to make is between lung cancer and infectious granulomatous disease. Active fungal disease represents 41% of the benign nodules identified in the Vanderbilt Lung Cancer cohort. Of these,  infection  with  Histoplasma  represents  over  half  of  the  active  infections.  Because  fungal  pulmonary infections  are related to  the  US  location,  we  predict that  a  similar  study  of  benign  nodules  in  the  American Southwest would include a significant proportion of Coccidioides pulmonary infections. For both of these fungi, current serologic measurements of active infection and/or active immunity are insufficiently sensitive and specific to  improve  the  classification  of  benign  nodules.    We  hypothesize  that  improved  detection  of  infection  with Histoplasma and Coccidioides, and a systematic analysis of pathogen-specific immunity, would add value to the serum proteomic signature. We will work with our collaborators at Boston University and at Vanderbilt University to  integrate  these  biomarkers  with  clinical  characteristics  and,  ultimately,  with  quantitative  CT  analyses  to improve the discrimination of benign from malignant pulmonary nodules.   A.3. The immune system and cancer development Figure A.3. Intended clinical use of ASU lung cancer biomarkers. those There  is  an  emerging  appreciation  of  the  critical  role  of  immune  regulation  in  lung  and  ovarian  cancer development.    The  success  of  cancer  immunotherapies  in  recent  years  underscores  the  complex  biologic function of tumor immunity, ranging from tumor control of adaptive immunity to tumorigenic chronic inflammation. Multiple studies have confirmed the prognostic value of tissue-based immune biomarkers for both diseases (14, 15) and our data have demonstrated the diagnostic significance of autoantibody biomarkers in breast and ovarian cancers (16-18), However, the breadth and antigenic specificity of the immune response to cancer remains largely unknown due to the technical limitations of immune profiling across the diversity of the cancer antigen-ome. Our proposed study focuses on the differential humoral immune response in cancer patients and non-cancer subjects and aims to identify antibody markers for the early detection of lung and ovarian cancers. We focus on discovery of circulating antibody biomarkers to naked proteins (TAAb), anti-glycoprotein antibodies (AGPA), and anti-microbial antibodies (AMAb). A.3.1. Tumor-associated autoantibodies as biomarkers of cancer Serum protein markers are used in routine clinical practice for monitoring advanced disease of solid tumors. However, early in tumorigenesis, the amount of these cancer-specific proteins produced by cancer cells and released into the blood serum exists at too low a concentration for many of them to serve as reliable markers for early  cancer  detection. Cancer-specific  proteins may  humoral  immune responses that  occur  early  in  cancer development  and  serve  as  a  signal  amplifier  (31).  Antibodies  against  tumor  antigens,  tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAb), have advantages over other serum proteins as potential cancer biomarkers as they are highly stable analytes and relatively easy to measure, using methods that are already established for clinical applications. The presence of TAAb in cancer patients has been observed for more than 50 years (31) but the pathophysiology  that  underlies  the  development  of  TAAb  is  poorly  understood,  but  may  relate  to  antigen mutation, overexpression, altered antigen folding and degradation, genetic factors, as well as aberrant post-translational modifications (PTM). TAAbs have been detected in early stages of multiple types of cancer (32). However, a particular protein antigen induces a cancer-specific immune response in only a limited number of patients, requiring that a panel of TAAb is interrogated to ensure the greatest coverage for most patients.   With support from the EDRN, we have executed several large-scale screens probing half of the human proteome in well-powered studies (typically >300 subjects, see BDL Section A.5 and B.3).  In these studies, proteins were displayed  as  wild-type  antigens  without  cancer-specific  mutations,  splice  variation,  or  post-translational modifications (PTMs). We typically observed ~100 AAb responses per person in both cases and controls (range 36-188), and only about 1/10 of these were cancer-specific. Individual AAb markers often had sensitivities in the 10-40% range.  We predicted that the limited sensitivity was due to underlying tumor heterogeneity, immune heterogeneity (people mount highly variable serologic responses)  and that screening platforms that displayed naked proteins, which may not resemble the full structural diversity occurring in vivo. Despite these limitations, our existing TAAb biomarkers for breast cancer have been commercially developed as a clinical LDT. A.3.2. Tumor-associated autoantibodies against glycosylated proteins as biomarkers of cancer Our current EDRN BDL focuses on aberrant post-translational modifications (PTM) that elicit disease-specific humoral immune responses (16). Autoantibodies (AAbs) against modified proteins have been associated with many  diseases,  including  citrullinated  proteins  in  rheumatoid  arthritis  (37),  methylated  SmD1  and  SmD3  in systemic  lupus  erythematosus,  deamidated  transglutaminase  in  celiac  disease,  and  glycosylated  MUC1  in various cancers (38-41). We believe that screening platforms display un-modified proteins, which do not cover the full structural diversity occurring in vivo and could lead to missed antibodies. Protein  glycosylation  is  the  most  common  and  complex  PTM  and  affects  all  physiological  events, including proliferation, differentiation, recognition, cell-matrix interactions, and immune responses (42-50). There are two major types: N-linked to the amide group of asparagine and O-linked to the hydroxyl group of serine and threonine.  Disease-altered  glycosylation  occurs  two  ways:  incomplete  synthesis  and  neo-synthesis  (51-68). Incomplete synthesis of O-glycans leads to the overexpression of truncated O-glycans Tn (GalNAc), STn (NeuAc (2,6) GalNAc), and T (Gal (3) GalNAc) in cancers but absent or weakly expressed in normal tissues (69-77). Indeed, many cancer-associated proteins have altered glycan epitopes (78-80). Although significant efforts have already  been  directed  at  identifying  novel  glycosylated  protein  isoforms  in  cancer,  a  potentially  powerful complementary approach would be to identify circulating patient antibodies that specifically bind to and recognize these cancer-specific isoforms. As these structures are not expressed normally, they induce immune responses (76, 81). In fact, the expression of the T and Tn antigens in carcinomas correlated with the presence of antibodies directed against these antigens and the prognosis of the disease (82, 83). Antibodies against cancer-associated glycoproteins might perform even better as biomarkers than antibodies against native unmodified proteins. The  epitopes for these TAAbs-AGP may react with cancer-specific structures comprising both polypeptides AND glycans.  Although  the  polypeptide  backbones  or  glycans  alone  may  not  have  the  specificity  as  clinical biomarkers, the combination of polypeptides AND glycans will elicit cancer-specific antibodies. Antibodies against O-glycosylated MUC1 in cancer using synthetic peptides with different O-glycosylation patterns on peptide arrays or ELISA and demonstrated TAAb responses to mucin-associated O-glycopeptide epitopes in patients with breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal cancer (84-87). Sensitivity at 95% specificity was as high as 42% for anti-MUC1-STn or anti-MUC1-Core3 in distinguishing between newly-diagnosed colon cancer patients and healthy controls. We found that antibodies to MUC1 glycopeptides were elevated in early stage breast cancer patients. We observed different sero-reactivity patterns between glycopeptides vs. peptides without modification. We also observed differences between peptides with different  o-glycosylation patterns. However, a recent study negated the utility of AAbs to MUC1TR glycopeptide as a screening assay for early detection of breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers (88).  This stresses the need for additional markers in order to produce a panel that will increase the overall sensitivity of the assay.  Notably, by combining MUC1 AAb signatures with p53 AAb signatures, we detected additional patients missed by either alone, demonstrating the benefit of combining assays. However, the utility of AAbs to MUC1TR glycopeptide as a screening assay for breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers has been questioned (88). This stresses the need for additional markers in order to produce a panel that will increase the overall sensitivity of the assay. Notably, combining O-glycosylated MUC1 AAb signatures with p53 AAb signatures detected additional patients that were missed by either alone, demonstrating the benefit of combining assays. A.3.3. Anti-microbial antibodies as biomarkers of cancer Technological  advancement  in  the  past  decade  has  expanded  our  knowledge  of  the  complex  and  diverse microbial communities that inhabit us. The entire respiratory tract is constantly exposed to the environment. Besides the lung microbiome, gut and oral microbiomes also exert their effects on lung through the bidirectional communication of microorganisms, microbial products, immunological effector cells and molecules that modulate immune response (19). There is growing evidence that microbial infections play an important role in benign lung diseases and lung cancer. A history of previous lung diseases has been associated with an increased risk of developing  lung  cancer.  Several  studies  suggest  lung  cancer  development  is  fostered,  in  part,  by  specific microorganisms. However, this is an area of active debate given that previous studies are limited by small sample sizes, observational study designs and inconsistent results. The  rapid  development  of  next-generation  sequencing  techniques  allows  the  quantification  of  microbial composition in tumor tissues without the need for culture. However, sequencing analysis reveals compositional changes at the time of tissue collection, usually at the time of diagnosis. Microorganisms important for cancer initiation may no longer be present in cancer patients. Moreover, the presence or absence of a microbial gene sequence in a sample provides very little information about its expression and its functional interaction with the host.    We  need  to  study  microbiota  and  cancer  from  different  perspectives.  Microbial  infection  often  elicits complex  host  innate  and  adaptive  immune  responses.  Sequencing  analysis  indicates  the  presence  of  a microorganism, whereas anti-microbial antibodies (AMAbs) demonstrate a biological interaction strong enough to induce a host response. AMAbs can serve a logbook for a persons infection history. The detection of AMAb has frequently informed disease research. Historically the correlation between pathogen-specific antibodies and cancer development has been instrumental to establishing a connection between cancer and a pathogen. For example,  the  classification  of  the  carcinogenic  nature  of  several  pathogens  by  the  International  Agency  of Research on Cancer relied on serological epidemiology studies.  Most  benign  indeterminate  pulmonary  nodules  identified  by  CT  scan  are  due  to  microbial  infections.  Our hypothesis to distinguish benign and malignant modules using AMAbs is two-fold. One is that the infection rates of certain microorganisms  may  be  different for  subjects  with  benign  and  those  with malignant  nodules.  The number of microorganisms that have been tested for cancer association is low compared to the vast number of microorganisms that inhabit/infect humans. A study at the human microbiota level to understand the association of patterns of multiple-microorganism coinfection with LC is especially relevant. The other is that subjects with benign and those with malignant nodules react to the same infection differently and produce different antibody profiles.  Antibodies  to  specific  antigens  may  be  more  informative  than  the  overall  infection  status. Evaluating antibodies to many antigens will enable us to find specific AMAbs that can facilitate cancer diagnosis. There are no systematic studies on the antibody responses against viral, bacterial and fungal proteins in LC patients.  The  presence  of  cancer-specific  AMAbs  does  not  demonstrate  cancer  causality  by  those (B)(A)microorganisms, but it provides a useful tool for diagnostics, and a starting point for further investigation into the link between the microorganism(s) and cancer to establish causality. Over the past 5 years, there is growing interest in understanding the association of alterations of the microbiome and  microbial-specific  immunity  in  the  pathogenesis  of  a  number  of  cancer  types  and  their  benign  disease counterparts (20-22). For example, previous studies suggest Chlamydia pneumoniae, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may promote lung cancer development. This is an area of active research as previous studies were limited by small sample sizes, observational study designs and inconsistent results. Compositional changes in various microbiota of the oral cavity, lung, and gut have been implicated in lung cancer development (23-29). Microbial infection elicits complex host innate and adaptive immune responses. The detection of anti-microbial antibodies in blood, the products of the humoral immune response allows us to infer infection history. For example, sero-reactivity against Chlamydia pneumonia provided strong evidence on the association between C. pneumonia and lung cancer  (30).    Antibody  response  to  other  bacteria  or  viruses,  such  as  Helicobacter  pylori,  HPV,  and polyomaviruses, have also been studied, but their associations with lung cancer remains elusive. Cancer etiology is  most  likely  polymicrobial,  involving  cooperation  of  microorganisms  that  are  non-pathogenic  or  weakly-pathogenic  when  acting  alone,  but  able  to  initiate  and  promote  tumorigenesis  when  acting  together  as  a community.  Respiratory  diseases  represent  one  of  the  first  and  most-studied  examples  of  polymicrobial etiologies  involving  virus-bacterium  cooperation.  A  study  at  the  human  microbiota  level  to  understand  the association of patterns of multiple-microorganism coinfection with lung cancer is especially relevant.   A.4. Development of innovative immunoproteomics technologies enabling comprehensive profiling of antibody response in cancer Our  ability  to  take  a  systems  approach studying antibody responses in case and control is enabled by several proteomics technologies we have developed with the support of EDRN that allows us to profiles antibodies  to  thousands  of  antigens  in parallel throughput (semi)quantitively.  A.4.1.  High  density  Nucleic  Acid Programmable  Protein  Array (HD-NAPPA) Protein  microarrays  offer  a  high-throughput platform to present thousands of human or microbial antigens to screen for  immune  responses  simultaneously (89,  90).    The  responses  are  rapidly identified  because  the  address  of  each protein is known in advance and there are no  representation  issues;  all  proteins, even rare ones, are represented equally.  An additional advantage of this approach is that the data can be evaluated to look for both informative individual antigens as well as for patterns of antigen responses with good predictive value. The proteins are arrayed on a single microscope slide requiring only a few microliters of serum per assay.  We will use an innovative protein array platform, namely Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA), developed in our lab to study anti-microbial antibodies and autoantibodies. Proteins are freshly produced using in vitro expression lysates from spotted plasmid DNA, thus circumventing the need for the expression and purification of tens of thousands of proteins as required by the conventional protein spotting protein arrays. Our use of human cell lysates for protein expression encourages the proper f",

FP00030322,617,,,,,1,,,"Nearly half of adults in the United States (US) will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime,1 however, some groups are at increased risk of getting cancer, and suffer higher incidence, and mortality than others. In the US, cancer disproportionately impacts individuals who are already socially, environmentally, or economically disadvantaged (collectively termed, social determinants of health, SDoH). Despite efforts to reduce cancer inequities, disparities in health insurance, exposures, cancer screening services, and access to quality care persist. Why is this happening? Health disparities are a policy-resistant problem, enduring in nature, and resulting from powerful dynamic forces generated by complex, interacting social and environmental systems that are likely to overwhelm interventions unless addressed through several levels.2,3 Translated to data terms, health disparities are challenging to model because the underlying causes are represented by multiple levels and types of data including the exposome, or totality of human external and internal environmental/behavioral exposures, internal omes like the genome and transcriptome, as well as accumulated clinical data over the lifecourse.47 What can be done? Artificial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ML) models are the ideal tools available that can deal with high-dimensional data generated over the past two decades, which continues to accumulate at an accelerating pace. Given the right amounts and types of data, AI/ML has the potential to generate hidden patterns, produce rigorous research insights, and enhance scientific evidence to tackle cancer and other health disparities. However, data sets that represent the multi-level interacting factors that cause health disparities do not exist in open and accessible formats to the broader AI/ML community. To solve these challenges and in response to the Bridge2AI Data Generation Program call, we propose to address cancer disparities with the aid of AI/ML technologies by building new innovative data sets that are comprehensive and accessible across medical domains, biological levels, and spatiotemporal scales; Machine Readable for a variety of AI/ML models; and representative in source material with understanding of biases and accessibility to support the work of scientists, innovators, future workforce members, and most importantly communities that are underrepresented in terms of data and workforce equity. In our research plan, we treat cancer disparities as a lens for the larger grand challenge of health disparities. Infrastructure, processes, and knowledge gained from enabling AI/ML technologies to address cancer disparities can be leveraged to other public health problems that exhibit steep social gradients (e.g., obesity, maternal mortality), and to deliver individualized precision medicine in healthcare.",
FP00030360,618,,,,,1,,,"ASU-Mayo-Banner Component for the Tool Development and Optimization Module Tools for collecting radiological images and making them AI/ML-ready (Jianming Liang, PhD)  Automatically and accurately gleaning clinically relevant information from medical images is critical for  precision medicine, demanding  solutions  that  are  empowered  by  artificial  intelligence  and  deep  learning  (AI/DL).  However,  developing  such AI/DL-empowered  solutions  is  impeded  by  a  Significant  Barrier:  AI/DL  is  data  hungry  in  nature,  demanding  massive, carefully labeled datasets, but medical images in PACS have no such annotations. Annotating medical images is not only tedious, laborious, and time-consuming, but it also demands costly, specialty-oriented skills. To overcome this barrier, we are focusing on developing methods and tools for annotation-efficient deep learning for medical imaging, aiming at making medical image data quickly ready for AI/M. To cover the whole life cycle of data, in this proposal, we propose to develop and implement 3 types of tools: (1) Tools for curating radiological image data: (a) select patients and their associated images and reports from a clinical PACS at any of our three satellite sites; (b) de-identify them followed by ethical and quality control; and (c) transfer them to our research PACS, which will be implemented and  installed specifically for this project. (2) Tools for  making  the  collected  data  AI/ML  ready:  (a)  retrieve  data  based  on  selection  criteria  (disease,  physical,  genetic,  and imaging phenotypes); (b) selectively annotate the most representative and informative cases to save annotation cost; (c) efficiently annotate diseases using medical concepts extracted from radiological reports; (d) interactively delineate lesions  based  on  a  suggestive  capability  on  which  images  and  which  parts  should  be  annotated  first;  (e)  characterize  each delineated lesion. (3) Tools for accelerating AI/ML models training and boosting the performance: (a) search for the most suitable architectures based on the fingerprint of data and available annotations; (b) create a Model Zoo with a large number of supervised or self-supervised pre-trained models; (c) quantify the performance, robustness, and annotation efficiency of methods  for  pre-training  and  their  pre-trained  models.  Please  note  that  our  pre-trained  models  are  not  for  particular applications, that is, we will not focus on training AI/ML models for particular applications per se, which is beyond the scope of  Bridge2AI,  rather  creating  tools  to  curating  data,  and  making  them  AI/ML  ready,  and  facilitate  AI/ML  training  and evaluation.   Dr. Liang (ASU) will lead this component with the support of his colleagues Drs. Greenes and Chung, in collaboration with data  acquisition by  expert  radiologists:  Drs.  Gotway  (Mayo)  and  Morris  (Banner),  as  well  as  the  research  PACS  by  Dr. Whitfill and Mr. Marichal. The development of these tools will be done with work in ethics to detect the attributes in which bias  is  expected  and  the  data  acquisition  team  to  ensure  such  attributes  will  be  correctly  captured,  as  wel l  as  with  the S&WFD module for skill development and workforce development, particularly, building and testing user-guides to ensure suitability  for  workshops  and  training.  Given  the  innovative  nature  of  our  tools,  we  will  actively  engage  the  standard development for our tools. Successful completion of the component is expected because (1) we have made solid progress in the core algorithm development [1-14], whose codes have been publicly released, and the main efforts are to extend the algorithms and implement them as robust tools of commercial quality; we are a strong interdisciplinary team of distinguished researchers and clinicians, and uniquely capable and well prepared for this component.

To fully unleash this power, it would be highly desirable to create generic source models directly from medical images for medical imaging, so that many high-performance, application-specific models can be derived from these generic source models via transfer learning. To this end, chest imaging would be an ideal choice since the chest contains some of the most frequently imaged organs (e.g., the heart, lungs, and thymus gland), and many diseases may affect the chest, with diagnosis often requiring specific or combined imaging modalities. While we have accumulated the largest  image  datasets  in  chest  radiography,  CT  (computed  tomography)  for  lung  cancer  screening,  and  CT pulmonary angiography for pulmonary  embolism, these datasets  are still relatively small for AI/DL. Therefore, our  goal  is  to  enlarge  our  database  to  exceed  one  million  studies  and  their  associated  radiological  reports. Collecting  one-million  chest-imaging  studies  is  ambitious,  and  may  not  be  accomplished  easily  in  a  single institution. Therefore, we have established an ASU-Mayo-Banner consortium. This effort is significant in that it offers a platform not only for developing high-performance AI/DL models and algorithms for the diagnosis and management  of  numerous  cardiopulmonary  disorders  (e.g.,  aortic  dissection,  lung  cancer,  pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but also for transcending the long-held, single-disease, and single-modality paradigm in computer-aided diagnosis and advancing core AI/DL methodologies across diseases, modalities, and specialties. However, its significance goes far beyond the chest, because these AI/DL models built from the chest images can be used as generic source models, and through transfer learning, they can be turned into application-specific models beyond the chest for diseases in other parts of the body (e.g., colonic diseases, kidney diseases, and liver diseases).  We  are  further  leveraging  a  massive  number  of  UK  Biobank  images.  UK  Biobank  (UKB)  has  500K participants; among those, 100K (rough 49K already available now) with high quality imaging data. Integrating our  images  with  UKB  images  provides  a  powerful  resource  to  address  those  grant  challenges  in  the  ROA, especially Grand Challenge 2: Expanding AI/ML in Clinical Care: (a) UBK imaging is the most ambitious medical imaging project ever undertaken in human history; the amount of imaging data collected on such a large number of  participants  is  truly  unique.  (b)  Yet  it  is the  combination  of  large-scale  multi-modal  imaging with  extensive phenotypic and genetic data that offers an unprecedented resource to conduct health-related research. (c) Our integration further saves a huge cost (UKB imaging costed 53M) while expands organ and modality coverage: UKB is on the brain, heart, abdominal composition, bones, joints, and blood vessels, while ours is on the lung; UKB is largely MR, while ours is largely CT and X-rays. (d) However, the UKB data are not AI/ML ready, as UKB does  not  contain  any  annotation,  requiring  significant  efforts  for  annotation,  but  our  proposed  tools  can  help create annotations and make UKB ready for AI/ML. Naturally, the successful completion of this module will exert an enormous impact.  draftASU-Mayo-Banner Component for the Skills and Workforce Development Module This  skills  and  workforce  development  component  builds  upon  our  data  acquisition  and  tool  development components.

FP00030363,619,,,,,1,,,"Project Title:   The Reducing COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in Rural America through YouTube (RECOVERY) Project   Summary:  Rural American communities have the highest reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and the least access to the vaccine, leading to the lowest COVID-19 vaccine uptake rates in the country. In these medically underserved areas, community-based pharmacies, deemed trusted alternative vaccine delivery sites, can help decrease hesitancy and increase access to care. The goal of our novel community-informed communication intervention is to address both vaccine hesitancy and stimulate uptake by conducting a social media campaign to reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase demand for pharmacist-administered vaccinations. Our interdisciplinary team will conduct a 6-arm experimental study which includes a 4-week non-skippable YouTube advertisement campaign. Intervention communities will receive tailored messages, delivered by a pharmacist, that directly address rural communities concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., self-efficacy to vaccinate, attitudes about vaccine safety and effectiveness, and subjective norms to vaccinate). Control group communities will receive standard information about COVID-19 vaccine (placebo message) also delivered by a community pharmacist. We will conduct three waves of survey data collection to assess the intervention impact on rural communities vaccine hesitancy. We will also collect community-level vaccination rates to assess changes in vaccination rates in intervention and control group communities. Finally, we will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews with rural community members (n=40) who differed in study outcomes to better understand aspects of the YouTube messaging that worked well and aspects that may need to be changed to better increase vaccine uptake. If effective, this work will transform ways social media is used to increase COVID-19 and other adult and family member vaccination and prepare for future rapid vaccination efforts for potential outbreaks in rural regions.     2",

Thisapplication is possible due to: (a) maturity of AI/ML to generate practical and useful predictive models,diagnostics, and therapies; (b) increased public awareness of how data help solve public health and individualhealth problems; and (c) more data sources based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, there isconcern that AI/ML could perpetuate or create new room for systemic discrimination. This could be avoided ifURM individuals play a major role in developing, deploying, and refining AI/ML models in underservedcommunities. Trainees typically learn better via hands-on data science training that uses data they care mostabout; therefore, we have designed a program where trainees learn and apply data science at healthcareinstitutions that host large amounts of data from URM populations. Because some of these institutions have notyet incorporated data harmonization and federated learning models, we partner them with institutions that haveand can advise their partner institutions on the roadmap towards a common data model (CDM) as well as settingup the environment for AI/ML federated analytics. We understand privacy and technical concerns: we keep bothdata and learning decentralized in order to preserve privacy and to scale: instead of a central institution providingall training and management, our center serves as a matchmaker that puts together (1) healthcare institutionsthat are ready to participate in federated learning with (2) institutions that are not yet ready but eager to, and (3)URM trainees and their mentors from educational institutions whose mission is to serve minorities.

FP00030431,621,,,,,1,,,"Specific Aims:Although cochlear implant (CI) is successful as a neural prosthesis that restores hearing in patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss, there is a large variability in CI outcomes in terms of speech recognition performance across patients (e.g., Blamey et al., 2012; Holden et al., 2013). A good understanding of the underlying factors for this inter-subject variability is needed before customized processor fitting strategies can be applied to improve speech recognition performance of individual CI users (e.g., Bierer, 2010; Garadat et al., 2013; Zhou, 2017; Goehring et al., 2019). One of the most important factors that contribute to the variable CI outcomes is the health of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which are the first gateway to receive speech information encoded by electrical stimulation. Different neural health measures have been shown to be correlated with the SGN density in animal studies and to be independent of the non-neural factors such as electrode-modiolus distance and electrode impedance in human CI users (e.g., Jahn and Arenberg, 2019; Mesnildrey et al., 2020; Zhou and Pfingst, 2014; Schvartz-Leyzac et al., 2020; Brochier et al., 2020). However, there is no consensus on which neural health measure is more appropriate for the applications of predicting CI outcomes and guiding the customized fitting of CI processors. In fact, studies have shown that different neural health measures may reflect different aspects of SGN status (e.g., Brochier et al., 2021). Also, the correlations between neural health measures and speech recognition performance have been mixed (e.g., Kim et al., 2010; Zhou and Pfingst, 2014; Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst, 2018; Imsiecke et al., 2021), possibly because high-level language processing and cognitive functions are also involved in speech recognition.To understand how the neural health measures are related to auditory perception with CIs and to validate the neural health measures for clinical applications, psychophysical measures of the sensitivity to basic auditory cues encoded by CIs (i.e., the temporal rate and place of electrical stimulation) should be compared with the different neural health measures. Pitch perception based on the temporal rate and place of electrical stimulation may have less dependence on top-down processing than speech recognition, and can be tested locally on the same set of electrodes as the neural health measures. As shown in our pilot study, neural health measures may have a strong correlation with pitch perception performance across electrodes and CI users. However, the relationship between neural health and pitch perception with CIs has not been examined in the past. This project is proposed to use a systematic approach to filling this knowledge gap. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the neural mechanisms of pitch perception with CIs and use such knowledge to develop innovative and effective processing strategies and rehabilitation protocols for better CI outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify the aspects of neural health that are critical for CI users sensitivity to temporal and place cues for pitch and speech perception. Towards this objective, we will pursue the following specific aim.Specific Aim: Investigate the relationship between neural health measures and pitch discrimination thresholds across electrodes and CI users. Three neural health measures will be tested. Polarity effect (PE) will be measured as the difference between psychophysical detection thresholds of the cathodic- and anodic-centered triphasic pulse trains, multipulse integration (MPI) will be measured as the slope of the function relating psychophysical detection threshold to pulse rate, and interphase gap (IPG) offset of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) amplitude growth function (AGF) will also be measured. Modeling studies showed that PE may be related to the peripheral process degeneration of SGN, MPI may be related to the standard deviation of SGN firing thresholds, while IPG offset of ECAP AGF may be related to the central axon demyelination of SGN (Brochier et al., 2021). Two pitch discrimination thresholds will be measured, including amplitude modulation (AM) frequency and virtual channel (VC) discrimination thresholds based on the temporal rate and place of stimulation, respectively (Luo et al., 2012). In addition, speech recognition in noise will be measured for each tested ear using the clinical CI processor. Our general hypotheses are that all the neural health measures and pitch discrimination thresholds would vary greatly across electrodes within each CI user, and that for each measure, the pattern of results across electrodes would differ for different CI users, reflecting the subject-specific patterns of neural survival. Neural health measures will have stronger correlations with pitch discrimination thresholds than with speech recognition performance. The expected outcome of the proposed research will have significant impacts both theoretically and clinically, because the findings will increase our understanding of the neural mechanisms for pitch perception with CIs and increase the accuracy of diagnosis for customized processor fitting of individual CI users.",

FP00030444,623,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY: City Nutrition: How Urban Foods Alter the Health of Wild BirdsOverviewThe abundance and diversity of birds living in cities is falling and nutritional factors may contribute to the decline. The goal of this proposal is to investigate how anthropogenic foods available in urban environments alter the physiology of wild birds by identifying variations in their gut microbiome, metabolism, inflammatory status, and cardiovascular health. The type of nutrients consumed by animals can profoundly impact their health, reproductive success, and therefore, also fitness. For example, our preliminary studies show that an urban diet significantly impairs blood vessel dilation, which may promote cardiovascular disease, in wild-caught mourning doves compared to birds that consume a nutritionally balanced seed diet. These findings are concerning, because wild birds living in urban areas have access to anthropogenic waste, high-fat seeds found in bird feeders, urban lawns, and gardens, and also higher densities of arthropods than rural birds. As a result, the diet of urban and rural birds likely differs qualitatively as well as quantitatively, yet the physiological consequences of this difference in nutrient availability remain poorly investigated. To identify the mechanisms by which urbanization and increased access to anthropogenic foods impact avian physiology, we will use the established NSF-sponsored Central Arizona Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) urban study system to: 1) Identify the abundance and diversity of birds and the urban foods they consume in the Phoenix Metropolitan and surrounding rural areas through an observational study; 2) Characterize differences in the gut microbiome, inflammatory status, and metabolic pathways of wild-caught mourning doves living in urban and rural environments; and 3) Elucidate the physiological effects of an urban diet on the gut microbiome, inflammatory status, and metabolic as well as cardiovascular physiology of rural wild-caught doves, which are likely naive to the urban diet.Intellectual MeritWhereas previous studies measured circulating macromolecules (e.g., glucose, fats, and proteins) in urban birds, to our knowledge this will be the first study to identify the choices urban and rural birds make when it comes to anthropogenic foods in their environment and how consumption of these foods alters their gut microbiome, inflammatory status, metabolic and cardiovascular physiology through controlled studies. Diet-induced changes in gut microbiome composition are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to systemic inflammation and the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Thus, our studies will determine changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome of urban birds that may cause such diseases. Through a controlled feeding study, we will in addition identify the mechanism driving urban diet-induced impaired blood vessel function. Metabolomics is emerging as a powerful tool to inform about diet composition and how diet alters nutrient bioavailability and metabolic pathways. Thus, metabolomics data obtained during this study may reveal a metabolic signature for urban diets that can be used in future research and educational projects. All findings will be submitted to the publicly available data records and knowledge base of the CAP LTER program. Broader ImpactsBird populations have declined in the US and Canada since 1970. Longitudinal data collected between 2008-2013 through the CAP LTER program show decreases in avian abundance and occupancy in the Phoenix Greater Metropolitan area. Urban populations of wild birds are exposed to, and presumably consume, a variety of poor-quality anthropogenic foods and this may contribute to their decline. As our proposed studies will identify species that consume urban foods over more natural foods (e.g., seeds) in urban and rural environments, in addition to assessing gut microbiome and metabolic physiology, the outcomes have the potential to identify species at risk of diet-induced physiological changes that could contribute to species decline. In controlled laboratory experiments, we will also measure how urban diets impact these parameters as well as cardiovascular outcomes in wild birds from rural locations that do not have access to urban foods. The results of our proposed studies will inform the broader community about healthy dietary options for wild birds by also evaluating the impact of feeder seeds as well as urban foods on avian physiology. The inclusion of Citizen Scientists with experience in identifying avian species will benefit the study as they will partner with the study team to quantify the abundance and diversity of birds observed consuming anthropogenic foods across an urban-rural gradient. A core mission of the CAP LTER project is to train students in urban ecology, which will be accomplished by the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students in each of the study aims. Data and outcomes will be freely shared with the public through online archives at ASU and through social media platforms that will invite the general public to view and submit photos of what birds are consuming in their environment. Results will also be broadly disseminated through publication in international peer-reviewed journals, seminars, and/or poster presentations at national and international scientific conferences.",

FP00030490_Rev1,626,,,,,1,,,"Tobacco use is the leading cause of cancer and the leading preventable cause of death. Alcohol use is responsible for ~88,000 deaths each year in the U.S. and is another primary preventable cause of cancer. The changing cannabis policies and the 8% increase in cannabis use in the last decade have brought new challenges for existing treatment efforts. Our recent studies among TTU college students indicate that over 50% of those who reported alcohol intoxication, tobacco use, or cannabis use in the past month were involved in two or more of these substances (alcohol, tobacco and cannabis - ATC). Growing evidence has shown that polysubstance use is associated with numerous and deleterious consequences for college-attending emerging adults, but they are often unmotivated to quit or reduce drug use. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address this critical public health issue of widespread polysubstance use in high risk college students. Despite multiple treatment efforts, outcomes are far from optimal since treatments often fail to capitalize on important target domains linked to addiction outcomes. Research shows that one target domain (mechanism) for ATC involves deficits in self-control networks including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the ACC-Striatum circuit. Based on previous research conducted by our team and others, self-control deficits have been linked to SUDs, and could be ameliorated through mindfulness meditation (MM) and/or EEG neurofeedback (NF), both of which target self-control networks and have the potential to minimize negative outcomes resulting from deficits in self-control. Although MM has shown promises in improving self- control and reducing ATC use, many struggle to engage in the mindfulness practice early in treatment. Promisingly, recent studies suggest that combining NF with MM may improve engagement with mindfulness practice and produce larger reductions in ATC use compared to MM alone. The goal of this project is to understand brain mechanisms of ATC reduction following brief IBMT, and optimize IBMT through EEG Neurofeedback (NF). We will assess self-control deficits and ATC use and examine the effects of IBMT and/or NF on improving self-control and reducing ATC use among TTU college students. Our study will be the first to reveal the brain mechanisms of combining mindfulness intervention and EEG neurofeedback for treating polysubstance use, and potentially provide preliminary evidence that the modulated self-control networks by IBMT+NF are associated with clinical benefits such as craving and ATC reduction in high risk college students.

Specific Aims R61 Aim: To examine brain mechanisms of improved self-control following an evidence-based intervention - integrative body-mind training (IBMT).  H1: Compared to active control - relaxation training (RT), IBMT will improve self-control through increasing resting and task-related activity in ACC/mPFC, and ACC-Striatum functional and/or structural connectivity (F/SC). Compared to RT, IBMT significantly reduces craving and use of alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis (ATC).   R33 Aim: To optimize IBMT practice through real-time EEG neurofeedback (NF). H1: IBMT combined with NF (IBMT + NF) results in more strongly increased ACC/mPFC activity and ACC-Striatum F/SC than three active control conditions  IBMT, NF, and IBMT + Sham NF. H2: IBMT + NF leads to significant reduction in craving and ATC use compared to three control conditions.  H3: IBMT + NF helps participants practice efficiently and increases engagement in weekly sessions.   B. Significance Emphasize the significance of the findings to the scientific field and their potential impact on health. Polysubstance use, such as alcohol, tobacco and cannabis (ATC) ties with numerous consequences for young adults, including poor academic performance, impaired driving, injuries, risky behaviors (e.g., unsafe sex), increased risk for substance use disorders (SUDs), and heightened risk for morbidity and mortality. Treatment outcomes, however, are far from optimal since treatments often fail to capitalize on important target domains linked to addiction outcomes. Previous research shows that one mechanism for ATC may involve deficits in self-control networks including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ACC-Striatum circuit and that these deficits can be ameliorated through Mind and Body Interventions such as mindfulness meditation. For example, our series Figure.1 of RCTs have shown that brief integrative body-mind training (IBMT) improves self-control abilities and changes smoking addiction behavior by increasing ACC/mPFC activity and ACC-Striatum connectivity. Consistent with our prior findings, in this R61 phase of the project, we found that IBMT significantly improves self-control, increases brain activity and connectivity in the ACC/mPFC and reduces craving and use of alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis (ATC) compared to the active control  Relaxation Training (RT) group.   These findings have significance to the scientific field and meaningful impact on health. First, our findings deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of novel treatment with theory-derived targets, as increased ACC/mPFC activity and/or ACC-Striatum connectivity are the same networks involved in ATC use, see Figure 1. These neural changes can help individuals cope with craving, negative emotion and stress reactivity, as well as mitigating the influence of other contributors of problematic substance use. Second, the heightened risk of polysubstance use/ATC use has become a widespread, critical public health issue. Thus, designing effective interventions for polysubstance users is of critical importance and is more impactful (in terms of reducing potential years of life lost and chronic impairment) compared to targeting older populations. Such knowledge from our R61 project will have significant implications for the design of new effective brain-based interventions with clear biomarker targets for ATC addiction and other addictions related to self-control deficits. Our preliminary data regarding the feasibility and acceptability of implementation of this intervention will inform a full clinical trial through a future R01 to examine the implementation of this proposed intervention in various settings.  C. Studies and Results Describe the studies directed toward specific aims during the current budget year and the positive and negative results obtained. If applicable, address any changes to the innovative potential of the project.  Existing treatments often fail to capitalize on important target domains linked to ATC outcomes. These target domains and their underlying neurocircuitry play a critical role in the initiation and onset of SUDs. Thus, target candidates are an essential part of assessment and treatment of SUDs. Consistent with the R61 goal, we aim to reveal the brain mechanisms of improved self-control following 4-wk IBMT intervention. Therefore, in the R61 phase of the project, we hypothesize that 1) compared to an active control  RT, IBMT will improve self-control by increasing brain activity and connectivity in ACC/mPFC and/or ACC-Striatum, and 2) compared to RT, IBMT will reduce craving and ATC use.  To achieve the R61 aims, we used a rigorous RCT design (IBMT vs. RT) and examined changes in behavior and brain following 4-week of intervention. Our study population (N=70) involves adults in Texas and Phoenix areas. Based on the literature, we used comprehensive criteria including self-reported user status (past month or year), use frequency (i.e., number of days used in the past month) and objective use quantity (i.e., blood test, urinalysis).  Inclusion Criteria: (1)18 years old; (2) free of any psychiatric diagnoses or medication (except a SUD to alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis); (3) currently smoking 3 cigarettes/day for the past year; carbon monoxide level  8 ppm; (4) consumes  5 drinks on at least 5 occasions in the past month; (5) current cannabis use  4 times per month [self-reports are confirmed via positive urinalysis]; (6) no prior meditation, RT or NF experiences; (7) normal or corrected-to-normal vision; (8) written informed consent.  Exclusion Criteria: (1) any severe psychiatric diagnoses other than a SUD (in order to better capture the efficacy of our intervention approach; future R01 trials will relax this criteria); (2) medical disorder(s) that may affect the central nervous system; medications that affect the central and autonomic nervous system; (3) excluding cannabis, evidence of recent (past month) illicit drug use. Behavior: we investigated changes following 4-wk of intervention (pre vs. post) of self-control including moods, emotional regulation, inhibition or suppression, stress response, mindfulness and behavioral problems and symptoms using NIH recommended toolkits including diverse tasks that are widely used and validated in the research fields. Analyses were performed for comparison of behavioral changes before and after IBMT intervention, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) and Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) showed significantly improvements (Cohens d = 0.687 and 0.611), respectively. FFMQ subscales Nonreactive, Acting with Awareness and Observe also significantly improved, suggesting brief IBMT promotes mindfulness state and trait for better regulation. Meanwhile, positive affect and cognitive reappraisal - an emotion regulation style showed significant improvements (Cohens d = 0.519 and 0.714), whereas perceived stress and negative affect were significantly decreased (Cohens d = 1.10 and 0.762), respectively. We also found anxiety, depression and ADHD were significantly decreased (Cohens d = 1.35, 0.776 and 0.631), respectively.   Consistent with our hypotheses, IBMT showed improvements on several indexes of self-control abilities such as decreased negative affect, perceived stress and improved positive affect, mindful attention and awareness and emotion regulation, and decreased behavioral problems and symptoms such as ADHD, anxiety and depression with medium to large effect size (all p<0.05), see three Figures below. Brain: Our preliminary results have shown that significant increases were observed in ACC/mPFC activity (pcorrected<0.05) in the IBMT group (Post->Pre-intervention, see Figure 2 below), but no significant change was observed in the RT group. Consistent with our prior work in smokers (Tang et al., PNAS, 2013), the observed brain regions with increased activity in polysubstance users overlapped with those we previously observed in smokers, which included ACC/BA32, BA10, and BA44 that also exhibited increased activity after IBMT. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in mPFC/BA9 activity after IBMT. Moreover, we observed large effect sizes for ACC/BA32 (Cohens d=1.10), BA10 (Cohens d=1.00), BA44 (Cohens d=1.76), and mPFC/BA9 (Cohens d=1.76), respectively.  Figure 2  Regarding within-group changes in ACC-Striatum functional/structural connectivity (S/FC), we did not detect any significant changes in neither group. Thus, we did not proceed with between-group comparison for ACC-Striatum S/FC. Because striatum has several subregions (e.g., caudate, putamen), we speculate that the lack of effect may be due to the fact that these subregions may be differentially sensitive to intervention effects on ATC use. Future research could explore the S/FC of ACC-striatum subregions to better understand the effects of intervention on ATC use.  For between-group differences in ACC/mPFC activity, we detected significantly higher increases in the activity of ACC/BA32 and mPFC/BA9 in the IBMT group than the RT group (pcorrected<0.05) (see Figure 3 below). Moreover, we observed a medium effect size for ACC/BA32 (Cohens d=0.43) and a large effect size for mPFC/BA9 (Cohens d=1.03).  Figure 3  Overall, the significantly higher increases in ACC/mPFC activity and self-control measures with medium to large effect sizes in the IBMT group than the RT group successfully met our Go/No-Go quantitative criterion.  Any changes to the innovative potential of the project.   We are excited to report one supplementary change to the innovative potential of the project: the inclusion of one short resting fMRI magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scan sequence (~5-8 min). The fMRI-MRS is a noninvasive technique for the detection of brain metabolites (neurochemical changes), which has been widely used in research and clinical settings such as addictions. We detected significant neurochemical changes in the self-control networks - ACC/mPFC following brief IBMT. In particular, brief IBMT increases glutamate metabolism in the ACC/mPFC with large effect size Cohen's d=1.13, see Figure 4 below. This finding is very promising as glutamatergic dysfunction (i.e. lower glutamate metabolism) is implicated in the addictions, pathophysiology of depression, and other disorders. Moreover, glutamate also contributes to the regulation of dopamine release in the reward system, which is important to the substance use and addictions as well as other mental disorders.  As far as we know, this is the first study to demonstrate that a brief intervention could change neurotransmitters in the ACC/mPFC and our findings provide preliminary evidence to help develop interventions that can prevent and ameliorate addictions and other disorders involving the dysfunction of neurochemical systems such as glutamate. Therefore, complementary to the ACC/mPFC changes in the self-control networks, neurochemical change in glutamate may serve as a new biomarker of addiction prevention and treatment and can be further investigated and validated in the R33 phase.           Figure 4  D. R61 Milestones Describing in detail the milestones met and data collected in the R61. R61 Milestones - Go/No-Go Criteria  This R61 study will proceed to the R33 phase if the following milestones - Go/No-Go Criteria are met: 1) Compared to RT control, IBMT improves ACC/mPFC activity and/or ACC-Striatum functional or/and structural connectivity (as indexed by significant time x treatment interactions and medium [d= .25] to large [d = .40] effect sizes); 2) We demonstrate that the intervention and control conditions can be delivered consistently and safely (which we anticipate given prior work); 3) We demonstrate our ability to recruit ATC users and retain them with an estimated dropout rate of 20% or less (consistent with prior work involving ATC); 4) We submit R33 study protocols and the R33 transition request application in accordance with suggested timelines. Based on C. Studies and Results, our results indicate that the R61 milestones  Go/No-Go Criteria have been satisfactorily met and we are ready for R33 phase. Below we describe the details of how these R61 milestones  Go/No-Go Criteria have been met. As shown in the NCCIH transition letter, primary mechanistic outcome measures will be the resting and/or task-related activity in ACC/mPFC, or ACC-Striatum functional/structural connectivity (F/SC). Below are the details of quantitative change for Go/No-Go Criteria.   Quantitative change for Go/No-Go Criteria # 1:  1.  The first quantitative criterion for Go/No-Go will be the between-group (IBMT vs. RT) differences for any two-wave comparison of the pre-/post intervention changes of either ACC/mPFC activity or ACC-Striatum F/SC (as indexed by medium effect size, i.e., Cohens d = .25 or greater).    Before conducting between-group comparison of pre-post intervention changes, we first looked at within-group changes in ACC/mPFC activity and ACC-Striatum F/SC for IBMT and RT groups separately (two-wave comparison, Post>Pre). For ACC/mPFC activity, significant increases were observed in the IBMT group (details described in 5.2 below), but no significant change was observed in the RT group. Next, we examined within-group changes in ACC-Striatum S/FC, but did not detect any significant changes in neither group. Thus, we did not proceed with between-group comparison for ACC-Striatum S/FC. For between-group differences in ACC/mPFC activity, we detected significantly higher increases in the activity of ACC/BA32 and mPFC/BA9 in the IBMT group than the RT group (pcorrected<0.05) (see Figure 1). Moreover, we observed a medium effect size for ACC/BA32 (Cohens d=0.43) and a big effect size for mPFC/BA9 (Cohens d=1.03).       Overall, the significantly higher increases in ACC/mPFC activity with medium to big effect sizes in the IBMT group than the RT group successfully met our fist Go/No-GO quantitative criterion. 2.  The second quantitative criterion for Go/No-Go will assess changes in ACC/mPFC activity or ACC-Striatum F/SC within any two-wave of IBMT group comparisons. We found significant increases in ACC/mPFC activity (pcorrected<0.05) in the IBMT group (Post>Pre) (see Figure 2). Consistent with our prior work in smokers (Tang et al., PNAS, 2013), the observed brain regions with increased activity in polysubstance users overlapped with those we previously observed in smokers, which included ACC/BA32, BA10, and BA44 that also exhibited increased activity after IBMT. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in mPFC/BA9 activity after IBMT. Moreover, we observed big effect sizes for ACC/BA32 (Cohens d=1.10), BA10 (Cohens d=1.00), BA44 (Cohens d=1.76), and mPFC/BA9 (Cohens d=1.76). Although we did not detect significant changes in ACC-Striatum F/SC in the IBMT group (p>0.05), the significant increases in ACC/mPFC activity with large effect sizes successfully met our second Go/No-GO quantitative criterion. 3.  Decision Rules: A medium effect size (Cohens d .25 or greater) for any two-wave comparison between group differences and within group differences of either ACC/mPFC activity or ACC-Striatum F/SC will be required to proceed to the R33 phase; The brain functional changes will be prioritized with a proposed increase as stated above. The brain structural measures will be secondary with a proposed increase as stated above; If both primary mechanistic measures do not show increases as described above, the study will not move on to the R33 phase. As predicted, both primary mechanistic measures involving brain functional changes in ACC/mPFC activity were significant within and between groups. Specifically, we detected big effect sizes for within group differences (Post>Pre) in the IBMT group for ACC/mPFC activity, which successfully met the Go/No-Go criteria. Likewise, we detected significant between-group differences in Post>Pre-intervention changes for ACC/mPFC activity with both medium and big effect sizes, which also successfully met the Go/No-Go criteria. 4.  As described in the Appendix of Transition Letter, we prioritized functional brain change measures over structural brain change measures (see details above). We demonstrated that compared to RT, IBMT increased resting and/or task-related activity in ACC/mPFC, or ACC-Striatum F/SC. If we find contradictory changes in these measures (i.e., the pattern of findings for functional brain changes is contradictory to changes for structural measures), we would focus on the findings regarding functional brain changes over structural measures. We did not detect significant changes in structural measures, thus no contradictory changes were detected.     Go/No-Go Criteria # 2 and 3: Following the R61 research plan, we have successfully completed data collection (N=70) and demonstrated our ability to recruit ATC users and retain them with an estimated dropout rate of 20% or less (consistent with prior work involving substance use). Most importantly, we have built an active participant database (N=591 until Nov. 2022) through R61 project which will be a great support for our R33 project implementation. We have demonstrated that the intervention and control conditions can be delivered consistently and safely (which we anticipate given prior work).  Go/No-Go Criteria # 4: Here, we submit R33 study protocols and the R33 transition request application in accordance with suggested timelines (by 12/28/2022). We are confident that the R61 milestones have been satisfactorily met and we are ready for R33 phase according to the proposed timeline (3/1/2023).  E. R33 Plans Summarize plans to address the Specific Aims during the next year of support.  Based on the preliminary results from R61 phase, in the R33 project, the overall goal is to optimize IBMT practice through real-time EEG NF as both IBMT and NF target the same self-control networks in the brain. In particular, our specific aims include: 1) Demonstrate that IMBT + NF indeed amplifies the changes in the primary mechanistic outcome measure(s) in comparison to IBMT in the R61 phase; 2) Demonstrate that the changes in the resting and/or task-related activity in ACC/mPFC, or ACC-Striatum F/SC for IBMT+NF condition are associated with greater changes in the alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis use, although statistical significance in clinical outcome changes is not expected. Although statistical significance in the clinical outcome changes is not expected, we will examine if the changes in the primary mechanistic outcome measures for the IBMT+NF condition are associated with reductions in ATC measures; effect size metrics of correlated change will be reported. Change scores in primary mechanistic outcome measures and ATC use will be estimated using latent difference score modeling; 3) Establish the frequency, duration, and/or format of IBMT+NF to have the greatest impact on the resting and/or task-related activity in ACC/mPFC, or ACC-Striatum F/SC and 4) Demonstrate that the study team and clinical site can recruit, randomize, and retain study participants with 80% of participants are retained for resting and/or task-related activity in ACC/mPFC or ACC-Striatum F/SC at the end of the study regardless of adherence to the intervention.  To accomplish the Aims, in the R33 phase, 120 subjects (30/group) endorsing concurrent alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis (ATC) consumption (excluding illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin) will be randomly assigned to ten 1-hour sessions across 4-week of 4 conditions (IBMT+ NF and IBMT + Sham NF, IBMT, NF). NIH recommended behavioral measures will be used to assess self-control, craving and ATC use at baseline (pre), post-4-wk-treatment and 3-month follow-up (three time points) to test the NF optimization effects. Meanwhile, functional and structural MRI will be administered to examine brain activity and connectivity in ACC/mPFC or/and ACC-Striatum, see R33 Protocol for recruitment, screening, assessments and interventions. We will also include a brief fMRI-MRS sequence in R33 project as a complementary brain measurement, see below.   R33 Primary Outcome    IBMT + NF will result in more strongly increased ACC/mPFC activity or ACC-Striatum F/SC than the three active control conditions  IBMT, NF, and IBMT + Sham NF using functional and structural MRI at pre-intervention (baseline), 1-month post-intervention and 3-month follow-up.   R33 Secondary Outcome   IBMT + NF leads to significant reduction in craving and ATC use compared to three control conditions using self-control measures such as moods, emotional regulation, response selection, inhibition/suppression, stress response, and mindfulness using diverse tasks widely used and validated in research.                   Analytic Approach Behavioral, physiological and brain data analysis will undergo separate analyzing streams to test for underlying mechanisms and intervention effects at different time points, see details below.  Data Analyses                     To address our study Aims in R33 phases, repeated-measures ANOVA will be used. by utilizing all 3 assessment points, this approach allows for well-powered tests to detect significant differences in changes across the experimental conditions. To examine differences between specific assessment waves, latent difference scores (LDS) will be estimated. LDS confer several advantages, including removing individual change related to initial level (a safeguard against any shortcomings of randomization). Importantly, this approach will allow us to statistically control for baseline variation in level of ATC involvement. Although we believe the proposed sample sizes for the R33 phases reflect relatively high N samples compared to the extant literature and we will be well powered to detect effects central to our primary Aims, effect size measures (from the repeated-measures ANOVA; Cohens d highlighting mean differences between treatment and control groups across assessments) will also be calculated to describe the interventions effect on study outcomes.   We will examine time x treatment interactions across the three assessment waves for all study outcomes using repeated-measures ANOVA. Given the larger sample size, the R33 phase will be higher powered to detect effects. This framework allows us to determine if treatment assignment is related to change in neurocircuitry (i.e., ACC/ mPFC activity, ACC-Striatum F/S connectivity), ATC use (separate for alcohol, tobacco, cannabis) and craving and measures of self-control. LDS modeling will be used to supplement these analyses by providing another index of the size of treatment effect across two-wave intervals and, in the presence of larger effect sizes, be well powered for inferential tests regarding change in outcomes as a function of treatment assignment.   To determine if NF + IBMT condition increases practice engagement in weekly sessions. We will conduct time x treatment interactions across 10 sessions to compare engagement in NF + IBMT condition to other conditions. Given: a) these analyses are based on 10 repeated assessments and b) we will compare the NF + IBMT to all other conditions (across the three remaining conditions), we will be very well powered to detect significant differences in engagement across conditions.   Functional MRI Data  Resting-state fMRI and task-fMRI data will go through different processing streams. The common preprocessing of fMRI data will be performed using SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), FSL (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) and REST software (www.restfmri.net) routinely used in our research. Steps include slice timing, realignment, co-registration, segmentation, normalization and spatial smoothing. After data preprocessing, specific analyzing techniques will be conducted to examine different aims.   Structural MRI Data   DTI data will be processed using FSL 4.1 FDT (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fdt/). After data preprocessing, we will follow the standard processing steps used for the VBM and VBCT analyses to create voxel-based gray matter volume maps and cortical thickness maps, including images segmentation (gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid), spatial registration, transformation into the MNI space, Gaussian smoothing, etc. Using functional and structural MRI, we are able to examine the brain changes of resting-state, task-induced activation, gray and white matter and its maintenance following interventions.  MRS data  Localized 1H-MRS was performed on a 3T MR scanner. T1-weighted structural imaging was acquired with 1  1  1 mm3 resolution for MRS voxel positioning. Point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) was conducted for estimating the metabolite concentrations in the regions of interest (ROIs)  rostral ACC (oACC) and dorsal ACC (dACC) based on literature. We divided ACC into oACC and dACC because of different functions in ACC subregions. Water-suppressed PRESS data were obtained with TR 2s, TE 90 ms, and 256 signal averages. Water suppression and B0 shimming up to second-order were performed with the vendor-supplied tools. Reference water signal was acquired for eddy current compensation and multi-channel combination. Spectral fitting was performed with LCModel software, using in-house basis spectra of 15              metabolites, including glutamate and glutamine. The basis spectra were numerically calculated incorporating the PRESS radio-frequency and gradient pulses. The spectral fitting was performed between 0.5 and 4.0 ppm. The Cramer-Rao lower bound was returned as a percentage SD by LCModel. The metabolite signal estimates were corrected for T2 relaxation effects using published T2 values. The millimolar concentrations of metabolites were calculated with reference to water at 42 M and compared between the pre-treatment and post-intervention groups.  Table 1 below is the timeline and flow of proposed activities.    Table 2 below is the planned recruitment targets at 26-35, 36-45, 46-55 and 56-65 months for 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the study participants for the R33 trial (N=120), respectively.

Milestones for the R33 project Month 66-72 Data cleaning, analysis and manuscript preparation Identify R33 milestones and discuss changes from the original research project. R33 milestones   1. IBMT combined with NF (IBMT + NF) results in increased brain activity and connectivity in ACC/mPFC and/or ACC-Striatum than three active control conditions  IBMT, NF, and IBMT + sham NF. IBMT+ sham NF does not differ from IBMT alone. IBMT and NF will each produce benefits in self-control abilities and ATC reductions.  2. IBMT + NF leads to significant reduction in craving and ATC use compared to three control conditions.   3. NF helps participants practice IBMT efficiently and increases engagement in weekly sessions.  Complementary changes from the original research project. Our R61 results suggest resting fMRI-MRS can also detect neurochemical changes in regions within the self-control networks in the brain. This new neuroimaging technique MRS may provide additional evidence for understanding the mechanisms and developing effective treatments of polysubstance use. We will include this fMRI-MRS scan sequence (~5-8 min) in the R33 project.      G. Conclusion  Based on the detailed discussion from Section A to F abovementioned,  1.  The NCCIH approved R61 milestones have been satisfactorily met. The R33 clinical study documents were submitted to NCCIH for review and approval on time and no major concerns was identified.   2.  R33 Specific Aims, Research Strategies, and Timeline/Milestones remain same in general, and R33 Timeline/Milestones and recruitment targets are reasonable and feasible. Based on the R61 activities and results, we plan to have 2 minor changes in R33 phase including 5-8 min MRS scan which can provide additional brain evidence and enhance the overall significance and potential impact of the R33 project but does not produce extra burden for subjects, and sample size N=120 which can produce the similar results with medium to large effect size but save research resources.                 3.  Consistent with the NCCIH Strategic Plan FY2021-2025, NIH HEAL Initiative and our meetings with NCCIH Director Dr. Helene Langevin about Whole Person Health and Health Neuroscience, our project aims and rationale remain a NCCIH program priority for the R33 phase.  4.  We have provided a detailed annual budget for the R33 phase project appropriate for the intended scope of work without changes, the budget is realistic and feasible for meeting the R33 milestones successfully.

FP00030518,628,,,,,1,,,"Almost 40% of adults in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime,1 however, some groups are subject to greater risk factors, incidence, and mortality than others. In the US, cancer disproportionately impacts individuals who are already disadvantaged. Despite efforts to reduce cancer inequities, disparities in health insurance, exposures, cancer screening services, and access to quality care persist. Why is this happening? Health disparities are a policy-resistant, or wicked problem. Such problems are defined by their immutable and enduring nature and are the result of powerful dynamic forces generated by complex, interacting social and environmental systems that are likely to overwhelm interventions.2,3 Translated to data terms, health disparities are challenging to model because the underlying causes are represented by multiple levels and types of data including the exposome, or totality of human external and internal environmental/behavioral exposures, internal omes like the genome and transcriptome, as well as accumulated clinical data over the lifecourse.47 What can be done? In the past two decades vast amounts of data accumulated at an accelerating pace driven by commercial demand have been used to generate artificial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ML) models that can deal with high-dimensional data. Given the right amounts and types of data, AI/ML has the potential to generate hidden patterns, produce rigorous research insights, and enhance scientific evidence to tackle cancer and other health disparities. However, data sets that represent the multi-level interacting factors that cause health disparities do not exist in open and accessible formats to the broader AI/ML community. In response to the Bridge2AI Data Generation Program call, we propose to address cancer disparities with the aid of AI/ML technologies by building new innovative data sets that are comprehensive across medical domains, biological levels, and spatiotemporal scales; Machine Readable for a variety of AI/ML models; and representative in source material with understanding of biases and accessibility to support the work of scientists, innovators, future workers, and most importantly communities that are underrepresented. In our research plan, we treat cancer disparities as a lens for the larger grand challenge of health disparities. Infrastructure, processes, and knowledge gained from enabling AI/ML technologies to address cancer disparities can be leveraged to other public health problems that exhibit steep social gradients (e.g., opiate abuse), and to deliver individualized precision medicine in healthcare.8",
FP00030546,629,,,,,1,,,"The notion of Health Equity can and should include the issue of representation of racial and ethnic groups working within the healthcare system.  There is profound underrepresentation of American Indian and Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs) in the healthcare workforce  especially medicine and nursing which reflects institutional and structural inequities. These inequities have had detrimental effects on the care and experiences of AI/AN communities as well as policies and practices that impact physical and mental health outcomes for this specific patient population.  Previous research in this area, as well as current pipeline programs and other diversity-focused programs have yet to move the needle on increasing the number of AI/AN medical and/or nursing students. We believe this is because these programs are working on the students, and not working with the students and their larger communities.  Therefore, we propose a mixed-methods, multi-institutional multi-faceted Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) project that engages the community of AI/AN undergraduate students interested in medicine and nursing, as well as the local Tribal, academic, and clinical communities, to explore the barriers, hurdles, and facilitators these students face in their pre-professional pathways.  This project engages AI/AN premed and undergraduate nursing students, active AI/AN medical and advanced nursing students, currently practicing AI/AN doctors and nurses, Tribal Community leaders and members, as well as key stakeholders in medical and nursing school advising and admissions, and larger health-oriented organizations such as the Association of Native American Medical Students, Association of American Indian Physicians, National Alaska Native American Indian Nurses Association, as well as representatives from the Indian Health Service.  Utilizing the CBPR approach, our goal is to work with these communities to provide a more holistic and encompassing understanding of the experiences of AI/AN premed and undergraduate nursing students at the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and societal (macro) levels.",

As illustrated in figure 1, our approach focuses on scientific/technological integration into a predictive intelligence system among the project team, which is embedded within a risk-based community approach, to connect to the communities and systems that would be making informed (or uninformed) choices about their individual and collective risks. Together, we seek to understand how to predict binding patterns of viruses for never-before-seen viral genetic patterns using data from prior observations, understand the variation in performance of predictive models over geospatial scales and use regularizing models, engineering optimal interventions that include resource allocation, contact tracing, and remote biomarker estimation with limited resources, use prior data on how this variation may influence policy making differences, overlay knowledge of human attitudes and behavior from using social science methods, and develop augmented decision making frameworks that are aware of these gaps in our understanding.",

FP00030679,633,,,,,1,,,"Primary care providers are limited to an average of 1.1 minutes to counsel patients on lifestyle changes, such as physical activity (PA), highlighting the need for interventions that address limitations of the current healthcare system. PA and exercise are preventive medicine. PA plays a critical role in minimizing glycemic excursions and preventing the progression of intermediate hyperglycemia (IH, or prediabetes) to Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Over 3 in 10 adults 18 to 64 years old have IH, placing them at increased risk for T2D. Interventions leveraging ubiquitous mHealth technologies show promise in enhancing the uptake, scalability, and sustainability of PA interventions, effectively increase moderate PA, such as brisk walking; and provide a population-health approach to improving adults health. However, mHealth PA interventions are rarely tested under different contexts or even optimized for chronic disease prevention. Thus, a critical need exists for evidence-based PA interventions that generalize to clinical and pre-clinical populations, utilize reliable technologies, adapt to individual progress (e.g., adaptive goal setting), and show sustainable outcomes. The use of Static Goal Setting (e.g., the fixed goal of 150 min/wk or 30 min/day) remains the modal approach in healthcare settings, disseminated PA interventions, and commercial applications for increasing PA. The National Institutes of Health(NIH)-funded WalkIT study was a two-year, 2 (adaptive vs. static goal setting) x 2 (immediate vs. delayed financial reinforcement) factorial randomized trial to increase daily accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among 512 inactive, healthy adults (aged 19-60). Results showed significant main and joint intervention effects: adaptive goals outperformed static goals, and immediate financial reinforcement outperformed delayed reinforcement for increasing MVPA. Adaptive goals + immediate reinforcement produced the strongest joint effect relative to the other 3 groups for increasing total MVPA min/day. Participants assigned adaptive goals were 36% more likely to meet daily goals and 50% more likely to initiate any MVPA each day throughout a 365-day intervention than the static goal group. One intriguing question from this prior study  that would encourage implementation of interventions in practice  is whether our novel adaptive intervention (adaptive goals + immediate reinforcement) works equally for adults living in neighborhoods with high vs. low levels of vulnerable conditions (SDOH).The purpose of this proposal is to test the effect of the evidenced-based WalkIT mHealth intervention for 100 inactive men and women with IH (18-64 yrs old) in a 3-month pilot randomized clinical trial and evaluate whether neighborhoods ranked high and low on the Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) moderate intervention effects. The SVI (Figure 1) includes social factors such as demographic makeup, poverty, crowded housing, and lack of access to a vehicle.  We will purposefully sample participants before intervention start from neighborhoods ranked high (SVI >0.80) and low (SVI < 0.21) on the CDCs socially vulnerable index, and then randomize them into either the intervention or control arms to test the following primary aims: Aim 1: Test the efficacy of an Adaptive Goals + Immediate Reinforcement intervention to increase MVPA compared to an accelerometer-feedback control group for adults with prediabetic hyperglycemia over 3 months. Hypothesis: The treatment arm (Adaptive Goals + Immediate Reinforcement) will have greater improvements (change of 15 min/day) in accelerometer-measured MVPA duration (min/day) over 3 months relative to an accelerometer-feedback control group. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of Adaptive Goals + Immediate Reinforcement to decrease HbA1c and improve other biomarkers (e.g., glucose, lipids) compared to an accelerometer-feedback control group. Hypothesis: The treatment arm (Adaptive Goals + Immediate Reinforcement) will decrease HbA1c by 0.5% and improve other biomarkers from baseline to posttest (month 3) relative to an accelerometer-feedback control group.Aim 3: Examine whether social determinants of health (i,e., CDCs SVI) moderates intervention efficacy for MVPA, HbA1c, and fasting glucose. Hypothesis: Adults from high vulnerable (SVI <0.21) neighborhoods will see greater improvements in MVPA, HbA1c and fasting glucose from the intervention compared to adults sampled from low vulnerable neighborhoods. IMPACT: Developing increasingly more potent behavior change interventions and understanding contextual conditions (SDOH) is a priority for chronic disease prevention. Results will offer evidence of intervention generalizability and test for which interventions work for which people to design more potent lifestyle interventions and optimize treatments for practitioners prescribing exercise as medicine to adults with prediabetes. The results from this pilot study can be leveraged for a larger grant to the National Institutes of Health for adults with prediabetes in Maricopa County.",
FP00030691,634,,,,,1,,,"Many chronic and other diseases are affected by lifestyle and making lifestyle changes has been a major intervention as well as prevention approach. However, often making such changes requires will-power that is difficult to achieve. For example, while more than half of the US population starts a diet annually, more than 90% of these attempts fail. Clearly, new technological approaches are needed to assist people with making these lifestyle changes. Recently, three continuous molecular biosensor devices have become available that allow monitoring of glucose, ethanol and skin conductance in real time. This provides an opportunity to use these sensor data to provide biofeedback to people making lifestyle changes. Specifically, we propose that we can use this data to extract rules that people can follow if they wish to achieve a specific outcome, in direct response to the data collected. The glucose data will be used for guiding decision making on food intake, the ethanol data on alcohol consumption and the skin conductance on stress levels. The combination of all three will shed light on how different lifestyle factors are connected. If successful, the project opens the door for the discovery of interpretable real-time recommendations on behavior that people can use to make decisions and then quantify the consequence of their decision. The molecular data can thus serve as molecular motivators that signal to a person a particular action in real time, motivating them to behave in a way consistent with the desired outcome, such as weight loss.",
FP00030754,635,,,,,1,,,"Despite the food first approach of collegiate athletic departments, most athletes report the use of nutritional supplements, some of which may contain banned substances as 20-50% of athletes report not using third-party tested supplements.  The goal of this project is to reduce the athletes risk of ingesting contaminated nutritional supplements. We will do this by surveying a representative sample (n=768) of Pac-12 student athletes to determine their usage of third-party tested and non-tested nutritional supplements; and to identify their knowledge of, attitudes towards, motivations related to, and barriers to their use of third-party tested products.  In addition, we will examine their athlete departments curricular materials and approaches related to information concerning nutritional supplements and third-party testing.This information will allow us to 1) better define college athletes usage of tested and non-tested nutrition supplements, 2) deepen our understanding of athlete compliance with nutritional directives by determining the variables, including nutritional knowledge and attitudes, that serve as barriers to the use of tested products, 3) determine the nature of relevant educational material that is available to these athletes, and 4) relate their usage of tested products to their knowledge base, attitude, and the availability and nature of their athletic departments educational resources.  Collectively, this information will not only deepen our understanding of athletes nutritional supplement use, it will also help departments to identify individuals at risk of positive doping tests and to identify strengths and weaknesses in their education materials and approaches to nutritional supplements and third-party testing.  Athletic programs will be able to tailor interventions to increase athletes use of third-party tested products in the short- and long-term.",
FP00030808,636,,,,,1,,,"There were approximately 16.9 million cancer survivors in the United States on January 1, 2019, with a projected increase to 22.2 million by 2030. Cancer survivors have a higher need for healthcare utilization but are more likely to experience sub-optimal healthcare utilization such as delayed care, forgone care, or cost-related medication underuse (CRMU) compared to non-cancer survivors. Cancer survivors also have a higher likelihood of reporting fair/poor health compared to non-cancer survivors. Sub-optimal healthcare utilization and health outcomes is worse for low-income and racial/ethnic minority cancer survivors and could be exacerbated by other individual-level and population-level factors. Food insecurity (FI)-defined as the inability of all household members to afford nutritionally adequate and safe food for a healthy, active life-is an important social determinant of health (SDOH). FI has been associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer. Food insecurity is also associated with sub-optimal health and healthcare utilization. Thus, food insecure cancer survivors are potentially at risk for worse outcomes compared to their food secure counterparts. These disparities could be worse for low-income, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic cancer survivors because these subpopulations have higher rates of FI compared to their high income or non-Hispanic White counterparts.  Residential segregation (RS)-defined as the physical separation of one racial/ethnic group from other groups within a given geographical location- is a population-level SDOH that has been identified as an underlying cause of racial disparities. Segregated neighborhoods are usually characterized by economic deprivation such as limited access to healthy food and sub-optimal healthcare access/utilization, further placing cancer survivors living in these areas at greater risk for poorer health outcomes.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)-a means-tested program- is the largest public policy program that addresses FI in the United States. SNAP has been consistently shown to reduce FI, and is strategically situated to alleviate FI among low-income cancer survivors. SNAP could also affect healthcare use by freeing up household resources that can be redistributed from food purchase to healthcare, and thus potentially improve food security, healthcare use, and health outcomes among low-income cancer survivors.However, extraneous factors such as RS or restrictive state-SNAP policies could limit SNAP participation or the impact of SNAP on food insecurity and health/healthcare among vulnerable cancer survivors.  There is a gap in the literature regarding the effect of SNAP on health/healthcare and food insecurity among cancer survivors, and the influence of RS on these relationships. The purpose of this study is to use the access-restricted 2011-2019 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to determine the relationship between SNAP, food insecurity, RS and healthcare use/health outcome among adult (= 18 years) low-income cancer survivors. We propose to accomplish the study purpose through the following four aims:Specific Aim 1: To analyze the association between RS and food insecurity. H1: Increasing RS will be associated with increased likelihood of food insecurity.  Specific Aim 2: To analyze whether RS mediates or moderates the association between FI, and health/healthcare use. H1: RS will not mediate the relationship between FI and health/healthcare use. H2: The adverse effect of FI on sub-optimal health/healthcare will worsen with increasing RS.  Specific Aim 3: To determine the impact of SNAP on food insecurity and health/healthcare and the role of racial/ethnic RS. H1: SNAP will be associated with a decreased likelihood of FI, and improved health and healthcare use.  H2: SNAP will have a more protective effect against FI and sub-optimal health/healthcare for residents of areas with higher racial/ethnic RS compared to residents of area with low levels of segregation. Specific Aim 4: To analyze the relationship between State SNAP policies and SNAP participation among SNAP-eligible cancer survivors and whether RS mediates or moderates this relationship. H1: More restrictive policies will be associated with decreased likelihood of SNAP participation. H2: RS will not mediate this relationship. H3: The adverse impact of more restrictive State SNAP policies on SNAP participation will be worse for residents of areas with high levels of RS compared to their counterparts who reside in less segregated areas. IMPACT: This study will provide critical insights into the relationship between FI, SNAP, RS and health/healthcare and SNAP among low-income cancer survivors. Identifying these relationships could guide interventions and state-level policies aimed at reducing FI and the potential adverse effect on the health of vulnerable cancer survivors.",

FP00030869,639,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Low-income Latinx are disproportionately burdened by the stigma towards mental illness, which may manifest as feelings of self-shame or embarrassment in having a mental health problem. Moreover, stigma can be exacerbated by prejudicial interactions with healthcare professionals or behavioral health care providers, or legal discriminatory practices by institutions (e.g., housing). Evidence suggests that different levels (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community) of stigma adversely affect the recovery process of Latinx affected by mental health problems, thus resulting in mental health disparities in this population. Specifically, research shows that Latinx are less likely to initiate and receive behavioral health treatment and have higher rates of attrition from behavioral health services than non-Latinx White patients. Thus, stigma may contribute to inequitable access to behavioral health care for Latinx. To counter the adverse effects of stigma, stigma-reducing strategies implemented by patient navigators may promote the recovery process of Latinx and ultimately lead to equitable access to behavioral health care. Patient navigators positively affect the processes of care in patients with chronic conditions frequently using strategies to address barriers to health care. These also include stigma-reducing strategies implemented through different pathways, such as educational sessions, direct contact, and/or advocacy, which have been shown to reduce stigma among individuals with mental illness, as well as healthcare service providers, medical and nursing students and caregivers. Although patient navigators positively affect patients experiences of care, there is a dearth of systematic information on the stigma-reducing strategies implemented in community settings where Latinx live, work, and play. This study applies ecosocial theory to understand the multiple pathways through which stigma drives social inequities in the mental health of Latinx. We use a mixed-methods longitudinal research design, guided by an adapted implementation science RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework to systematically evaluate how stigma-reducing strategies may improve equitable access to behavioral health care for Latinx. This study will achieve the following two aims: 1) Apply an adapted RE-AIM framework to evaluate stigma-reducing strategies implemented by patient navigators serving low-income Latinx in community settings, and 2) Use ecosocial theory to examine whether perceived stigma, in relation to sociodemographic, sociocultural, and structural factors, underlies differences in behavioral health-related outcomes between Latinx and non-Latinx White patients.

Together, we implement and evaluate high-quality early literacy experiences for Arizona students using drama. Through Early Years Educators at Play (EYEPlay)a strengths-based, classroom-embedded apprenticeship programpreschool teachers learn to integrate drama techniques into storytime to facilitate students whole-body engagement.  Evidence from this ongoing partnership supports EYEPlays efficacy in promoting language, literacy, and socioemotional development for diverse learners, including emergent bilinguals. Collaborating teachers have also anecdotally reported increased participation, engagement, and story comprehension during EYEPlay lessons, particularly for children who are non- or minimally-verbal. However, our measures have not been sensitive enough to capture program effects for these students.   The proposed study, therefore, has three aims: (1) evaluate EYEPlays impact on preschool teachers facilitation of inclusive, drama-based literacy experiences, (2) strengthen the experimental evidence base for EYEPlays effects on childrens language, literacy, and socioemotional development, both through existing measures and by developing and employing new measures that include children who are non- or minimally-verbal; (3) expand our evaluation of child-level outcomes to include assessing participation and engagement, by developing and employing observational measures that include all learners.

FP00030913,642,,,,,1,,,"Abstract Aluminum (Al) and lead (Pb) are neurotoxins that serve no known biological role in humans. As a society we avoid Pb, but are largely indifferent about Al. Yet both metals accumulate in our bones more than almost any other non-physiological elements: 50% of the Al and 95% of the Pb in an adult body are found in bonebut the regulation of the skeletal disposition of these metals and its impact on human health are poorly understood. Osteocalcin (Oc) is the most abundant non-collagen protein in bone. It undergoes vitamin K-dependent -carboxylation of up to three glutamic acid (Glu) residuesposttranslational modifications (PTMs) that add an extra side-chain carboxylic acid group to Glu residues, converting them to Gla residues. These PTMs facilitate low-affinity binding to calcium (Ca2+) and impart Ocs ability to bind to bone. Gla residues also make it possible for Oc to bind Al3+ and Pb2+and do so with an affinity that is >10,000 times that of Ca2+. We get vitamin K primarily from green leafy vegetables; yet only a vitamin K-limited portion (~45%) of most peoples Oc possesses the full complement of 3 Gla residues. In contrast, cows, rats, and mice almost completely -carboxylate their Oc. The premise of this study is that when adequately supplied with vitamin K, the body, through Oc, is able to control the deposition and release of toxic metals such as Pb and Al in bone, modulating their excretion and/or distribution to other tissues in a way that minimizes their toxic effects. To date, the vitamin K-imparted ability of fully -carboxylated Oc to bind Al3+ and Pb2+ with high affinity remains biologically vestigial and unexplained. Interestingly, Pb2+ binding to -carboxylated Oc increases the adsorption of Oc to bone mineral. Since Oc is a chemoattractant for bone-resorbing osteoclasts, this Oc-metal interaction modulates the bone remodeling process, leading to increased bone resorption and reduced bone density. We suspect that this is no accident, but rather a vitamin K-mediated process that helps maintain the mineral purity of bone and regulate the exposure of more sensitive organs to these toxic metals. The driving hypothesis of this project is that vitamin K, by mediating the -carboxylation of Oc, plays an important role in maintaining the mineral composition and purity of bone, regulating the exposure of more sensitive organs to Pb and Al. This hypothesis will be addressed via two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1) Determine how the impregnation of Al3+ or Pb2+ into bone HA alters the adsorption and affinity of human Oc with 0, 1, 2, or 3 -carboxyl groups to HA. Specific Aim 2) Demonstrate that vitamin K satiation associated with complete -carboxylation of Oc inhibits the deposition of Al and Pb into both growing and mature rat bones, resulting in greater excretion and altered deposition of these metals in other tissues.

FP00030933,644,,,,,1,,,"Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of pathology and implicated in nearly every neurodegenerative disease, but neuroimmune function remains difficult to define mechanistically in model systems and nearly impossible to interpret from clinical imaging data. Clinically detectable epiphenomena of neuroinflammation, like edema and metabolic changes are rarely correlated to a single mechanism, but they are ultimately the product of transcriptional programs. Here we propose a means to computationally derive the molecular signatures or, representations, of neuroimmune states from non-invasive imaging with MRI spectroscopy and from spatial transcriptomic data. Further, we will use these correlative representations of the same biological phenomena as a bridge between the two modalities.In preliminary work, we adapted recent advances in machine learning, sparse filtering (SFt) to render high dimensional biological data into human interpretable representations and a ranked list of samples that compose them. We continue to develop SFt to address data types that convolve molecular and spatial information. In spatial transcriptomics, each spatial vector contains data. Similarly, magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI), contains an array of spectral data within a spatial grid.

FP00030933_Res1,645,,,,,1,,,"Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of pathology and implicated in nearly every neurodegenerative disease, but neuroimmune function remains difficult to define mechanistically in model systems and nearly impossible to interpret from clinical imaging data. Clinically detectable epiphenomena of neuroinflammation, like edema and metabolic changes are rarely correlated to a single mechanism, but they are ultimately the product of transcriptional programs. Here we propose a means to computationally derive the molecular signatures or, representations, of neuroimmune states from non-invasive imaging with MRI spectroscopy and from spatial transcriptomic data. Further, we will use these correlative representations of the same biological phenomena as a bridge between the two modalities.In preliminary work, we adapted recent advances in machine learning, sparse filtering (SFt) to render high dimensional biological data into human interpretable representations and a ranked list of samples that compose them. We continue to develop SFt to address data types that convolve molecular and spatial information. In spatial transcriptomics, each spatial vector contains data. Similarly, magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI), contains an array of spectral data within a spatial grid. We will derive SFt representations of neuroimmune data to derive a minimal probe list to classify neuroimmune states with using multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH). We will then collect correlative MRSI and MERFISH, analyzing each dataset separately to further develop SFt to include spatial convolution, thus considering spatial information along with spectral and expression.

FP00030965,646,,,,,1,,,"More than 40,000 women die each year of metastatic breast cancer. With recent advances in treatment, including the FDA approval of several new targeted therapies, such as inhibitors of Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), women with metastatic breast cancer are living longer, but treatment resistance inevitably occurs, and quality of life is limited by side effects of cancer treatment. Mounting evidence demonstrates the importance of metabolic factors in breast cancer. These factors may be especially important in individuals treated with PI3K inhibitors, drugs that induce hyperglycemia through disruption of insulin signaling. Hyperglycemia is one of the primary toxicities of PI3K inhibitors. Data from pre-clinical studies show that the compensatory hyperinsulinemia induced by PI3K inhibitors leads to partial restoration of PI3K signaling and promotes cellular proliferation. Energy balance interventions, particularly exercise and intermittent fasting, are well-tolerated and favorably impact insulin, glucose, and other metabolic biomarkers in women with early-stage breast cancer. Research regarding the impact of these strategies on the metabolic dysregulation induced by PI3K inhibitors in advanced disease are needed. The preventing Hyperglycemia with prolonged Overnight fasting with or without exercise in women treated with PI3K inhibitors for advanced breast cancEr (HOPE) study, will evaluate a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of either 1) prolonged overnight fasting with moderate intensity exercise versus 2) an attention control on fasting glucose and other metabolic markers in 210 women with advanced hormone receptor (HR)+ breast cancer initiating treatment with endocrine therapy in combination with a PI3K inhibitor. Participants would undergo assessment of fasting glucose and related metabolic biomarkers, as well as assessment of physical activity, diet, physical function and patient reported outcomes at baseline (prior to the initiation of PI3K inhibitor) and 3 and 6 months after study enrollment. The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the impact of the intervention (vs control) on hyperglycemia in women who remain on the PI3K inhibitor at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include other metabolic biomarkers, use of glucose-lowering medications, patient-reported outcomes, and health behaviors. The HOPE study will also explore the impact of the intervention on tolerability and efficacy of the PI3K inhibitors and changes in gut microbial metabolism as a molecular mechanism by which circadian alignment of nutrient intake improves glycemic control.  The overarching goal of the HOPE study is to determine whether prolonged overnight fasting with moderate intensity exercise can mitigate the adverse metabolic sequalae, and improve treatment outcomes, in women with advanced breast cancer treated with PI3K inhibitors.",
FP00030968,647,,,,,1,,,"This proposal combines psychoacoustics, bio-inspired modeling, sound engineering, and architectural acoustics to investigate how the auditory system exploits temporal complexity in the acoustic stimulus, in the interaural cues extracted from the stimulus, in neural processing of these inputs, and in the weighting of this information over the duration of the stimulus. While there is a rich literature on temporal complexity for simplified, highly unnatural targeted stimuli, it is unclear how it applies to real world acoustic scenarios. The overall goal of this proposal is to begin to bridge this gap by taking advantage of the human ability to perceptually group a direct sound and its reflections into a single fused source of sound near the location of the actual sound source  the precedence effect. The precedence effect is heavily dependent on the temporal complexities involved in auditory processing, and thus serves as an ideal entry point to this investigation. Reverberation is well-understood in terms of physical acoustics, and ambisonic measurement of real room acoustic environments allows targeted stimuli to be accurately and realistically auralized in controlled laboratory setting. The measured room impulse response can be edited to span a range from highly simplified conditions to fully realistic conditions in discrete steps, so that a clear understanding of the mechanisms that are invoked as the stimulus becomes more realistic can be tractably analyzed. Aim 1: Investigate how the mechanisms that support sound source localization in simplified reverberation conditions exploit temporal complexity in the stimulus and in binaural cues to extend what is known in terms of modeling and behavior from headphone studies to a soundfield.Aim 2: Investigate how the mechanisms that support sound source localization in realistic reverberation conditions exploit temporal complexity in the stimulus and in binaural cues. The behavioral and modeling foundations provided by Aim 1 will be applied to ambisonically-measured room impulse responses (RIRs) to create a continuum of stimuli from those that resemble the simplified conditions in Aim 1 up to full auralizations of stimuli convolved with real ambisonically recorded room impulse responses by editing the RIRs.",
FP00031007,648,,,,,1,,,"Education is the engine of justice. It has the power to reduce poverty, improve health, strengthen economies, and combat racial inequities. This power begins early in life. A childs early experiences at home and in preschool affect the quality of brain architecture upon which future learning, health and behavior are established (Center on the Developing Child, 2007).Children who attend high-quality early childhood programs are less likely to require special education, to repeat grades in school, and more likely to graduate from high school than their peers who do not attend high quality programs (McCoy et al., 2017). Unfortunately, most early childhood programs in Arizona are not high quality. The 2020 National Institute for Early Education Research reports found that Arizonas early childhood programs met only 3 of 10 quality standards. Of the 2,477 licensed child care facilities in Arizona, only 922 are even enrolled in Quality First, Arizonas rating system for child care quality. Thirty-three percent of those programs failed to meet basic quality standards. By far, the lowest ratings were for instructional support (e.g. instructional dialogue, content understanding, quality of feedback, student engagement).We can increase the quality of programs by providing high quality professional development training to improve instructional support skills. However, high quality professional development is difficult to access and afford, especially in rural areas of Arizona. Our approach is to leverage Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), an innovative model for delivering high-quality professional development training, to move knowledge, not people https://chs.asu.edu/project-echo/join/early-language-and-literacy. ECHO projects link expert hub teams with early childhood professionals using telecommunications technology for training.Our primary mission is to make high-quality, effective professional development training available to every early childhood provider in Arizona for free. Although Project ECHO is used around the world for professional development training with effectiveness data for medical teams, we do not yet have data for effectiveness with educators. Our vision is to significantly increase the quality of early childhood programs in Arizona. To achieve this goal, we must demonstrate the efficacy of Project ECHO for changing provider practices and increasing childrens skills. We are seeking funding from Women and Philanthropy to conduct a pilot study during the course of three upcoming Project ECHO trainings targeting instructional support in the classroom.Our team has demonstrated the feasibility of using Project ECHO to train more than 300 early childhood providers from 12 Arizona counties this past year. These were organized and delivered by volunteers from ASU and seven community agencies in our collaborative; however, we cannot depend on volunteers to conduct efficacy research. Without evidence that Project ECHO is effective, we cannot approach state/educational/philanthropic organizations to fund future ECHO trainings, which will be necessary to provide sufficient ECHO trainings for high impact change. The positive impacts of the proposed project include (1) significantly more early childhood providers complete high-quality professional development training; (2) significantly more children benefit from higher-quality programs; and (3) pilot data increases our ability to acquire funding for increased Project ECHO trainings.",

FP00031014,651,,,,,1,,,"Patient work is the labor patients carry out as part of accessing healthcare services, managing illness and its effects on daily life and other activities, and carrying out treatment (Corbin & Strauss, 1985). During the pre-diagnostic phase, patient work for chronically ill patients includes finding the source of bodily changes (e.g., symptoms) (Strauss & Corbin, 1988) and undergoing a diagnostic quest which is the search for the meaning of symptoms or other manifestations of disease (pp. 24). STS, medical sociology, and related disciplines have previously examined the politics of credibility associated with knowledge. Credibility in this view is defined as the capacity to legitimize arguments as authoritative knowledge and be seen as individuals who present the truth (Epstein, 1996). This line of work shows that institutional structures maintain credibility of certain expert groups while not allowing other, non-expert groups to achieve credibility. This has the effect of systematically discounting the expertise of groups not deemed experts (e.g., laypersons). The discounting of patient knowledge poses an ongoing challenge for patients seeking diagnosis for chronic diseases and leads to delays in diagnosis; endometriosis provides one such example (Seear, 2009). Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder affecting roughly 10 percent of American women 15-44 years old (Buck et al, 2011). Endometriosis is associated with extreme pain that debilitates sufferers, often to the point of financial losses from missed work, and is a common cause of infertility (Soliman, 2018). Despite its prevalence and major impact on sufferers, a conclusive body of research shows that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 4 to 11 years; and it has been estimated that 60% of endometriosis cases are undiagnosed (Agarwal, 2019). Many endometriosis sufferers report extreme frustration with the process of diagnosis (Heffernan, 2021) and research shows that endometriosis patients perceive they are often not taken seriously by healthcare providers (Moradi, 2014). Endometriosis is an ideal case through which to study the burden placed on patients to act upon information associated with their bodies and the dynamics of expertise and credibility that surround these efforts. It also raises questions of gender inequities  research shows that women are treated as less credible patients when describing discomforts (Hoffman & Tarzian, 2001). Using qualitative methods (narrative interviews), the proposed research will address this pressing issue through meeting four objectives that lay the groundwork for a larger research study. These objectives are: 1) Develop a deep understanding of the diagnostic quest of endometriosis patients and the way in which credibility plays a role in achieving diagnosis. 2) Explore how endometriosis patients use IT (social media, consumer informatics tools) to seek information and maneuver politics of credibility as they pursue a diagnosis. 3) Describe the consequences (biomedical, social, emotional, etc.) of credibility work on endometriosis patients. 4) Write a grant proposal to fund a broader study that will deepen the empirical contributions and use participatory design to develop IT tools that help endometriosis sufferers to navigate the diagnostic quest and lessen the time from identification of symptoms to diagnosis.Logic Table On the provided logic table, please describe 3 project milestones.

Long term or future plans for this project are encouraged in this section.Using the case of the diagnostic quest undertaken by endometriosis patients, the proposed research will contribute rich qualitative empirical understandings of the patient work required to establish credibility of knowledge as a patient seeking a diagnosis, and the consequences of this credibility work. Theoretically, this study will add to literature on patient work by theorizing credibility as a core aspect of patient work. Further, this work will extend theorizing on credibility, particularly the work of Epstein, by examining medical diagnosis as a site of credibility work and the situated practices through which individual laypersons navigate the politics of credibility as they seek to establish credible knowledge within environments where their knowledge is devalued in favor of expert knowledge. Research findings will be disseminated to academic audiences through presenting findings to multiple academic audiences (Science and Technology Studies and Health Informatics) through conference presentations (e.g., at Society for Social Studies of Science conference and the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing) and publishing articles in venues including Social Science and Medicine, PACM HCI, and International Journal of Medical Informatics. To ensure translation to healthcare audiences, results will be presented in healthcare venues including Mayo Clinics Minimally Disruptive Medicine Conference. We are building direct partnerships with endometriosis support groups and will trans it findings to these groups. The research funded by this grant is crucial to establish pilot data for a grant proposal to design and test tools to support the diagnostic quest of endometriosis patients. We will ensure sustainability of this larger project through creating strong relationships with endometriosis patient advocacy groups and leveraging existing relationships that the study team has with healthcare organizations including Mayo Clinic and HonorHealth.",
FP00031034,652,,,,,1,,,"Obesity remains one of the biggest public health challenges worldwide. Obesity is associated with various comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases, leading to a shorter lifespan and higher medical costs. Recent studies have indicated that obesity is also associated with the high prevalence and severity of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a fat type responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis and now known to exist in adult humans, has emerged as a novel target to increase energy expenditure and improve systemic metabolism for obesity prevention. In addition, a browning process, i.e., the appearance of beige adipocytes within white adipose tissue (WAT) depots in response to cold or other stimulations, has also been reported. However, to our knowledge, there are still no practical and effective ways to stimulate thermogenesis in humans except for cold exposure or -adrenergic stimulation, which is associated with side effects and low compliance. We have discovered that 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EEQ, an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-derived epoxy fatty acid) at a much lower dose, when stabilized by a pharmacological inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (the enzyme that degrades epoxy fatty acids), significantly increased core body temperature and heat production and improved blood triglycerides and glucose levels in diet-induced obesity. The thermogenic efficacy of 17,18-EEQ is potent than 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (EDP, a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived epoxy fatty acid) and much more potent than the reported EPA or fish oil enriched with EPA and DHA. The results suggest 17,18-EEQ may contribute to EPAs beneficial thermogenic effects for obesity treatment and prevention at a much higher efficiency. Adipose stromal cells are precursors for brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes. Nanoencapsulation targeting adipose stromal cells have proven to be an effective delivery strategy to increase delivery efficiency and minimize side effects for nutrients. The goal of this proposal is to unleash EPAs thermogenic potential by adipose stem cell delivery of its effective metabolite 17,18-EEQ. We will explore the thermogenic potential of this strategy in preclincial models: diet-induced obese mice and human adipose stromal cells. In light of the importance of activation of thermogenesis for human obesity prevention and treatment, it is critically important to identify novel, safe, and effective agent(s) that can boost thermogenesis. Therefore, we propose to determine nanoparticles characteristics, biodistribution and target efficacy and efficacy of adipose stromal cell-targeted nanoparticles encapsulated with 17,18-EEQ alone or combined with an sEH inhibitor in inducing thermogenesis and improving systemic metabolism in diet-induced obese mice (Aim 1) and confirm effects of the strategy in increasing thermogenesis by promoting browning and brown adipogenesis from the adipose stromal cells of mouse and human origins (Aim 2).",
FP00031125,653,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Emergency response protocols for treating overdose in the field often include administration of naloxone to reverse overdose but no standard procedure exists for after the patient is stabilized. Post-stabilization protocols vary widely; some first responders transfer patients to the hospital or call in behavioral health professionals to broker services, while others leave a stable overdose patient without any further service or follow-up. Results from a needs assessment conducted by our team with first responders indicated that first responders shared information on treatment and social service resources <24% of the time. To capitalize on the time after a patient becomes stable following an overdose (but before first responders depart the scene), we created and piloted First Resource. First Resource is a simple, intuitive smartphone application for use by first responders. The app allows first responders to share social service and treatment resources, using motivational techniques, with community members quickly and anonymously. As the only class of provider who consistently administers care to overdose victims in the field, first responders are uniquely situated to improve opioid overdose response and prevent recurrent overdoses in a community. At the point when first responders engage with community members, they have a distinct opportunity to motivate and connect the community member (or their supporters) to providers of key treatments that address opioid addiction directly, such as medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and other social and behavioral health services.  First Resource will assist first responders as they work to integrate systems of care, connecting community members to vital social and treatment services. It will also serve as a catalyst for institutional culture change in first responder departments, ensuring that referral becomes a regular and rote end to every crisis response interaction. With our study, we focus on four major aims: Aim 1- Enhance the First Resource app prototype in preparation for evaluation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by triangulating preliminary data with new qualitative data collected from first responder stakeholders. Aim 2- Assess efficacy of the First Resource app in (a) increasing first responders' provision of follow-up service contact information to patients post-stabilization; (b) reducing compassion fatigue and increasing compassion and hopefulness; and (c) increasing first responder well-being, via RCT. Aim 3- Assess efficacy of the First Resource app in increasing: (a) the proportion of patients who contact a service provider (e.g., OUD treatment) post engagement; (b) patient ratings of first responder compassion/caring/concern; and (c) treatment-seeking behavior intentions after engaging with a first responder. Aim 4- Build statewide stakeholder capacity for connecting community members at-risk of overdose with follow-up services and decrease first responder perceptions of stigma associated with people who use opioids. The evidence-based Organizational Process Improvement Intervention (OPII) along with Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods will frame our study. ",
FP00031152,654,,,,,1,,,"The objective of this two-year project is to examine the characteristics of spatial listening and learning in children with hearing loss compared to their peers with normal hearing. The first aim is to examine the effects of hearing loss on the perception of speech along spectral, temporal, and spatial dimensions. The second aim is to examine the effects of asymmetric auditory input to the two ears to identify spectral, temporal, and spatial factors that are vulnerable to asymmetries due to hearing loss or to hearing aid fitting.  Children will perceive, learn, and recall speech that is presented from six different locations from the front and back and from the left and right. Accurate verbal repetition of speech from each source location will indicate their ability to resolve the spectral and spatial characteristics of the stimuli. The ability to resolve the temporal characteristics of speech perception will be evaluated with two tasks that require the child to retain the words they hear for seconds (0 to 30) and for minutes (30). Evidence in our lab suggests that children with hearing loss retain words perceived on their right side longer than words perceived on their left side. The same left-side loss occurs in children with normal hearing but the effect is much smaller. Finally, novel hearing aid fittings will be explored to determine if the asymmetry in listening and learning in children with hearing loss can be corrected with asymmetric hearing-aid fitting strategies. This 2-year project will be conducted in the Pediatric Amplification lab and the Spatial Hearing lab at Arizona State University. A total of 220 8- to 15-year-old children (110 with normal hearing, 110 with hearing loss) will participate in five experiments. Each experiment will require 2 hours of participation.

However,  the  general  unsatisfactory  results  of  at-home  PT  compared  to  PT  performed  under  direct  clinical supervision  have  made this  a  very  active  and  potentially  high  impact  area  of  research   [1]  [2].  Improving the safety of home based exercise programs is also an emerging concern.  Typically, at home therapeutic programs aimed at improving compliance and correctness monitoring, fall short because they cannot emulate approaches used  by  individual  therapists  such  as  providing  highly  personalized  biofeedback.  Wearable  sensors  for biomechanics can generate powerful data but they need significant analytical effort and strong validation of their linkage to the physical domain to be useful for biofeedback. We propose to explore a new sensor array design and  a  personalized  3D  biomechanical  spine  model  that  will  close  the  physical-digital  gap  and  enable  visual biomechanical biofeedback based on a virtual therapy supervisor to support home based exercise therapy aimed at improving strength, mobility, and flexibility of the spine. Personalizing  a  spinal  model  according  to  local  and  regional  flexibility  will  enable  modeling  the  curvature  at different orientations of the spinal axis in 3D. Our preliminary work has shown that star configuration of 4 stretch sensors attached to 4 points of the dorsal surface enable generic modeling of the spinal axis orientation based on projective transformations of the sensor area, while the actual curvature of the spine will depend on local and regional  flexibility  and  range  of  motion  for  each  patient.  The  generic  models  will  need  to  be  parametrized according to individual spine flexibility, biomechanics, and curvature parameters. With the ability to visualize the spine  from  a  variety  of  viewpoints  on  semitransparent  smart  glasses,  and  the  potential  to  augment  the visualization with expert guidance cues, it will be possible to assess the feasibility of immersive Biomechanical BioFeedback (IBBF) incorporating customizable expert supervision rules. Aims: We propose (i) to develop a sensor-congruent biomechanical model using linear, non-linear, and deep learning  methods  to  link  wearable  sensors  to  spine  biomechanics  to  enable  real  time  visualization  of  a personalized  3D  spine  model;  (ii)  capture  expert  rules  and  principles  for  a  virtual  supervisor  to  provide biomechanical biofeedback; and (iii) conduct a pilot study to test usability with healthy subjects and physical therapy patients. Broader impact: Information gained from the acceptability test results, will be used to design, and conduct a randomized exercise intervention study to test the effectiveness of exercise training at home, in a real life setting, using  the  virtual  supervision  system.  In  the  long  term,  this  project  can  potentially  result  in  a  sweeping transformative  effect  on methods  and  technology-assisted  exercise  supervision.

FP00031222,657,,,,,1,,,"Skeletal development, homeostasis, disease and repair is the result of complex interactions between numerous tissues, cell types, and growth factor signaling pathways. Disruptions in normal bone formation processes can occur both via genetic and non-genetic stimuli, and can lead to inappropriate bone formation called heterotopic ossification (HO). Currently, detailed understanding of many human mineralized tissue diseases, including genetic and non-genetic forms of HO, remain elusive. Here we are studying fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a congenital disease of significant and progressive HO that is 100% lethal in individuals harboring FOP associated genetic mutations in ACVR1.  Although much progress has been made in the field, many questions remain about how FOP associated ACVR1 variant signaling mediates the explosive HO observed in FOP. Due to the extreme danger of injury induced HO formation in FOP patients, tissue samples are very difficult to obtain.  Conveniently, FOP patients do shed their baby (deciduous) teeth, providing the means to harvest dental pulp tissue from exfoliated teeth, to use to establish primary cell cultures of dental pulp stem cells for in vitro and in vivo analyses.  In addition, zebrafish heat-shock inducible models for FOP, recently established by the Yelick Lab, allow for the study FOP variant signaling pathways in this highly tractable and human relevant animal model.The objectives of the proposed studies are to: 1) use newly established primary DPSC cell culture models to characterize signaling pathways leading to osteogenic differentiation: and 2) exploit newly created FOP zebrafish models to define FOP associated ACVR1 variant signaling pathways in an in vivo zebrafish model.These studies are innovative as they use in vitro, in silico structural modeling, and in vivo approaches to thoroughly interrogate and define signaling pathways mediating HO in FOP.  To enable this innovative integration of different approaches, we have partnered with an expert in computational and experimental structural biology and biophysics, Prof. Klein-Seetharaman at Arizona State University. The studies are significant as they address the unmet need for more effective treatment strategies for FOP patients, and for HO in general both in FOP and in other conditions such as post-surgical patients, wounded military personnel, burn patients and elderly populations. In addition, the ability to use identified HO signaling pathways, in a controlled manner, to regenerate bone when needed, would also be highly significant. As such, the impact of the proposed studies is high, based on the extensive published expertise of the Research Team, the significance of HO as a serious health issue particularly in FOP patients, and the demonstrated utility of in silico, in vitro and in vivo zebrafish models to study human disease. Successful completion of the proposed studies will are likely to contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat HO in humans while also elucidating novel pathways and regulators of bone growth and regeneration.",

While COVID-19 vaccines reduce hospitalizations and death, pregnant refugee women are a population least likely to vaccinate against COVID-19 - only 1.5% vaccinated, antenatally. This study explores barriers, facilitators, and social determinants of health of pregnant and lactating refugee women to better understand their decisions about vaccinating against COVID-19.  We will use a racial equity lens and the Positive Deviance framework to guide our study. Our research aims to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (Aim 1) to examine patients personal health information, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. We will also investigate the influence of geographic, socioeconomic, and neighborhood-level factors on COVID-19 vaccine uptake, analyzing publicly available data.  The outcomes of our analyses will also help us identify positive deviants, pregnant and lactating refugee women who previously vaccinated against COVID-19 (during pregnancy or postpartum). For Aim 2 of our study, we will conduct in-depth interviews with 45 women, including positive deviant women (identified in Aim 1) and vaccine-hesitant pregnant and lactating refugee women. We will explore both facilitating factors and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake. In Aim 3 of our study, we will conduct a series of iterative focus groups with an existing Refugee Community Stakeholder Panel to triangulate and further contextualize the quantitative AI data with qualitative in-depth interview findings to inform precision population health strategies. Our proposed study will elucidate actionable risk factors of COVID-19 vaccination inequity and evidence-based from AI models and the in-depth interview findings to develop and prioritize evidence-based strategies for future interventions. We will analyze AI-identified PDs interview responses to discover factors associated with interventions to improve vaccine uptake for pregnant and lactating refugee women, a severely underserved high-risk population. Our research will also demonstrate the combination of mixed methods, employing AI and community engagement to inform precision population health strategies that we can test in future intervention research.

FP00031305,661,,,,,1,,,"Overview    Most U.S. cities are served by All-Hazards Fire Departments that respond to various medical, fire, and safety emergencies. As outlined by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA, 2020) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of Emergency Medical Services (EMS.gov, 2020), the fire service anticipates a future in which much of their work focuses on community risk reduction (CRR), a paradigm that seeks to mitigate risks before they lead to emergencies in the first place. The CRR paradigm  will  leverage new data-driven risk prediction and management (DDRPM) tools to predict and manage a variety of community risks. DDRPM tools offer potential to transform the fire services ability to reduce community risks, and to operate effectively and efficiently given increasing 911 call volume. Yet, designing DDRPM tools to realize this vision requires deep understanding of current work practices, and the  potential future impacts of such tools on labor (e.g., increased data work), workers (e.g., increased disparities in risk knowledge), and communities (e.g., intensified surveillance of marginalized/at-risk populations). The intersection of sociotechnical work practices for handling risks and design of data-driven computational tools  make this an ideal site of human-centered computing research.    This project has multiple goals: (1) comprehensive empirical exploration of community-oriented risk work performed by fire personnel, (2) development of a human-centered design process for the future of DDRPM tools, (3) co-designing speculative DDRPM tools with fire departments, and (4) developing a sociotechnical theory of risk work. We will achieve these goals in three phases. First, we will document current practices of community-focused risk work and community data resources using in-depth ethnographic research in three fire departments in different contexts across the United States. Second, we will co-design speculative prototypes for DDRPM with our study participants. Third, we will evaluate our speculative prototypes to understand how the speculative designs shift visions of technologically-supported community risk work for the fire service.  Intellectual Merit    The proposed research will produce empirical, methodological, and theoretical scholarly contributions. There is a lack of research on the practices and technologies for handling community risk in the fire service. We will fill this gap through empirically describing present community-focused risk work practices, data resources, and technologies using ethnographic research. Further, these ethnographic data will be leveraged as part of a novel human-centered design process that combines ethnography, inquiry through design, participatory design, and speculative design. Using this process, researchers and stakeholders will co-design speculative prototypes for DDRPM tools. Participatory speculative design will fill a crucial gap in research and design of sustainable data-driven tools for risk handling by enabling consideration of impacts of design of DDRPM tools on future work practices in the fire service and on communities. Finally, the role of technology in risk work is under-theorized. This research will result in the development of a sociotechnical theory of risk work using abductive methods that draw on ethnographic and inquiry-through-design data to provoke and extend theory.Broader Impacts    The fire service is key to the health, safety, and security of individuals, communities, and society, thus this research is primed to provide lasting, practical benefits. This project will directly benefit the study sites and the populations they serve since insights drawn from ethnographic research will be distributed to study sites and participants. Further, we will disseminate both our design process and the co-designed speculative prototypes to the fire service professional community. The development and dissemination of a process of participatory speculative design for DDRPM tools will equip fire service stakeholders to anticipate and shape their desired futures rather than passively accepting technological innovations. Agencies and workers tasked with handling risks in an array of domains (e.g. education, social services, and medicine) will have practical tools, frameworks, and vocabularies that allow them to pro-actively envision the functionalities and forms of future risk prediction and management tools.",

FP00031365,663,,,,,1,,,"Wearables are poised to transform health and wellness through automation of cost-effective, objective, continuous, and real-time health monitoring and interventions. Currently, however, computational models for these systems are designed based on labeled training data collected in controlled settings. This has created a number of real impediments to scalability of wearables because (i) collecting sufficiently large amounts of labeled sensor data is a time consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive pro-cess that has been identified as a major barrier to personalized and precision medicine; and (ii) wearables are deployed in highly dynamic environments of the end-users whose physical, behavioral, social, and environ-mental context undergoes consistent changes. Such changes result in drastic performance degradation of the computational models trained in laboratory settings. The overarching goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop algorithms and tools that enable future wearables to learn in-situ autonomously, operate in-the-wild reliably, and adapt to the changing context of their users automatically.Intellectual Merit. This project is transformative because it will yield the first end-to-end solutions that will enable autonomous, reliable, and robust learning of wearable computing algorithms in naturalistic settings without need for collecting any labeled sensor data. The proposal aims to develop foundations of computa-tional autonomy for wearable-based health monitoring and interventions through the following intellectually rigorous objectives:Autonomous sensor data labeling: we will research methods of autonomous labeling of sensor data in a new setting (i.e., target), based on labeled training data collected in a different setting (i.e., source). We will devise algorithms for cross-subject, cross-context, cross-platform, and cross-modality labeling by developing combinatorial approaches to identify an optimal mapping from target to source.Reliable label inference: we will develop algorithms to refine labels learned through autonomous sensor data labeling or directly received from another source, to reliably infer target labels from uncertain and sporadic knowledge of a potentially unreliable and heterogeneous source. We will design adaptive non-parametric label propagation techniques that combine noisy labels with local observations of target to make reliable inferences.Robust model generation: we will investigate methods of training computational models that are robust to unknown parameters of source and adaptive to dynamically changing signal attributes. We will develop structured detection algorithms that take into account interdependency of physical/physiological events and known attributes of the application to accurately detect a wide range of health events.Validation in-the-wild: in addition to extensive in-lab testing, we will evaluate the proposed algorithms through in-field trials involving patients with heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and cancer.Broader Impacts. The various thrusts of this research will not only address the technical challenges in de-veloping highly performant and autonomous wearable systems, but will also enable actual monitoring of a variety of populations. This project has major broader impacts on conducting high-precision chronic disease management and on the availability of wearable-based consumer applications. In the medium-to-long-term, this will lead to the development of products and business around the concept of computational autonomy and its use in automation of health management and countless other yet un-envisioned applications. The PIs educational plan will focus on developing a new ambassador program to increase interest of under-represented minority community college students in STEM careers in general and in computer science and engineering careers in particular, developing a novel patron program to improve retention of transferred underrepresented minority students through student and parental exposure to wearable health research, en-gaging undergraduate students in research, and establishment of an interdisciplinary research-based curricu-lum on computational autonomy. The PI is committed to provide mentoring to graduate students as well as minorities; he is currently advising seven graduate students including four female students.Keywords: Wearable Computing, Self-Configuration, Machine Learning, Uncontrolled Environments.",
FP00031406,664,,,,,1,,,"Alzheimers disease (AD) can be viewed as a whole-body problem, although best characterized as a disease of the brain. There has been growing appreciation of the importance of the gut-liver-brain axis to AD, and dysfunctions in the liver and gut have been shown to interact with AD pathogenesis. Further, bioenergetic shifts involving fatty acid metabolism play a significant role in AD. The brain uses glucose as its primary fuel for energy production; however, reduced glucose transport and metabolism in the brain is an early and constant feature of AD. Under this energetic crisis, ketone bodies derived from fatty acids in the liver can be imported into the brain and used as the primary alternate fuel source. Consequently, development of AD may be influenced by whole-body fatty acid metabolism, rather than being an isolated condition of the brain.This proposal is inspired by our recent findings that decreased levels of a subset of fatty acids found in the brain, lauric acid in particular, correlate with AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. In addition, previous studies have shown the neuroprotective potential of coconut oil, in which lauric acid makes up ~50% of the fatty acids, on cognition and AD-related pathogenesis. However, mechanisms governing AD pathogenesis and its relationship to whole-body fatty acid metabolism are ill-defined.To at least partially address these fundamental gaps, we hypothesize that whole-body metabolic reprogramming, including fatty acid metabolism, is profoundly involved in AD development and progression. The overall objective of this study (short-term goal) is to further collect validation and mechanistic data in human subjects, and to establish whether 3xTg mice reproduce abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism along the gut-liver-brain axis, making them useful for exploration of mechanisms and testing of potential treatments. In Aim 1, we will validate dysregulated fatty acid metabolism in AD using a multi-omics approach on another independent sample set. Our working hypothesis is that decreased fatty acids levels in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD subjects will be accompanied by down-regulated fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and/or up-regulated fatty acid -oxidation (FAO), locally in the human brain. In Aim 2, we will determine AD-associated whole-body fatty acid metabolism and whether targeting it can intervene in AD using a mouse model. Our working hypothesis is that dysregulated fatty acid metabolism will exist along the gut-liver-brain axis, and that targeting those alterations through lauric acid supplementation can delay and/or alleviate AD pathogenesis.The expected outcomes include validation of our previous work in human tissues and the gain of additional insights into the mechanisms underlying whole-body fatty acid dysregulation in AD. Importantly, we will provide pre-clinical evidence establishing whether fatty acid supplementation can affect AD-associated outcomes. Successful implementation of this multidisciplinary study will lay the foundation for the future development of novel paradigms using lauric acid or other fatty acids to intervene in AD pathology in human subjects.",

FP00031417_Res1,666,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARYOver 200 million U.S. citizens live in areas with legal access to medical and recreational cannabis. Exposure to cannabisand its contaminants represents a potentially serious health risk to susceptible patients with neurological diseasesOrganophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid pesticides are common contaminants in cannabis and known human neurotoxicantswith potential links to Parkinsons disease (PD). However, due to the status of cannabis as an illicit Schedule I substanceat the federal level, there are no unified regulatory guidelines mitigating the health risk of exposure to pesticides incannabis. Parkinsons disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the U.S. Cannabis use is reportedin a higher rate (i.e. 25 - 40%) in PD patients than in the general population. Our overall objective is to determine theneurotoxic hazards of cannabis-borne pesticide exposure in PD patients at the molecular, organismal, and clinical levels.Our central hypothesis is that the combined effect of cannabis and pesticides can worsen the progression and prognosis ofPD, resulting in increased motor dysfunction and development of cognitive deficits We will pursue the following threespecific aims:Aim 1: To determine whether exposure to chlorpyrifos-contaminated -9 THC + CBD exacerbates dopaminergicdeficits and produces non-dopaminergic deficits in a rat PD model. We will test the hypothesis that exposure tochlorpyrifos-contaminated -9 THC + CBD will exacerbate the PD phenotype and also produce non-dopaminergicdeficits that may be characteristic of atypical PD.Aim 2: To examine the combined toxicity of different pesticides and cannabinoids in disrupting mitochondrialfunctions and neurotransmission in C. elegans and cell culture models. We hypothesize that co-exposure to -9 THC orCBD  both of which have antioxidant properties and affect mitochondrial respiration  will alter the dose-dependenteffect of pesticides on the key events in PD progression.Exploratory Aim 3: To characterize the exposure of individuals with PD to pesticides, THC, and CBD in cannabis andtheir knowledge regarding cannabis testing and state safety regulations. We will examine i.) cannabis use by individualswith PD and ii.) pesticide levels (including OP, pyrethroid, and other pesticides) and cannabinoid concentrations of thecannabis.This ViCTER Consortium is expected to provide crucial toxicity and exposure information to advance our understandingof the neurological hazard of pesticide residues in medical cannabis at the molecular, organismal, and clinical levels.Critically, it fills a key knowledge gap in the public health education and risk assessment of cannabis use, therebyinforming policy change to protect susceptible patient populations at the national level.",
FP00031419,667,,,,,1,,,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States and over two million stroke survivors have speech impairments, i.e. aphasia. Optimizing treatment for individuals with aphasia (IWA) is challenging because lesion size and acute aphasia severity do not strongly predict rehabilitation outcomes or optimal treatment protocols. However, specific mechanisms of speech production impairments in IWA are not yet well understood. Consequently, effectiveness of brain modulation techniques for treating IWA, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, is thus far inconclusive because we do not know where best to stimulate for treatment. There is a critical need to understand the specific neurological processes of sensorimotor integration of speech in order for more effective, subject-specific treatments for IWA to be developed. According to the Directions into Velocities of Articulators (DIVA) model, a prominent model of speech production, speech relies on two control subsystems: feedforward (FF) control, and feedback (FB) control to generate and optimize motor commands in speech respectively. These subsystems are thought to be supported by distinct, overlapping neural networks, though their specific contributions have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The objective of the current proposal is to investigate the neural contributions of feedback and feedforward mechanisms of motor speech control in individuals with aphasia. Previous studies indicate IWA may have less robust and/or FF and FB subsystems of speech production, but it is unknown if motor learning or re-learning of speech (as is often the case for individuals with aphasia) would be similarly affected. The central hypothesis of the current study is that FB and FF impairments of motor speech control dissociate in individuals with aphasia, thereby suggesting that la these subsystems contribute to speech production impairments in unique ways and are supported by distinct brain networks. To test this hypothesis, we will use a model-based behavioral paradigm, Altered Auditory Feedback (AAF). AAF allows us to explore relative contributions of the FF and FB subsystems by using auditory perturbation of the speaker's speech in real-time. We will then use lesion-symptom mapping to identify the brain regions associated with FF and/or FB speech impairments.  Experiments in Aim 1 will use auditory perturbation and model driven approaches to estimate FF and FB mechanisms to differentiate aphasia types and those in Aim 2 will explore critical neural substrates for FF and FB response patterns using structural MRI. Research training for the proposed study will take place at Arizona State University campus. Sponsor Rogalsky will mentor the PI in collecting and processing neuroimaging data in aphasia populations. Co-sponsor Daliri will mentor the PI in implementing and processing AAF behavioral data. The results of the current proposal have the potential to guide speech production treatments for IWA by identifying specific areas of impairment within the speech motor control system (FB or FF control) which will help identify distinct neurological targets for stimulation therapies, a currently untapped avenue for aphasia rehabilitation.",

FP00031438,669,,,,,1,,,"Project Abstract:  Research demonstrates that maladaptive eating (e.g., overeating, food restriction) and persistent depressive symptoms often co-occur and may reinforce each other over time. However, little is known regarding the etiology of early maladaptive eating and depressive symptoms among Mexican American children and how variations in cultural moderators impact the development of transdiagnostic dysfunctional mechanisms. Previous research suggests that Mexican American children who develop a stronger cultural orientation to Mexican practices (i.e., enculturation) may have better outcomes than those who develop a stronger orientation to U.S. practices (i.e., acculturation). This study aims to map early dysfunctional mechanisms between maladaptive eating and depressive symptoms across Mexican American child development, identify which specific symptoms are most influential to mechanisms driving dysfunction, and explore how enculturation (protective) and acculturation (risk) influence functional domains across childhood. My long-term research goal is to explore mental and physical illness trajectories among Hispanic populations to predict onset and course of illness and increase the effectiveness of mainstream interventions. Consistent with this goal, the current project proposes to use symptom network analysis to examine the development of maladaptive eating behaviors and depressive symptoms across a sample of 240 low-income Mexican American children assessed at ages 6, 7.5, and 9 years old. Grounded in the existing literature, I hypothesize that the association between maladaptive eating behaviors and depressive symptoms will become stronger across time. I also hypothesize that the symptoms most influential to dysfunctional mechanisms will remain consistent across time. Finally, I hypothesize that more enculturated Mexican American children will have less dysfunctional connections than more acculturated Mexican American children.  This will be the first study to examine maladaptive eatingdepression symptom networks among Mexican American children and the first to consider cultural development as a potential protective (enculturation) and risk (acculturation) factor of early dysfunction. Results will inform important etiological questions and identify optimal symptoms to target in treatment that can yield the most treatment gains for improving connections between maladaptive eating and depression in children. Completion of this research project and training plan will set the foundation for my early career program of research and provide clear next steps for important mechanisms and their corresponding environmental context to explore. The psychological, cultural, and statistical rigor of my training plan will prepare me to meet my goal of conducting research to predict onset and course of illness among Hispanic populations. I strongly believe that with the training from this fellowship, I will be an asset to the field of minority psychology and behavioral health. ",
FP00031460,670,,,,,1,,,"Title: Ethnoracial Disparities in Intergenerational Financial Support Exchanges and Young Adults Fulfillment of Bachelors Degree ExpectationsPrior research has shown that family socioeconomic status, typically operationalized as parents education or income, is the single most important predictor of young adults ability to achieve their college degree ambitions, with children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds being more likely to do so (Johnson & Reynolds, 2013). Due to a legacy of structural racism in the U.S., racially and ethnically minoritized families, namely Blacks and Latinos, on average, have access to dramatically fewer socioeconomic resources than white families, leading some scholars to conclude that group differences in childhood socioeconomic status explain ethnoracial disparities in the realization of postsecondary expectations (Boshara et al., 2015). However, these studies largely evaluate ethnoracial disparities in access to socioeconomic resources, rather than direct receipt of resources to support degree attainment. Further, this work assumes a unidirectional exchange of resources from parents to children, rather than explore exchanges of resources from children to parents. Therefore, the goals of this Spencer Foundation Small Research Grant are to explore whether and how racial and ethnic differences in intergenerational financial exchanges exacerbate or reduce ethnoracial disparities in young adults fulfillment of bachelor's degree expectations during the transition to adulthood using nationally representative data from Add Health.",
FP00031460_Res1,671,,,,,1,,,"Title: Ethnoracial Disparities in Intergenerational Financial Support Exchanges and Young Adults Fulfillment of Bachelors Degree ExpectationsPrior research has shown that family socioeconomic status, typically operationalized as parents education or income, is the single most important predictor of young adults ability to achieve their college degree ambitions, with children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds being more likely to do so (Johnson & Reynolds, 2013). Due to a legacy of structural racism in the U.S., racially and ethnically minoritized families, namely Blacks and Latinos, on average, have access to dramatically fewer socioeconomic resources than white families, leading some scholars to conclude that group differences in childhood socioeconomic status explain ethnoracial disparities in the realization of postsecondary expectations (Boshara et al., 2015). However, these studies largely evaluate ethnoracial disparities in access to socioeconomic resources, rather than direct receipt of resources to support degree attainment. Further, this work assumes a unidirectional exchange of resources from parents to children, rather than explore exchanges of resources from children to parents. Therefore, the goals of this Spencer Foundation Small Research Grant are to explore whether and how racial and ethnic differences in intergenerational financial exchanges exacerbate or reduce ethnoracial disparities in young adults fulfillment of bachelor's degree expectations during the transition to adulthood using nationally representative data from Add Health.",

FP00031498,675,,,,,1,,,"Developing new approaches for obtaining accurate estimates of dietary intake is crucial for revealing true associations between dietary intakes and disease risk, with the ultimate aim of establishing evidence-based guidelines. While the evidence on dietary sugars and increased risks of dental caries and obesity have been stronger, the association between sugars and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cancer remains inconclusive. The findings on total and animal protein (AP) intake in relation to T2D risk and CVD or all-cause mortality have also been inconsistent. Dietary biomarkers alleviate the problem of measurement errors (ME) associated with self-reporting dietary instruments commonly used in nutritional epidemiology, and have been used to validate and calibrate self-reported diet or to adjust for ME in self-reports, and reveal important associations. In the parent project of this renewal application, (SugarsBio study, U01-CA197902), we confirmed  24-h urinary sucrose and fructose (24uSF) as a predictive biomarker of total sugars (TS) intake, and demonstrated the transportability of the biomarker equation for estimating biomarker-based TS intake and its use across different populations. Furthermore, we have identified serum carbon isotope ratio (CIR) as a candidate predictive biomarker of the AP to total protein intake ratio (APR), a novel biomarker of protein quality, and developed a biomarker equation that can be used to generate biomarker-based APR in studies with available biological samples. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the utility and application of 24uSF and serum CIR biomarkers in diverse populations in two prospective cohorts. For this purpose, we will leverage data from two large dietary validation studies with comprehensive validation protocols (IDATA and SOLNAS) nested within cohorts, the NIH-AARP Diet and Health (AARP) Study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). First, we will study the ME in self-reported TS, and APR, AP and plant protein (PP) intake, using 24uSF and serum CIR biomarkers. Second, we will develop regression calibration equations for self-reported intake, based on biomarkers, in IDATA and SOLNAS that we will apply in their respective cohorts. Third, we will investigate uncalibrated and calibrated (i.e., ME-corrected) self-reported intakes of TS, AP, PP and APR in relation to CVD mortality in the AARP, and T2D risk in the HCHS/SOL cohort. We hypothesize that the magnitude of diet-disease association is stronger for calibrated dietary intakes than those of uncalibrated intakes. Our study will be the first study that applies the newly developed US population-based sugars and protein intake biomarkers and their calibration equations to race/ethnically diverse US population-based studies and evaluates ME-corrected dietary intakes in relation to chronic diseases. By informing the best practices for applying these biomarkers in future diet validation studies and studies of diet-disease associations, this proposal will significantly contribute to improving dietary assessments and enhancing scientific rigor of nutritional epidemiologic studies.",
FP00031501,676,,,,,1,,,"If the proposal is funded, we commit to carrying out NMR spectroscopic studies of the structure and dynamics of MMP1, involving the following activities. 1.We will collect NMR data on the putative substrates, A beta and alpha-synuclein, and the enzyme, MMP1.2.We will compare the collected data to published data and if there are discrepancies work with investigators to resolve possible differences in sample preparation conditions.3.We will most likely concentrate on Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) 1H,15N spectra for MMP1 in the presence and absence of substrates. We expect a crosspeak for each hydrogen attached to a nitrogen in the sample. By looking for chemical shift changes in the HSQC, we will be able to obtain residue position level information on where the local environment is perturbed by ligands and substrates. 4.We will use published assignments to look for changes in the HSQC spectra induced by different substrates and ligands. Additional perturbations may be studied as needed and time/resources permitting.  5.We will measure R1 and R2 relaxation rates and HetNOE in order to quantify potential changes in protein dynamics. 6.We expect that any changes in chemical shift and/or dynamics will be easily identifiable with a specific residue based on the original assignment but in case there is a change in conformation that so drastically alters protein structure that the original assignment is no longer valid, we will carry out new assignments for the altered conformation using standard triple resonance experiments, assignment and structure calculation. Because of the large size of the protein, this will require the Trosy version of these experiments. 7.In case we find only chemical shift changes in the linker region, we will introduce paramagnetic labels at S366C or S142C using the unique chemistry of the cysteine side chain for specific attachment. We are very experienced in this type of labeling and ensuring 100% labeling efficiency. We will use nitroxide labels in which the free electron induces loss of 1H signals through paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) up to 35 away. 8.For stability reasons, we will use the catalytically inactive E219Q mutant to avoid autoproteolysis, which has shown to be stable for several months and allows collection of data at elevated temperature. However, we may need to move to studying the WT in case the independence of hpx and cat domain structures is an artifact of the cat domain point mutation E219Q. 9.Study of the WT may result in very messy spectra due to autoproteolysis. If this is the case, we may need to resolve to time-resolved NMR spectroscopy. We may need to sacrifice information content for time-resolution and focus on the most important positions. 10.We will investigate the suitability of amyloid fibrils as orientation media to obtain residual dipolar couplings for MMP1. This will allow us to identify the relative orientation of the hemopexin domain with respect to the catalytic domain. We will compare the amyloid fibrils with different established methods of orientations such as virus particles and lipid nanodisks.11.We will also investigate the reverse effect of MMP1 on substrate. For this, substrate will be isotope labeled and studied in the presence of unlabeled MMP1. This will either be done within the NMR tube if the substrate is soluble, or outside if it is insoluble. In the latter case, substrates will be centrifuged to selectively study only soluble material, for example small peptide fragments that get released from large aggregated fibrillar material.12.We will establish collaborations with the Barrow Neurological Institute investigators Yonas Geda and Marwan Sabbagh to prepare samples for MMP1 proteolysis using authentic Alzheimer plaques.",
FP00031543,677,,,,,1,,,"Recent evidence suggests middle-age and older adults (MA+) with ASD are more likely to be diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers disease compared to neurotypical (NT) adults; yet, understanding of cognitive and brain aging with ASD is lacking. Our preliminary data show accelerated longitudinal decline of memory and hippocampal volume in MA+ ASD, compared to NT, which builds on cross-sectional evidence of cognitive and brain aging vulnerabilities in ASD. In our community-based sample, adults with ASD are more likely to carry the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele, which is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease. Our long-term goal is to inform precision medicine for neurodegenerative and accelerated cognitive aging in ASD. The specific aims are to: 1) evaluate adults with ASD for enrichment of Alzheimers disease-related polygenic risk score, and 2) evaluate Alzheimers Disease polygenic risk scores as a moderator of accelerated cognitive and brain decline in MA+ ASD, compared to matched NT adults. Our study design will use our ongoing, well-characterized longitudinal cohort of MA+ ASD (without intellectual disability) and MA+ NT who receive cognitive and MRI batteries every two-years (n=121, ages 40-75, mean=55.2 years; M:F ratio 1.6:1), and our young adult cross-sectional comparison cohort (n=101, ages 18-39, mean=24.2 years). Participant DNA will be genotyped on a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism global microarray with an additional 180K neurodegenerative disease markers, then imputed for whole genome coverage. We will use longitudinal mixed effects models to detect a diagnosis group (ASD vs. NT) by Alzheimers Disease polygenic risk scores interaction on dependent variables (e.g. short-term memory, long-term memory, and bilateral hippocampal volume). Our expected outcomes are to identify Alzheimers disease risk genetics that are: 1) enriched in adults with ASD, and 2) contribute to accelerated cognitive and brain aging in MA+ ASD. This is relevant to public health because we are identifying genomic underpinnings of age-related brain health declines in a vulnerable population that may be targeted with precision medicine.",
FP00031574,678,,,,,1,,,"The purpose of this research project is to validate the Dyslexia Screening Questionnaire-Spanish Bilingual version (DYSQ-SB) completed by parents in conjunction with their childs 6-year old pediatric well-check visit. The purpose of the questionnaire is to identify children who are at risk for dyslexia, a developmental reading disability. Up to 20% of children are impacted by dyslexia. Without early detection and treatment, dyslexia can have devastating effects on a childs academic performance and socio-emotional well-being. Although pediatricians routinely screen for a multitude of early childhood developmental milestones at well visits, there is currently no validated screening tool for dyslexia for physician use. Because many children in the U.S. speak Spanish as their home language, it is important to validate both English and Spanish questionnaires. In the current project we will validate the Spanish version. Hispanic children represent the largest minority within the United States, emphasizing the need to create a DYSQ screener in Spanish. For this study, 150 Spanish-speaking families will be recruited from the Phoenix metropolitan area through a collaboration with Phoenix Childrens Hospital and the Phoenix Childrens Health Network, a group of pediatric practices affiliated with the hospital. The study will consist of four parts:1.Parents complete the DYSQ-SB for their child2.Our research team evaluates the child to determine whether they have dyslexia based on gold-standard testing3.Our research team analyzes results from the screener and gold standard testing to identify questions on the questionnaire most predictive of dyslexia4.Our research team revises the questionnaire based on these results to form a shorter, valid questionnaire5.Our research team applies for additional funding to run a fully powered study to determine data-based cut off scores for the screener for both English and Spanish groups in the U.S.  In its final form, the DYSQ-SB will be about a 10-minute parent questionnaire completed immediately prior to 6-year-old childrens well visit with their pediatrician. Long term, the goal is to have the DYSQ-SB screening become the national standard of care for 6-year-old wellness check visits.",
FP00031584,679,,,,,1,,,"In sub-Saharan areas of Africa, many countries have limited healthcare facilities that provide urgent and emergent care and maternal and child health. Most health care in rural and remote areas is provided by nurses or nurse practitioners, who are located at a distance from regional hospitals. People struggle to determine whether they should seek medical attention, since travel and ultimate cost of treatment requires considerable effort and can negatively affect financial stability.  In order to assess factors affecting healthcare decision-making and clinical practice, we propose an eight-month feasibility study involving rapid ethnography with medical stakeholders in Zimbabwe, information systems literature review and a participatory design component. The study will identify opportunities and envision alternatives to make health information accessible using technology and best practices. This process will improve access to care and help provide quality outcomes for the most resource-constrained parts of the population. The ultimate goal is to establish a normalized model of healthcare delivery for use by governments and NGOs across the Sub-Saharan region. Background:Zimbabwe is a predominantly rural (68%), resource-constrained country and about the size of Montana.  Major health challenges include malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and maternal and child health. Declining economic conditions and rising costs of living, intertwined with social and political upheaval from its colonial and post-colonial reckonings, have eroded a health system once known regionally for its well-educated, robust workforce and ability to provide advanced medical care. Despite these challenges, Zimbabwe has a better distribution of nurses and midwives, estimates of national immunization coverage for children and antenatal care than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major source of strain in the health care system including drug and other supply chain shortages In Zimbabwe. There is an active COVID-19 immunization program, but poor rollout to rural areas and urban townships, due in part to poor communication between sites. USAID has been instrumental in providing ventilators for COVID-19 and calling for the study of health care supply chains. The Zimbabwean government is actively seeking solutions to enhance the use of health information that will result in improved medical outcomes over an individuals lifespan. As a result, we propose a research plan aimed at better understanding the countrys clinical context and key health information needs for patients, providers, and the health system.",
FP00031589,680,,,,,1,,,"Most athletes report the use of nutritional supplements 1, and such use comes with the risk of unintended doping as supplements may contain banned substances.2,3 A positivedoping test, as the result of using a contaminated nutritional supplement, could leadto negative consequences on health, or suspension or even expulsion from sport 4,resulting in loss of sponsorship, income, and previous achievements. It may alsodamage relationships with friends, family, and support personnel, as well aspermanently affect the athletes reputation and credibility, which are important forfuture career prospects. Although the use of certified third-party tested supplements isconsidered a safe alternative to not using nutritional supplements 5, our data suggestthat supplements are tremendously popular, and 50-80% of athletes still use uncertifiedsupplements 6,7, regardless of strict liability for drug negative tests instituted by(inter)national sport organizations. Currently, a major obstacle in the field ofinadvertent anti-doping is that there are very few data available about athletesattitudes and barriers that would predict the use or non-use of certified third-partytested supplements.8 It is, therefore, difficult to target specific athletes that need moreor different types of education on the topic of safe nutritional supplement use.To solve this problem, we propose a three-part project that will begin with examiningathlete attitudes and result in tangible tools which sport organizations can use to reducethe risk of their athletes making poor nutritional supplement choices.The specific aims and hypotheses of this research project are:1) Present elite athletes with a questionnaire, with high content validity, to determinetheir knowledge of, attitudes toward, and motivations for using third-party testedproducts, as well as barriers to their use and their access to their sport organizationsnutrition resources and services. We can then identify responses that predict the use ornon-use of certified third-party tested nutritional supplements. These predictiverelationships will help programs identify athletes at risk and tailor interventions toincrease athletes use of third-party tested supplements and reduce the use of riskyproducts. To our knowledge, this will be the first athlete survey that will allow such acritically important prediction.Hypotheses: Athletes that buy principally third-party tested products will 1) havehigher supplement knowledge survey scores and 2) report more positive attitudestoward and motivations for third-party tested products than those that mainlybuy supplements that are not third-party tested.2) Receive and examine each participating sport organizations educationalprogramming and materials concerning dietary supplements, then relate this content tothe athletes knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of certified third-party tested anduntested supplements. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic attempt to examinethe nature of educational materials available to athletes, and the first attempt to relatethe nature of that material to their compliance with using safe products.Hypotheses: Amount and depth of educational 280 materials regarding third-party testing will be positively related to a) knowledge about, b) attitudes andmotivations toward, and c) use of third-party tested supplements.3) From this collective information, we will first develop a short screening questionnaireto identify risky nutritional supplement behavior and validate this tool by comparing itsanswers with a much lengthier face-to-face structured interview. This interview will bebased on the common standardized multiple pass 24-hour dietary recall method thatnormally is used by Sports RDs, but it will now be used to obtain insight into nutritionalsupplement behavior of athletes. Although sports nutrition has been effectivelyintegrated into the field of sports performance, the availability of sports RDs to athletesis often limited.9 This new screening tool will make it easier for other healthprofessionals working in sports, as well as sports RDs, to target education for theathletes that are the most in need. Second, we will advise departments on efficienteducational material, determined by the relationship between educational content andathlete use of certified supplements.

FP00031591,681,,,,,1,,,"Opioid overdose deaths & suicide rates are higher among Arizonans than the national average (CDC, 2021), despite comparable prevalence rates of substance use disorders and mental illness (SAMHSA, 2021). These discrepancies are exaggerated among Native Americans (NAs). NAs are 20% more likely to die from drug-induced deaths than the state average, 40% more likely to die by suicide, & 500% more likely to experience alcohol-induced deaths, resulting in a median age at death that is almost 15 years younger than the AZ median (ADHS, 2021).    These differences are due, in part, to a lack of equitable access to healthcare. NAs are one of the most underserved populations in the U.S. In 2019, only 13.9% of NAs received mental health services, compared to 19.8% of Non-Hispanic Whites (SAMHSA, 2020). The ASU Graduate Psychology Training Consortium (GPTC) will improve Native American access to behavioral health (BH) services by implementing a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, culturally-informed, state-of-the-science training program on Integrated Health (IH) and Opioid & other Substance Use Disorder (O/SUD) treatment via Telehealth.    The GPTC assembles experts from 5 ASU programs (Clinical Psychology, Counseling Psychology, Integrated Behavioral Health, Social Work, and Nursing), as well as NA consultants with expertise in improving health and wellness of Indigenous People, to develop an interdisciplinary, didactic training curriculum infused with a Native American Perspective and Cultural Considerations. Further, the GPTC will leverage telehealth services, with training support from the HRSA-funded Southwest Telehealth Resource Center (SWTRC), to virtually place trainees in IH programs at two community-based, primary-care experiential training sites located in rural AZ. The majority of clients served by these agencies are Native American.  Training Objectives: 1. To improve access to quality BH by training clinical & counseling psychology graduate students (4 per year, 12 total) who are committed to working in high need/high demand areas. Recruiting diverse students is a priority. This objective also addresses the HHS/HRSA clinical priority of improving mental health access & care. 2. To provide didactic training in interdisciplinary, team-based Integrated Health, O/SUD & other BH services, and Telehealth services, with emphasis on social determinants of health, culturally-appropriate service delivery, trauma-informed care, and provider resiliency. Training will be provided by faculty from the 5 collaborating ASU programs, NA consultants, and SWTRC.   3. To provide experiential training, through telehealth, at two community-based, primary care settings, that provide integrated, interdisciplinary BH in high need/high demand areas. Two community healthcare centers have agreed to offer practicums (1 is a HPSA site, 1 is contracted with Indian Health Services). Their IH teams include medical doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, and addiction counselors. 4. To provide experiential training in O/SUD prevention, treatment, & recovery services. Both practicum sites will include O/SUD treatment, MAT, & SBIRT services. At least 25% of trainee clinical services will be dedicated to O/SUD treatment. This objective also addresses the HHS/HRSA clinical priority of ending the crisis of opioid addiction and overdose in America. 5. To increase Telehealth services that will improve access to psychological services at the experiential training sites. Didactic training will be available through live distance-learning & recorded-video modalities. This objective also addresses the HHS/HRSA clinical priority of strengthening health care access through telehealth. 6. To enhance faculty and practitioner development, training faculty will cross-train on all topics. Didactic trainings will also be open to all students and faculty from the 5 collaborating ASU programs, and clinical providers at the experiential sites. ",

Midlife adults are one of the most highly sedentary demographic groups, with a disproportionate amount of daily occupational and leisure sedentary time compared to other age groups. Midlife and older adults spend 11.2+2.1h/d sedentary, and a dose-response relationship exists between SB and successful aging. A common change is midlife is marriage and/or committing to a partner. This can afford protective health benefits later in life, dependent on quality of and satisfaction with the relationship. Cohabitating couples, or dyads, often demonstrate synchronous behaviors including sedentary time, with greater synchrony associated with greater feelings of closeness and well-being between partners. Understanding of dyad sedentary time through multimodal assessment of SB, and identifying correlates of midlife adult dyad SB is limited in existing literature. Examination of these constructs will aid in identification of unique dyad SB profiles that may inform couples-based interventions designed to reduce SB.This study will investigate dyad SB using activPAL devices through multimodal measurement of total minutes, bout duration and frequency, type of behavior while sedentary, and synchrony of behaviors. Additionally, potential individual, dyadic, and environmental correlates of midlife adult dyad SB will be assessed. The proposed observational study will use latent profile analysis to identify dyad SB profiles and examine multilevel correlates of these profiles from a sample of midlife dyads (N=300; 150 dyads) from the Stand and Move and Work II study (SMWII, R01CA250527 MPIs Buman [Co-Sponsor] & Pereira).

FP00031597,684,,,,,1,,,"This proposal aims to measure the microscale dynamics of human sweat evaporation and identify the main underlying physical mechanisms. While evaporation has been rigorously studied in various contexts, sweating presents a unique set of complexities (e.g., textured and soft exterior skin surface with varied gland density and activity). To systematically understand the contribution of these factors, we propose a two-pronged transdisciplinary approach that merges physiological and engineering perspectives. First, we will develop a new method that integrates ventilated capsule sweat rate measurements used routinely in physiology with multimodal imaging. Specifically, we will use fast macro videography (60-120 Hz), midwave infrared thermography that yields moderately fast surface images (5-25 Hz), and optical coherence tomography that produces slower (~0.3 Hz) 3D images of external as well as internal structures (e.g., resolves spiral sweat ducts in epidermis). We will use this non-invasive method to simultaneously measure sweat evaporation rate and visualize the corresponding microscale sweat dynamics at three skin sites. We will study these processes under neutral, moderate, and strong thermal stimuli that we assert will induce out-of-pore, dropwise, and filmwise sweating modes. Second, we will determine the contributions of various factors to sweat evaporation through experimentation and modeling employing the same method but with artificial sweating surfaces with gradually increasing complexity.",

Therefore, physical rehabilitation has become the primary approach to improve this symptom. Indeed, rehabilitation can, in some cases, improve function, however the impact of this approach can also be modest and variable. Given the importance of rehabilitation as they key tool to improve mobility in people with PD, it is critical to conduct research aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of this approach. Recent work has identified Action Observation Therapy (AOT), often in conjunction with Motor Imagery (MI) as a key tool to improve effectiveness of physical rehabilitation. AOT+MI allows patients to watch an instructor make the movements, then imagine completing those movements prior to practicing the task themselves. Viewing these movements prior to practice can activate specific and important neural networks that may amplify the effect of training. Recent technological advancements such as virtual reality (VR) can allow viewing movements in a much more immersive way. As such VR could facilitate additional benefit to AOT+MI approaches. As an additional benefit, VR is highly engaging and can increase the adherence to therapy regimens. However, whether VR impacts the effectiveness of AOT+MI training in people with PD is unknown. This project will fill this important research gap. In doing so, we will improve our understanding of how technology can be integrated into therapy, thereby improving the ability of clinicians to treat mobility deficits in people with PD.",

IT and healthcare are essential to Arizonas resilience and recovery, given demographic data on growing healthcare needs and cross-industry growth in IT occupations due to acceleration of the digital transformation during the pandemic. As Arizona experiences aboveaverage population growth and outpaces the nation in jobs growth, Arizonans have uneven access to education and career pathways essential to enter high-quality jobs. These sectors require relatively high levels of postsecondary attainment, yet enrollment and attainment are declining in Arizona.

FP00031659,691,,,,,1,,,"The parent-adult child dyad is one of the most consequential and enduring ties across the lifespan. Due to the lengthened transition to adulthood among adult children, or delays in completing a college degree, living independently, finding a full-time job, and getting married, the period of overlap between the lives of parents and adult children has increased (Vespa, 2017). Therefore, adult children may be more dependent on their parents for financial, emotional, and instrumental support (Fingerman et al., 2009). The increasing life expectancy of parents and the gendered division of labor in caregiving, have brought to light the increasing interdependence between aging parents and adult children in the U.S. The overall objective of this project is to use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and the Add Health Parent Study (n=1,701 parent-adult child dyads) to examine the interdependent nature of parents and adult childrens onset of a serious chronic health condition on the mental and physical health of each member of the parent-adult child dyad. The central hypothesis is that that the onset and earlier timing of a serious chronic health condition among parents will be associated with worse physical and mental health among adult children, and vice versa. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1a: Determine whether an adult childs onset and timing of a serious chronic health condition (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease) is associated with improvements or declines in their parents mental and physical health. Aim 1b: Determine whether a parents onset and timing of a serious chronic health condition (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease) is associated with improvements or declines in their adult childrens mental and physical health. Aim 2: Determine whether stress and financial strain are mechanisms that explain why parents and adult childrens onset of a serious chronic health condition may impact the mental and physical health of each member of the parent-adult child dyad. Aim 3: Determine whether gender, educational attainment, or social support are key moderators impacting the association of the onset of a serious chronic health condition and the mental and physical health of each member of the parent-adult child dyad. We will use multilevel modeling and actor-partner interdependence modeling to conduct the research aims. The proposed project is promises to have a positive impact on population health by informing interventions and policies to improve the mental and physical health among parent-adult child dyads in the U.S. These policies include those surrounding financial transfers, paid family leave, and paid caregiving. Results from our project will shed light on the interdependency of the parent-adult child tie, such as how the timing of a serious chronic health condition impacts the mental and physical health of the parent-adult child dyad. The outcomes will lead to a better understanding of the chronic conditions that most impact the health of parents and their adult children.",

Third, we will determine key moderators contributing to the relationship between chronic conditions experienced and the health of the mother-adult child dyad. The central hypothesis is that that the onset and earlier timing of a serious chronic health condition among mothers will be associated with worse physical and mental health among adult children, and vice versa. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1a: Estimate the magnitude of the effect of an adult childs onset and timing of a serious chronic health condition on their mothers mental and physical health. Aim 1b: Estimate the magnitude of the effect of a mothers onset and timing of a serious chronic health condition on their adult childs mental and physical health. Aim 2: Determine whether stress and financial strain are mechanisms that explain why adult children and mothers onset of a serious chronic condition may impact the mental and physical health of each member of the mother-adult child dyad. Aim 3: Determine whether gender, education, social support, and childrens transitions to adulthood (living independently, becoming a parent, and employment), are key moderators impacting the association of the onset of a serious chronic health condition and the mental and physical health of each member of the mother-adult child dyad. We will use multilevel modeling and actor-partner interdependence modeling to conduct the research aims. The proposed R01 is significant, because it will have a positive impact on population health by informing interventions and policies to improve health among mother-adult child dyads in the U.S. These policies include those surrounding financial transfers, paid family leave, and paid caregiving. Results from our project will shed light on the interdependency of the mother-adult child tie, such as how the timing of a serious chronic health condition impacts the mental and physical health of both adult children and their mothers. The outcomes will lead to a better understanding of the types and timing of serious chronic diseases that most impact the well-being of mothers and their adult children.",

FP00031665,694,,,,,1,,,"Incontinence, whether it is urinary or fecal, drastically reduces quality of life. People suffering from it often feel ashamed and it is rare that people admit to it  a notable exception being the pop star Zara Larsson who has publicly stated that she used a diaper for seven years in order to raise awareness for incontinence. Not surprisingly, the estimates of prevalence vary widely from 1 in 10 to 1 in 3 people [Who]. It is more prevalent in elderly, and in females, and it is associated with depression and increasesthe need for care, increasing the rate of admission to nursing homes and hospitals [Who]. Current solutions depend on the type of incontinence but can only be fully cured in some cases. In untreated or untreatable cases, diapers and enema devices are necessary to prevent and collect leakage and clean out bowels. Discomfort, accidents and accidental damage to tissue and infections make these solutions less than ideal. Here, we propose two complementary technical approaches to overcome some of these challenges. First, we will develop a sensor aimed at predicting when a person will need to use thebathroom. The sensor will detect changes in abdominal girth and bowel urgency. Such a device would be the first non-invasive early warning system for incontinence and would allow users more freedom of movement and ease of mind. Second, we propose to improve current enema designs by creating a soft device that is less likely to leak or cause damage, enhance comfort and can easily be washed.",
FP00031668,695,,,,,1,,,"Dyslexia is a neuro-cognitive developmental learning disorder that negatively impacts a childs ability to read words accurately and fluently despite normal intelligence, competent reading instruction, and appropriate sociocultural learning opportunities. It is characterized by specific dysfunctions in the areas of phonological processing, spelling, and/or rapid visual-verbal naming. Estimates regarding the incidence of dyslexia range from 5%-17% (Ozernov-Palchik & Gaab, 2016; Tasman et al., 2015). The estimated range of incidence is wide due in part to under-identification of dyslexia and to varying standards used for diagnosis (Ozernov-Palchik & Gaab, 2016). Short-term consequences of dyslexia include poor academic achievement, anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression (Undheim, 2011). Only 62% of students with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia graduate from high school in the U.S., with rates as low as 23% in some states (National Center for Education Statistics, 2013). Up to 50% of delinquents have dyslexia (Selenius & Hellstrm, 2015), and in juvenile delinquents the prevalence of dyslexia is reported to be as high as 57% (Snowling et al., 2000). The long-term effects of dropping out of school include limited employment opportunities, poor health outcomes (Egerter et al., 2009), and lower life expectancy (Begier, Li, & Meduro, 2013). Intervention can improve both the short-term and the long-term outcomes of children with dyslexia (Bogan, 2014), with early intervention being more effective than later intervention due to late identification (van der Leij, 2013). This proposal addresses the critical clinical challenge that many children are diagnosed with dyslexia too late to optimally benefit from intervention. Although pediatricians routinely screen for many developmental milestones, no validated screening tool is available for dyslexia in their practices and formal training in this arena is largely absent from general pediatric training programs. Instead, the general pediatric community relies on the public education system to identify children with dyslexia. Ironically, often the public education system relies on the pediatric community to facilitate the formal diagnosis of dyslexia.",
FP00031680,696,,,,,1,,,"The Sensorimotor Development Research Laboratory at Arizona State University in partnership with Theracycle and key stakeholders will complete a product development project. The goal of this project is to develop and pilot test a pediatric version of a current specialized stationary bicycle that has a motor that can be turned on to deliver Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) in which the mechanical motor moves the pedals at least 35% faster than the participant can during voluntary cycling. Previous research with an adult version of this Assisted Cycle Therapy bicycle has shown improvements in some cognitive, motor, physical and mental health measures in adolescents and older adults with neurological disabilities. This technology will overcome the major obstacles to conventional pediatric exercise because it reduces some of the low motivation/ adherence and physical limitations of other exercise options (e.g., weight training, swimming, running, etc.). Furthermore, it is the only therapy to date suggested to induce neurological changes that lead to improvements in cognitive function which are crucial for improving independence and self-sufficiency in society. There are two objectives: (1) to develop a pediatric version of the current bicycle used for ACT by Theracycle with modifications and flexibility to adjust for shorter leg lengths, shorter arms and bodies of young children thus laying the foundation for translation to broad clinical applications and early interventions. (2) to pilot test the effectiveness of the pediatric Theracycle on 10 young children (5-12) with Down syndrome in a laboratory based study. The innovative strategies utilized in this project lie in both the mechanical motor in the bicycle and its importance for early intervention in pediatric neurologic populations. Based on our previous research with several different adult neurological populations, our anticipated outcomes include improvements in executive function, fine and gross motor control, activities of daily living, adaptive behavior, and depression, among others. This early intervention is likely to improve full potential leading to more inclusion and integration into society, employment, independent living and quality of life for people born with neurological disorders, specifically Down syndrome. The expected product is a more accessible, convenient, cost-effective, and eventually widespread clinical application of a pediatric version of the Theracycle to deliver Assisted Cycle Therapy as an early intervention in many pediatric neurological populations.",
FP00031789,697,,,,,1,,,"HCC: Medium: Designing and Building an Intelligent Wearable System for Precise At-home Physical Therapy  Overview Recent technological advances, especially those for supporting continuous acquisition of personal health data, seem to suggest that precision health would soon become a reality, even in a home environment. Yet, careful examination reveals that there are still many significant barriers in practice. Physical therapy has been routinely used in prevention and treatment of chronic low back pain, a significant heath issue. However, presently there is no technology to reliably monitor compliance, ensure correctness, and track progress  for  unsupervised  physical  therapy  at  home.  We  identify  two  key  technical  challenges  that impede  the  development  of  good  solutions  in  this  main:  the  system  challenge  and  the  inference challenge. To address these challenges, we take a design-driven approach in building a novel wearable system  (addressing  the  first  challenge),  complete  with  innovative  machine  learning  techniques (addressing  the  second  challenge),  for  achieving  precise  at-home  physical  therapy  in  the  domain  of chronic low back pain. Our specific goal is to design, develop and pilot-test a novel wearable system, with integrated  hardware  (system)  and  software  (algorithms),  for  supporting  and  improving  unsupervised physical therapy at home, taking into consideration usability factors such as feedback mechanisms. The project exemplifies general design and engineering principles in developing realistic solutions overcoming practical barriers in more general precision health contexts.   Keywords:  Precision  health;  Physical  Therapy;  Wearable  System;  Machine/Deep  Learning;  Human-centered Computation; Spatiotemporal Models.  Intellectual Merit Although  technological  advances  have  made  it  possible  to  bring  personal  health  devices  to  the  home, much more research is needed to increase the precision of these systems to provide specific therapeutic benefits at home. The proposed work will bridge a significant knowledge gap in precise at-home physical therapy for treatment and prevention of chronic low back pain, which is a significant health risk to society. Our  research  efforts  will  advance  knowledge  and  practice  in  the  domains  of  wearable  systems  for healthcare,  embedded  machine  learning/artificial  intelligence,  unsupervised  physical  therapy,  and  user behavior with personal health devices. Considering the nature of the problem, we employ a design-driven approach by explicitly addressing all aspects of the effort through innovative designs. The innovations in the  proposed  project  collectively  contribute  to  building  a  realistic  system  for  addressing  a  real-world problem.  The  investigators  have  on-going  research  efforts  preparing  the  team  for  addressing  the challenges of the proposed work, including studies that form the foundation and preliminary work for key components of the proposed approaches. The unique composition of the team ensures that we have the right mixture of expertise for pursuing the proposed efforts.  Broader Impacts  The proposed research will have broad impact  on  the development  of  intelligent wearable systems  for precision health in the general domain of at-home healthcare and in the specific domain of precise at-home  physical  therapy  for  chronic  low  back  pain.  Because  of  the  increasing  adoption  of  personal healthcare devices, the potential impact of the proposed research is evident as it exemplifies the design and engineering principles for developing solutions in such a context. The work will also contribute to the larger-scope  mission of precision health by demonstrating how technical and practical  barriers may be overcome  through  innovative  design  and  development  of  new  systems.  The  proposed  research  will impact education in three ways. First, students will be recruited and trained for both research and for user studies, and thus exposing them to the leading edge of building innovative healthcare devices. Second, the  research  will  expand,  through  providing  real-world  examples,  our  existing  curriculum  on  machine learning, signal processing, human-computer interaction, and exercise science, further contributing to the investigators educational  activities. Third, besides reporting our research findings on scholarly venues, we will publicize our research outcomes via the project website and other social media channels, with the goal of improving the publics understanding of technical advances for at-home healthcare applications.

FP00031854,698,,,,,1,,,"Overview:  Project Summary Acquired  brain  injury  (e.g.,  stroke)  is  a  leading  cause  of  long-term  disability  and  mobility  deficits. Rehabilitation  plays  a  critical  role  for  stroke  patients  to  regain  ambulatory  functions,  but  conventional rehabilitation  with  therapists  can  be  labor-intensive,  expensive,  and  inaccessible.  Robotic  rehabilitation holds a strong potential, but existing solutions have not satisfied the clinical needs since they often lack customizability  to  different  patients,  the  adaptability  to  learn  user  preferences,  or  the  intelligence  to collaborate with therapists. This project introduces Trilateral Collaboration  - a new approach to human-robot  interaction  that  enables  tight  coordination  and  information  flow  between  partners  with  varying capabilities,  i.e.,  patients,  therapists  and  assistive  robots.  In  contrast  to  previous  approaches,  trilateral collaboration turns the assistive robot into a member of the healthcare team that is responsive to both the physical demands of the patient, as well the demonstrations and corrective feedback of the therapist. The presented  approach  maintains  the  central  role  of  physical  therapists  in  the  therapeutic  process.  The objectives of this project are realized through critical innovations in the integrative design of interaction-aware soft robotic exosuit, user interface design to send and receive feedback from therapists, and robot learning  algorithms  for  autonomous  adjustment  of  robot  assistance.  Twenty-four  stroke  patients  will  be recruited  to  assess  the  feasibility,  safety,  and  effectiveness  of  the  exosuit  system  via  an  integrative  and iterative design loop between clinicians and engineers. Key words: soft robotics, human-robot interaction, rehabilitation Intellectual Merit:  This project re-envisions the therapeutic process through the bottom-up development of an integrated set of algorithms, interfaces and hardware technologies that enable a novel Trilateral Collaboration between a physical therapist, a patient and a soft robotic assistant. Towards this goal, the transformative contribution is three fold: 1) Multimodal Triadic Policies (MTP) -- a unified Bayesian learning framework that is capable of modelling such triangular relationships in order to determine when and how to support the patient. MTPs can be directly trained from physical demonstrations of the therapist, or through incremental feedback and learning signals provided via a novel user-interface. 2) An interaction-aware, inflatable exosuit design. The exosuit features fabric and bistable actuators to support antagonistic muscle movement, and soft sensors to measure  physical  interaction  between  a  patient  and  therapist.  3)  User  interface  design  for  therapists  to receive biofeedback, adjust the robot assistance, and label abnormal gait patterns for hemiparetic. This way, teaching, learning and correction is performed in a therapist-in-the-loop fashion that allows for careful and considerate improvements of the system behavior. Instead of replacing healthcare practitioners, this project empowers  therapists  by  putting  physical  strength,  sensing  and  learning  of  a  robot  collaborator  at  their disposal. Broader Impacts:  Stroke-related costs in the US came close to $46 billion in 2014, and it is estimated that there could be as many as 70 million stroke survivors worldwide by 2030. The developed soft robotic exosuit system enables safe, precise and personalized rehabilitation training of stroke survivors to regain functional independence at a lower cost. This device would also allow therapists to safely initiate tasks earlier in the rehab training which  can  help  mitigate  potential  compensatory  strategies,  facilitate  neuromuscular  re-education,  and reduce overall lengths of inpatient rehab stays. Moreover, the low costs of soft exosuits enable robot-aided gait training at home, which can serve patients from low-income families and rural areas who do not have regular access to rehabilitation facilities. The developed soft robots and trilateral learning algorithms can be applied to manufacturing, logistics, and space exploration to reduce work-related injuries and improve work  performance.  The  impacts  of  this  project  will  be  broadened  by  multiple  integrated  educational activities,  including  offering  summer  workshops  and  internships  to  students  from  minority-serving institutions to increase the awareness of medical robotics, co-design of a new cross-disciplinary course on robotic rehabilitation to both engineering and medical students, and dissemination of training materials to wider patient population by partnering with centers of independent living.

FP00031873,699,,,,,1,,,"The 311 systems that city officials currently deploy can efficiently detect non-emergency civic issues such as potholes and trash. From a socio-technical perspective, residents can re-appropriate the technology for their own purpose adding new capacities and affordances not initially intended. For example, when Hurricane Irma hit Miami in 2017, residents used 311 systems to report disaster-related issues, which led city officials to adapt the system by creating a new category [2]. This user-driven technology re-appropriation has been called the emancipation process [3]. Although 311 systems have not been designed to facilitate disaster- or pandemic-related communication, individuals use them as critical methods to report issues to the local governments. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of civic infrastructures that range from reduced public transportation systems and the closure of public libraries. These changing norms and the emergence of new issues create a challenge and an opportunity for local governments and publics. If managed well, they can co-produce effective civic technology that addresses pandemic-related issues, systematizes the management of quality services, and can include this effort in local governments performance metrics. The success of civic technology for both citizens and local governments lies in understanding the tension between managerial efficiency and citizen empowerment. At its core, we aim to understand how people use the system, how local governments support peoples different uses of the system, and how the different performance metrics of local governments for 311 systems function at the metropolitan area level. We have established connections with DMVs jurisdictions during our Stage 1 period through roundtables and discussion sessions. Also, we consolidated available 311 datasets as a unified database from four DMV jurisdictions. Based on these resources and connections, we will (1) survey and consolidate local governments performance metrics that assess the outcomes of 311 systems in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area (a.k.a., DMV area), (2) analyze their 311 datasets using AI technologies and statistical methods to understand the changes in peoples 311 use patterns in the six jurisdictions in the DMV area during the pandemic, (3) survey city officials to examine how each government has engaged the changing needs of their residents, and (4) build a web-based visualization tool as a playbook that demonstrates jurisdictions assessment metrics regarding 311 systems and their best practices.Intellectual Merit: Through surveying the six governments assessment metrics for their 311 systems and analyzing their 311 datasets, we will (1) understand the co-evolution process of civic technology during the pandemic (i.e., emancipation process) and theorize the socio-technical system of civic technology and residents through a community resilience lens, (2) contribute to computational methods and AI technologies that identify sub-communities of 311 users by combining diverse datasets and 311 data from the DMV area, and (3) improve visualization techniques for demonstrating the policy landscape of 311 systems that are embedded in and shape the civic service processes.Broader Impacts: This project provides an overarching assessment framework embedded in a visualization tool for different local governments in the DMV area. These tools and metrics will be able to directly impact governments service quality, system design adjustment processes, their understanding of pandemic-related issues, and citizens awareness of communication processes. Surveys and the participatory tool assessment processes will engage city officials, civic organizations, and residents in a way that increases their understanding of the regional ecologies of civic technology, policies, and their impact. This research will also educate undergraduate and graduate students about data science, socio-technical systems, and their social implications, particularly regarding marginalized communities who are less represented in the 311 systems and in the emancipation process.",
FP00031876,700,,,,,1,,,"SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on student learning outcomes as well as their social and emotional health. Disruptions to in-person learning have contributed to a 31% reduction in reading ability and an additional 32-37% in learning loss across all subject areas for the 2020-2021  academic  year.  Learning  loss  may  be  even  greater  in  economically  disadvantaged communities where children and families had less access to resources, such as internet or child care, to facilitate online learning. During the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of psychological distress have been exacerbated (Hafstad & Augusti, 2021). School closures and shifts to remote learning contributed to increased stress and anxiety (Gruber et al., 2021) and constrained the ability of children to socialize with peers and receive mental health services (Poletti & Raballo, 2020), as exemplified by increases in emergency department visits related to mental-health among youth during  this  time  (Leeb  et  al.,  2020).  The  increase  in  depression  symptoms  and  worsening  of emotional well-being among children (Patrick et al., 2020; Thorisdottir et al., 2021) have prompted calls  for  interventions  to  promote  positive  mental  health  to  mitigate  negative  effects  of  the pandemic (Golberstein et al., 2020). Our proposed project addresses this and meets the ADE priority area focused on supporting the mental, behavioral, and physical health of students by  providing  evidence-based  after-school  enrichment  programming  to  support  social, emotional, and physical health of students through active and inclusive play. Time spent on the playground during recess and before/after school are often the most talked about and enjoyable parts of the school day for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics recognizes recess as an essential part of the school day as it impacts childrens cognitive, social, emotional and physical health and development. As the pandemic has contributed to declines in childrens physical (Lpez-Gil et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2020) and mental health (Patrick et al., 2020), prioritizing recess and before/after school play is a critical opportunity to support childrens health and well-being, contributing to capacity for learning and academic success. The combined physical, social, and emotional health benefits of play cannot be overlooked in our efforts  to  mitigate the  effects  of  COVID-19.  Both  after-school  time  and  recess  are  accessible settings that reach nearly all children in the State. Our proposed project will provide evidence-based curriculum to enrich existing after-school programming through active and inclusive play and expand to recess to support social, emotional, and physical health of children meeting the ADE priority area focused on supporting the mental, behavioral, and physical health of students through after-school enrichment. This project uses the evidence-based Play On! program to promote social, emotional, and physical health of children through active and inclusive play. The Play On! program will be implemented during the after-school enrichment programs at 14 elementary schools in the Mesa  Unified  School  District  using  a  tiered  approach  that  begins  with  a  playground  design assessment  and  a  training  for  after-school  coordinators,  and  extends  to  include  trainings  for students to become peer leaders to facilitate active and inclusive play during recess. This train the trainer model allows for great reach as the students attending the 14 after-school programs will spread their knowledge and skills to all students attending the schools during recess. The Mesa Unified School District is the largest school district in the state of Arizona, serving more than 60,000 students at 52 elementary schools. The district serves many vulnerable students as 20%  of families  live  below  the  federal  poverty  level  and  only  26%  of  parents/guardians  have earned a bachelors degree or higher. This District serves a diverse student population including 50.5% white, 38.2% Hispanic, 4.6% African American, 4.3% Native American and 2.4% Asian. This intervention initially targets children who attend the after-school Xplore program which is offered at 14 elementary schools in Mesa.   ",
FP00031906,701,,,,,1,,,"Along with the century-long advancement of data analysis across a tremendous variety of scientific fields, including social science, behavioral science, economics, astronomy, bioinformatics, linguistic, and many others, the regression model is the most powerful and the most widely used tool to reveal scientific laws. For the regression model, three fundamental statistical assumptions serve as the cornerstones yet have been often adopted incautiously: (i) the exogeneity such that the covariates are not dependent on the random noises; (ii) the random noises are identically and independently distributed; and (iii) the population of random noises admits normality or similar distributional assumptions. Though statistical tests developed specifically for one of the three assumptions scattered in the literature, a unified powerful validation procedure on all three assumptions remains a long-lasting missing component in statistics and related data-driven research. Ignorance on the violation of these assumptions results in spurious discoveries, compromise of sensitivity, and poor predictions. Bringing together a strong team from statistics and public health, we propose to fill this knowledge gap to investigate all these fundamental assumptions using a unified framework of BET (Binary Expansion Testing) newly developed by Dr. Zhang under recent NSF DMS-1916237. The proposed computationally efficient BET framework has the advantage of being non-parametric, universal in terms of interpreting different statistical problems via a common formulation. Our preliminary investigations have shown that the powerfulness of BET framework makes it possible to detect linear association, monotonic association, circular dependence, locally clustering structure, and many others, while existing tests are always suboptimal against certain aforementioned alternatives. Additionally, the BET framework can provide a clear interpretation on the structure of dependence, which has been long missing in the literature, to guide the practitioners to better understand the fundamental science laws generating such data. Taking the advantage of BET framework and concept of the copula, we formulate the validation of both assumptions on i.i.d. noises and their population normality as testing certain uniformity and formulate the detection of exogeneity as testing the independence via a multivariate normal mean problem. The proposed framework is entirely novel to validate the century-long fundamental statistical assumptions for data analysis in almost all fields nowadays, and it will provide a solid ground for general research yet reveal more scientific discoveries with potentially high impacts.",

FP00032018,708,,,,,1,,,"Music is a stimulus capable of evoking a broad range of emotions and feelings from joy and peacefulness to sadness and fear and thus has been proposed to be an effective tool for emotion regulation and stress management. However, prior research relies primarily on music listening in controlled environments and laboratory experiments. There is a lack of evidence that music-listening can influence emotion regulation, and ultimately reduce acute stress, in real-world settings and uncontrolled environments. We aim to develop the first adaptive just-in-time music-based intervention to regulate emotions and reduce stress in the real-world. We develop and test the intervention focusing on alcohol use disorders as our pilot application. Alcohol use in the Unites States is a public health crisis as the prevalence of alcohol use disorders and the diseases associated with alcohol use disorders are increasing at alarming rates among all sociodemographic groups. At the same time, among adults who seek treatment, a significant number return to alcohol use following a period of abstinence. Key factors contributing to relapse are cravings and stress. Intervention strategies that can target negative affect associated with stress appear key. We propose the study to address three aims: For Aim 1, we will conduct formative research with a sample of young adults who have received treatment for alcohol use disorders and are within 90 days of sobriety to identify features of music selections that are most effective in reducing stress in real-world, ambulatory settings; For Aim 2, we will focus on developing mobile health technology that uses passive sensing and machine learning to automatically predict moments of heightened stress in real-time and suggest specific musical selections when stress is detected. During Aim 3, we will test the feasibility of a novel music-listening intervention among a second sample of young adults who have received treatment for AUD and are within 90 days of sobriety. The goal of our proposed study is to provide a cost-effective and accessible music-based intervention to support the increasing population of individuals struggling with relapse risk during early stages of recovery from alcohol dependency. This research will provide a critical foundation upon which large-scale efficacy trials of adaptive just-in-time music interventions can be conducted.",

FP00032099,710,,,,,1,,,"Medicaid data from 08-12 suggests middle-age and older adults (MA+) with ASD are more likely to be diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers disease (Alz) compared to controls. Our preliminary data show accelerated longitudinal decline of memory and hippocampal volume in MA+ ASD, compared to matched controls. Similar to MA+ ASD, adults with the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP+) also show accelerated long-term memory decline and have smaller hippocampi, compared to BAP- controls. Individuals with ASD are more likely to carry the Alz risk gene, apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele, and the e4 allele moderates hippocampal volume reduction to a larger degree in MA+ ASD than controls. Our long-term goal is to have a sustained impact on knowledge and clinical care of both Alz and ASD by elucidating their multi-level interaction from genetic to phenotypic to population comorbidity. The specific aims are to: 1) evaluate polygenic risk score (PRS) enrichment for Alz and ASD in the other condition, 2) determine Alz PRS effects on accelerated MA+ ASD and BAP+ aging, and 3) extend older Medicaid findings on Alz risk in ASD with current Medicaid data. Our study design will use a combination of publicly-available genomic data, our ongoing longitudinal cohort of MA+ ASD and controls who receive cognitive and MRI batteries every two-years (n=121), a closed longitudinal cognitive aging cohort with BAP characterization (n=307), and Medicaid claims data. PRS summary statistics from large GWAS will be applied to whole genome ASD vs. control data from our own ASD cohort (n=222) and Autism Sequencing Consortium (n=9,975); Alz vs. control data will be from Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project (n=16,906).We will use longitudinal mixed effects models to detect a diagnosis group (ASD vs. NT or BAP+ vs. BAP-) by Alz PRS interaction on dependent variables (e.g. short-term memory, long-term memory, and hippocampal metrics). Multivariate logit models will identify the association of Alz in beneficiaries with or without an ASD diagnosis to estimate predictive margins for relative risk. Our expected outcomes are to determine if genetic risk for Alz and ASD is elevated in the other clinical condition. Further, we will determine if Alz risk genes contribute to accelerated cognitive and brain aging in MA+ ASD and adults with BAP traits. Finally, we will provide the most current risk estimates of Alz in MA+ with ASD. This is relevant to public health because findings will advance fundamental knowledge of the genetic, cognitive, and neural interplay between Alz and ASD, which will accelerate scientific discovery in each condition and their overlap. This will lay the groundwork for precision medicine advances for the intersection of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.",
FP00032104,711,,,,,1,,,"COVID-19 vaccines, currently available to children over age 5, are a powerful method of preventing new infections and reducing the risk of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. However, vaccination rates among children aged 5-17 remain suboptimal. These rates reflect, in part, parental and legal guardian hesitancy to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. The evidence is clear that storytelling interventions can be used as an effective health promotion strategy by providing scientific information while promoting emotional engagement and identification with the stories and characters. While national health communication experts have suggested using storytelling as an effective intervention strategy to promote vaccination, we will take the innovative next steps to create and evaluate a digital storytelling (DST) intervention to reduce parental vaccine hesitancy. This community-engaged public health research examines the feasibility and acceptability of using digital stories of formerly COVID-19 vaccine-hesitant parents to reduce other parents and legal guardians vaccine hesitancy. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior, we propose to (Aim 1) develop digital stories (each 2-3 minutes long) with a diverse sample of parents and legal guardians who transformed from being COVID-19 vaccine-hesitant to vaccine-accepting. In Aim 2, we will assess feasibility and acceptability of a web-based pilot DST intervention vs. information-only control among parents and legal guardians (n=80) of children who are not vaccinated against COVID-19. We will also explore patterns of pre- to post-intervention changes in vaccine perceptions, vaccine hesitancy, intentions to vaccinate children against COVID-19, and childrens vaccine uptake at 3-month post-intervention. If our study demonstrates feasibility, acceptability, and promising reductions in vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccine uptake, we will conduct a full-scale RCT to examine the effectiveness of the DST intervention to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in our target population. Results of this more extensive study could be used in future DST campaigns to increase childhood and adolescent immunizations (e.g., flu, HPV). In addition, our innovative research may provide evidence of scalable, disseminatable strategies to reduce vaccine hesitancy and can be used for other rapid vaccination efforts for potential future outbreaks.",

FP00032117,713,,,,,1,,,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth reduces quality and years of life. Disparities in T2D emerge early in life and disproportionately impact low-income and minority youth. T2D is the result of complex processes involving biological susceptibility and interdependent social, behavioral, and environmental factors that represent the root causes of disparities. Obesity, insulin resistance and pancreatic -cell dysfunction have been the focus of many clinical studies aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of T2D in youth. However, multiple factors directly and indirectly contribute to risk including unhealthy behaviors, puberty, genetic predisposition, and epigenetic modulation. These additional factors are influenced by the social and environmental context that must but considered to advance our understanding of T2D in high-risk populations. Our transdisciplinary team has extensive experience understanding, preventing, and managing T2D among vulnerable and underrepresented youth. For over a decade, our research has been guided by a Community Advisory Board that has informed multiple NIH-funded studies focused on T2D in vulnerable populations. Our overall approach to T2D research is framed within an Expanded Ecodevelopmental Model that considers cultural, environmental, and social contexts that influence individual health behaviors and health outcomes during critical life periods. We will apply this model and leverage high-volume pediatric endocrine practice situated within one of the nations largest integrated pediatric healthcare systems to recruit a diverse sample of youth with obesity and prediabetes. To further support this work, we have developed a robust community engagement strategy to ensure that the research extends the available science AND advances towards health equity in the local community. Our transdisciplinary team is well-suited to contribute to a national consortium that identifies high-risk youth, understands the pathophysiology of T2D, and ultimately improves the health of this population. With this context, we propose the following Specific Aims:Specific Aim 1: Enroll, phenotype, and prospectively follow an ethnically diverse cohort of 6000 (400/site) children ages 8-14 with obesity and prediabetes. Specific Aim 2: Integrate free living assessments of glycemia and health behaviors. Specific Aim 3: Document family, social and environmental conditions that contribute to T2D risk. Specific Aim 4: Collect and bank fasting blood samples to support genomic and metabolomic analyses using validation and discovery approaches. Specific Aim 5: Examine the individual and potential interactive effects of biological, behavioral, and social determinants of T2D risk.",
FP00032132,714,,,,,1,,,"The long-term objective of this research program is to develop safe and effective anti-aging therapeutics that delay or reverse the cellular aging process in aged adults by enhancing the function of the immortality enzyme telomerase, specifically in adult stem cells. Telomerase is a highly specialized enzyme that adds telomere DNA repeats onto chromosome ends to maintain genomic stability. Telomerase expression is highly regulated, active only in germline and stem cells, but silenced in the normal somatic cells upon differentiation from stem cells. Reactivating telomerase in somatic cells is a critical step in tumorigenesis and therefore undesired. To develop a safe anti-aging therapeutic strategy to prevent telomere shortening in aging cells, we aim to identify natural or synthetic compounds that enhance telomerase function in only adult stem cells where telomerase is already actively expressed, without activating telomerase expression in normal somatic cells.For the R21 Phase in years 1-2, we will perform high-throughput screening of natural product and small molecule libraries to identify natural extracts or small molecules that enhance telomerase repeat addition processivity, i.e., adding more telomeric DNA repeats to a given DNA primer per enzyme catalytic cycle. In Aim 1, a primary screening will be performed using our newly developed telomerase activity assay in 384-well plate format. We aim to achieve the first milestone by identifying 10-100 positive hits from our primary screening of 100,000 extracts/compounds. The initial hit compounds will undergo a secondary screening using the conventional telomerase activity primer-extension assay that directly monitors nucleotide incorporation by telomerase in vitro without any PCR amplification steps. In Aim 2, we aim to achieve the second milestone by creating telomerase-deficient human fibroblast cell lines that have one copy of the telomerase catalytic protein gene deleted and exhibit telomere shortening over passages as an in vivo cellular model system which will be used in the R33 Phase to validate the effect of hit compounds on the cultured human cells.For the R33 Phase in years 3-5, we will evaluate the toxicity and in vivo effects of the identified telomerase enhancers on telomerase-deficient human cells and aged animals. In Aim 3, any hit compounds that are not toxic to the cultured cells will be subjected to additional cell-based validation to test their effects on promoting telomere lengthening in human fibroblasts that are telomerase-deficient and exhibit a fast telomere shortening rate. We will also develop a telomerase-deficient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for another cell-based screening. We aim to achieve the third milestone by identifying lead compounds that show low cell toxicity and increase telomere length in the TERT-deficient iPSCs. Lastly, we will test the promising lead compounds in aged marmoset monkey animals for effects on telomere lengthening in leukocytes. Such effective telomerase enhancers would provide a promising means for developing anti-aging therapeutics.",

Yet, despite the established health benefits of participating in WIC, participants miss scheduled appointments and leave benefits unredeemed. Participation rates have dropped significantly among Inter Tribal Council of Arizona (ITCA) WIC-eligible families over the last year despite rising rates of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate strategies that are effective in increasing participant engagement for the unique population served by the ITCA WIC. Text messaging is a demonstrated effective strategy to engage with WIC-eligible families. To address issues of non-engagement (missed appointments) and non-redemption of benefits, we will develop and evaluate a catalog of text messages based on best practices in nutrition and health communication that can be sent to WIC participants served by the ITCA. Messages will focus on both (1) reminding participants about appointments, and (2) reminding participants to redeem their benefit packages. Text messages will be developed in consultation with ITCA WIC staff as well as a nutrition and health communication consultant. Developed messages will be tailored based on beneficiary category (pregnant women, infants, children, multiple beneficiary) and location (rural, urban, tribal communities). We anticipate developing about 30 tailored text messages; these messages will be field-tested before the ITCA staff implement them. After ITCA implements the new text messages over a 4-5 month period, we will evaluate their effectiveness by determining their impact on missed appointments and benefits redemption among different beneficiary categories. Findings will be shared in the form of a report with the ITCA by March 2023. We will also provide an organized compendium of text messages created for internal use by ITCA WIC.Dr. Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, a professor of nutrition with extensive experience in nutrition policy, grant management, evaluation design and management of community partnerships, will serve as the principal investigator on the project.

FP00032203_Res1,719,,,,,1,,,"People with Parkinsons disease (PD) experience restricted communicative participation [1,2], which means that they have difficulty taking part in life situations where knowledge, information, ideas or feelings are exchanged [3]. This restricted participation can have significant consequences for ones well-being, including social isolation, loss of employment, loss of relationships, and difficulty accessing services [3,4]. We currently do not have behavioral treatment targets that directly and effectively improve participation. The most basic form of communicative participation is an interaction between two people, a dyad, engaged in dialogue. The small body of research that has examined interaction behaviors (i.e., interdependent verbal behaviors) in people with PD (and/or dysarthria) has used descriptive or case study designs to qualitatively describe the dialogues [5-11]. In a prior R21, we extended this work, leveraging the existing rich literature on dialogue theory that was developed with neurotypical (NT) adults, coupled with speech signal processing techniques and advanced statistical modeling, to quantify interaction behaviors in task-controlled dialogue corpora [12-16]. Reasonable conclusions from this collection of studies are that the interaction behaviors of PD-NT dyads are fundamentally different from those of NT-NT dyads; and that these differences correlate to restricted participation in the dialogues of people with PD. The next step is to move from these simple correlations to deriving causal, mechanistic relationships between interaction behaviors and participation outcomes, allowing us to identify candidate treatment targets for improving participation in people with PD. We will use two aims to do this. The first aim, using a between-within design, will compare interaction behavior from the dialogues of PD-NT and NT-NT dyads and quantify their variation across typical communicative situations. We will audio-record people with PD and NT controls (dyad condition) engaged in a problem-solving and a rapport-building dialogue (goal condition) with a familiar and an unfamiliar partner (partner condition). The resulting 480 dialogues will be annotated, and automated metrics of interaction behaviors, including individual interaction behaviors of each person (articulatory precision, rhythmic predictability, language complexity) and coordinative interaction behaviors (entrainment, conversational repair, turn-taking), will be extracted. Linear mixed effects models will be used to assess these behaviors by dyad, goal, and partner condition. Our second aim looks to assess the impact of each interaction behavior on communicative participation outcomes in the dialogues of people with PD within a causal inference framework. Whereas SA1 compares the interaction behaviors across dyad types and communicative situations, SA2 uses the interaction behaviors as input to a causal inference model. This will allow us to quantify how much each interaction behavior contributed to the associated participation outcome for that dialogue and simulate the effects of intervening on interaction behavior. Assessment of the impact of each interaction behavior will be done using Bayesian multilevel modeling. Results will inform a subsequent hypothesis-driven clinical trial of interaction targets.",
FP00032210,720,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARYThe long-term goal of this line of research is to improve physical therapy for fall prevention in people with Parkinsons disease (PD). Falls place an enormous burden on people with PD, leading to injury, isolation, and often, death. Physical therapy can improve balance; however, its effect on falls is often limited. A barrier to developing effective rehabilitative approaches is our lack of knowledge regarding which specific aspects of balance should be targeted to reduce falls in this group. For example, therapists are aware that reactive stepping (i.e., the quick steps to regain balance after a loss of balance) are related to falls. However, there is limited evidence directly relating poor reactive stepping responses to falls in people with PD, and no evidence regarding which aspects of stepping (e.g., size, speed, latency?) should be targeted during therapy to have the greatest impact on falls. Similarly, while there is some evidence that standing balance (i.e., sway) relates to falls, the specific aspects of sway (area, relation to base of support?) that are most related to falls in people with PD are poorly understood. These gaps impede clinicians ability to reduce falls in people with PD. This project will identify the specific aspects of reactive balance and standing sway that are related to prospectively measured falls. This information is a critical first step in designing effective clinical trials to test rehabilitation approaches for fall reduction. Further, these data provide preliminary information assist clinicians with the development of thera-peutic plans to treat falls. This focus on improving rehabilitative approaches will improve our knowledge of fall-related balance outcomes in people with PD, and will also provide insight into other older adults at risk for falls.The stated goals of this project will be achieved by assessing reactive balance and standing sway in 100 people with PD at risk for falls, as well as following these individuals for 12 months to prospectively track falls. Aim 1 will assess the relationship between prospectively assessed falls and specific reactive balance outcomes. Stepping outcomes will be collected under dual-task conditions, given that falls often occur when attention is divided. Preliminary data indicate that certain aspects of stepping, such as reactive step length, may be particularly related to falls. Aim 2 will assess, in the same participants noted above, the relationship between falls and novel standing sway outcomes, also under dual-task conditions. These domains were chosen due to their importance for falls in people with PD, as well as preliminary data linking several of these measures of balance to falls in those with PD. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess the relative importance of reactive and standing balance outcomes for fall prediction in one model.This work is a critical first step in addressing an important clinical question: Which aspects of balance should clinicians target for fall-prevention therapy in people with PD? Specifically, data will guide subsequent research assessing rehabilitation approaches to reduce falls in those with PD, and will provide immediate, albeit preliminary, information to clinicians regarding rehabilitative clinical targets.",

FP00032223,722,,,,,1,,,"Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes (CMs) lost their cell cycle and regeneration capacity. Loss of myocardium due to injuries, such as acute myocardial infarction, often results in fibrotic scar and the depressed cardiac function. Despite the success of interventional coronary procedures to restore blood perfusion, morbidity and mortality from acute myocardial infarction are still significant. Developing cardioprotective strategies to reduce infarct size is important for treating ischemic heart disease. In patients with heart failure, acute apelin administration increases cardiac output. Despite these encouraging results, several critical issues were identified that are associated with the off-target effects of apelin. First, apelin has very short half-life, and observed cardiac functional benefits are rather transient, i.e., lasts for 30-40 minutes after apelin infusion. Second, a significant side effects associated with systemic administration of apelin is the lower blood pressure due to the dilation of peripheral vessels. Third, it has been reported that apelin infusion is associated with increased risk of tumorigenesis. The project aimed to address these critical issues. We plan to conjugate a short CM targeting peptide to the surface of apelin-loaded nanoparticles (CTP-NPAPELIN). The peptide will target NPs to specifically to the CMs. And the apelin-loaded NPs release apelin slowly which maintains drug concentration in the heart. We hypothesize that these CM targeting NPs enhance apelin mediated cardioprotection in injured animal hearts and reduce the off-target effects of apelin by specifically delivering the drug to CMs. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 is to study if CTP-NPAPELIN increase the binding affinity and specificity of NPs to CMs. We incorporated peptide (GVTVRALRGTGSWGGC) to the surface of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs. In this specific aim, we will optimize NPs formulas and characterize solubility, stability, and physicochemical properties of apelin and NPs. Specific Aim 2 is to study if conjugation with CTP enhances NPAPELIN mediated cardioprotection in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, and reduces their off-target effects. In this specific aim, we will determine if intravenous injection of CM-targeted NPAPELIN (CTP-NPAPELIN) results in CM specific uptake of apelin, and whether this treatment confers cardioprotection in the mice with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion similar to the animals receiving intramyocardial injection of NPAPELIN. We will also assess if CM-targeted NPAPELIN will show less off-target effects (i.e., hypotension and tumorigenesis) compared to non-targeted NPAPELIN during 6-month follow up.

An important shortcoming that has been identified is thatthere is a need to encode known physical laws to effectively leverage prior knowledge, to better inform deeplearning. In computer vision literature, much prior knowledge exists about how lighting interacts with sur-face geometry and reflectance properties, the workings of projective geometry, and how temporal dynamicscan be used to explain observed dynamic scenes. These physical constraints manifest themselves in theimage space by constraint the set of feasbile or valid outputs. Even though images are observed and storedas high-dimensional Euclidean arrays, they are often very structured in how they depict objects of interest(OOIs), either natural or artificial. Camera images are constrained to lie in low-dimensional subsets (of largeEuclidean spaces) termed image manifolds. The dimensions of these manifolds correspond to the physicaldegrees of freedom in the observed scenes, which are usually quite small.There have been numerous efforts and research directions seeking to characterize these image mani-folds, both empirically and theoretically, throughout the last two decades. The sparsity of training imagesprevents the learning of the image manifold beyond the observed regions. We will combine the strengthsof deep neural nets (DNNs) and the geometric structure of image manifolds to overcome these past limi-tations. If fully exploited, these ideas can easily help develop stronger models without reliance on largerdatasets alone. In this project, we will develop generative architectures which bake-in variables motivatedby imaging-physics, naturally expressed as group-theoretic control variables (see Fig. 1). This would allowus to train models that can generate the space of all possible images of an object under all viewing conditionsand illumination variations. We will then develop transfer algorithms that can adapt these geometry-awaregenerative models to new objects with small observed training sets. End-tasks such as object recognitionwill then be enabled by measuring the distance between corresponding object manifolds, instead of the con-temporary approach of measuring divergence in features. Based on our prior work, we will bring to beartools from Riemannian geometry, group theory, and statistical machine learning to encode knowledge ofthe physics of image formation, in a form that can be fused efficiently with contemporary deep-learningarchitectures.Novelty and Uniqueness: The key novelty proposed is in learning, exploiting, and evaluating the geome-tries of image manifolds associated with objects of interest in DNNs for improving performance in visiontasks. We will modify learning architectures, along with techniques for transfer learning and domain adap-tation, to learn image manifolds of interest. We will impose non-Euclidean geometric constraints over latentspaces in generative models, which are inspired by the physics of image formation. Specifically, we willimpose geometries over latent-spaces such as a) Grassmannian to account for illumination subspace models,Figure 1: Our approach lies in developing minimal Bayes error rate classification models, using manifold-to-manifold distancemeasures, leveraging group theoretic control variables for image-manifold characterization.1Adapt learnt manifold to new object class from small training setControl variables expressed as a product space over groups and matrix manifoldsImage manifold with group-theoretic control for given object under controlled conditionsManifold-to-manifold distance for lowest Bayes error rateGenerative networks, GANs, VAEs, transformersb) group structures, such as SO(3), to account for pose variations, c) low-dimensional shape deformationmodels learnt using elastic shape analysis, and d) models of temporal variation via dynamical-analysis, toparametrize unknown image manifolds. Another novel aspect of this project will be to quantify, both theo-retically and empirically, gains in classification and labeling tasks when DNNs are trained using geometriesof image manifolds. We will merge the past asymptotic theory developed for automatic target recognition(ATR) with computational power of DNNs to characterize performance gains. In addition, we will showthat the proposed approach can provide explainable models and can be useful in learning models from lessdata.This project brings together a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise in computer vi-sion (Chellappa, Turaga, Patel), machine learning (Chellappa, Turaga, Dasarathy, Srivastava, Berisha), andstatistics (Dasarathy, Srivastava, Berisha), to develop high-dimensional geometric techniques and tools forunderstanding the behavior of DNNs applied to images. The PIs have extensive and unique experience indeveloping efficient statistics models over nonlinear Riemannian manifolds such as shape manifolds, graphmanifolds, Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces [] in computer vision and pattern recognition. Fur-thermore, many team members have a history of tight-knit previous collaborations, including many jointpublications.2 Goals and ImpactThis project consists of the following specific goals and impacts: Image manifold generative models. Leverage deep generative models such as GANs, variationalautoencoders (VAEs) and transformers to synthesize novel images with specific views by imposingnon-Euclidean geometric constraints over latent spaces in generative models. The generated data willallow us to extrapolate beyond the observed region of the image manifold. Theoretical and empirical analysis of geometric DNNs. Quantify object recognition and ATR per-formances based on new theoretic results in conjunction with GAN-based characterization of imagemanifolds. This will allow us to quantify the error rates when the image manifolds are not knownexplicitly and implicitly. Transferring data-geometry in deep neural nets. Develop hybrid networks for shifting learnt rep-resentations to new objects/targets and new scenes. This will allow us to transfer the knowledge ofimage manifold from one object/target to another. Efficient metrics for manifold-to-manifold divergence. Develop tools to compute divergence be-tween image manifolds that bound the Bayes error. This will allow us to efficiently compute diver-gence between image manifolds. Applications in Trainable AI and Explainable AI. The proposed approach is capable of providingmore explainable models and can be useful in learning deep networks from less data.3 Technical PlanImage manifolds are the subsets of the image space that contain intrinsic variability associated with ap-pearances of objects imaged under different conditions [13, 14]. To make things precise, let I  denote a3D object, with the label , and let  denote the group of variables encoding the imaging conditions. Forinstance,  can be the group of all possible rotations (pose) of I  relative to the camera. More generally, is a product group of physical attributes of the scene: illumination variables, shape deformations, surfacetextures, and other contextual variables representing the imaging conditions. The group  acts on the I in a predefined way. The orbit of I  under  is given by: [I ] = {I |  }, the set of all possibleconfigurations of I . See [1] for details. Let T denote a 2D projection on a grid that models the imaging2process, with T (I ) denoting the image of the object I  under the imaging conditions represented by .Then, the set of all possible images of I , specified as:(1)is said to be the image manifold of I . The full image manifold is then the union (not necessarily disjoint)of such manifolds associated with different OOIs. That is, I = I . Figure 1 shows an illustration of themanifold of facial images under different illumination, pose, and dynamical variability.I  = {T (I )|  } .This characterization helps define a more effective notion of noise or clutter in image data: a deviationthat moves points on one image manifold to another is more difficult to handle than the deviation thatsimply moves points away from all manifolds. If the image manifolds associated with OOIs are known,either explicitly or implicitly, one can exploit their geometries in designing optimal learning and inferencealgorithms for computer vision.Since image manifolds represent the holy grail in designing optimal architectures for vision tasks, it isnatural to seek their specifications. Given some image data, viewed as sample points on an image manifoldI  the goal is to derive expressions or algorithms for reaching other points on I , denoting novel viewsof the same object. Earlier efforts utilized interpolation techniques, especially kernel methods, to fill inthe missing parts of I . These efforts were focused on seeking-dimensional representations of images byflattening or unrolling image manifolds. However, these efforts came up short when faced with sparsedata points. This motivates a critical need to extrapolate beyond the observed regions of I . Notably thegeneration of images of OOIs from novel perspectives has been a long-standing problem in the field. Severalimportant ideas, including dictionary-based representations and Bayesian approaches with structured priorshave been applied to this problem with varying degrees of successes.The advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has caused a paradigm shift in approaches to vision andpattern recognition, in both generative and discriminatory problems. DNNs and related data-driven frame-works have been very successful in learning complex nonlinear maps between inputs (images, videos, etc.)and outputs (labels, classifications, and even images). These DNNs, when trained with high-quality anno-tated data, provide remarkable performances in applying learnt mappings on the test data. This proposalseeks to boost DNN learning and performance by incorporating the geometries of the image manifolds intraining process.Research questions.(1) How can we utilize the learnt geometries of image manifolds to generate train-ing data for DNNs? (2) Can we use a combination of the (image manifold) geometry and the power ofGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to explore unseen regions of the image manifolds? (3) Can weuse the Lie group structure of  to help traverse the image manifold? For example, the notion of paralleltransport for transforming deformations. (4) Theoretically, why do we expect improvements in the perfor-mance when DNNs are trained with samples from image manifolds, rather than the vast noise space aroundthem? (5) How can we quantify the gains in DNN performance as a function of our ability to learn imagemanifolds? (6) Can this setup  training DNNs help achieve fundamental bounds on classification errors?These questions lead us into the following specific research tasks.Phase 1.Task 1: Image manifold generative models. We will undertake systematic revisiting of generativemodels across controllable priors, physics-based generators and discriminators, to enable generation of theimage-manifolds under orbits of group actions. Specifically, we will develop the following approaches.Task 1.1: Geometric priors. Design of input distributions for object generation using group-theoreticapproaches will allow one to interact with GAN models through latent-space algebra. Algebraic control insynthesis in turn leads to semantic control. When latent-space vectors are added and subtracted to performoperations like interpolation, it leads to a common problem of distribution mismatch. For fully vectorial31case of algebraic manipulation, we seek to create a new vector given by Y =(cid:80)mixing weights drawn from a compact set such as [1, 1], with an additional constraint such as(cid:80)types of algebraic operations, the input distribution needs to be estimated in a way that brings interpolatedsamples close to the intended distribution. Consider the latent space distribution to be fX (x). Consider a fewrandom realizations from the input distribution to be given by Xi. When fully passed through a generatormodel, G(Xi) might generate a specific object in say a specific pose and lighting condition. In the commoni iXi, where i may bei i = 1.From theorems of classical probability theory, under such mixing, the resultant distribution of the output isi|i| fX (x/1) fX (x/2) . . . fX (x/n). Thus, when such a Y is passed through a generator,given bythe resulting G(Y ) can look quite distorted. Ideally, to solve distribution mismatch, we need to solve for aninput distributionarg min d(fX (x), g(x)), where g(x) =such that i  [1, 1],(2)In a recent work [24], PI Turagas group created a numerical solver for the above formulation when M =Rn. In this task, we will extend this to the case of M = SO(n)  Gnk, by exploiting the known Liealgebra and tangent-structure of SO(n) and Gnk.Task 1.2: Detail layering generators. One of the ways to develop full 3D control of generative pro-cesses in the data-driven paradigm is to develop fully differentiable 3D renderers (c.f. [?]). In practice,it is far too difficult to ensure that all the complex non-linear processes of image formation can be learnteffectively for image-synthesis when training-sets are small. Most contemporary paradigms work well forsynthesizing simple scenes containing very few objects at a time. We seek to develop a new way to thinkof image synthesis, which we term detail-layering. Detail layering is a unique structured way of synthe-sizing image data motivated by how artists employ different stages of introducing detail in art starting fromsketching, shading, object layering, and feathering to create realistic imagery.i|i| fX (x/1)  fX (x/2)  . . .  fX (x/n) where x  TX (M)x2fX (x)  .(cid:88)i = 1,(cid:90)1iIn our initial work, we have developed a two-stage network, consisting of two levels of detail layeringcategories: background and small objects. The background network generates micro- and macro-textureslike road, building, tree, sky etc, whereas the small objects network overlays foreground objects like car,person, bike etc. Additionally, we showed that the first stage generative network can take as input a sparselabel map and generates a denser object map. In preliminary work, we find that this method outperformsmany current state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark databases and metrics. Similarly in [10], wedeveloped a GAN-based approach for synthesizing face images from visual attributes where we first synthe-size the facial sketch corresponding to the visual attributes and then we generate the face image based on thesynthesized sketch. Such method was shown to produce sharper images than recent face synthesis methods.In this task, we will leverage these approaches for generating novel images for extrapolating beyond theobserved regions of I .Task 1.3: Physics-based latent space structures. Any generative model relies on a robust discrim-inator D to help the generator learn to generate realistic imagery. However, when training-sets are small,the minimax optimization problem in generative networks may never reach convergence, thus affecting thequality of the final generator network. It is thus important to help structure discriminator with latent-spaceconstraints that are physics-driven and will result in robust, fast convergence even with small datasets.In prior work, we assumed Lambertian reflectance, and convex object-shapes, under which one can showthat the image space is a convex-cone in image space [12]. A relaxation of this model leads to identifyingcones as linear-subspaces, which are seen as points on a Grassmannian manifold Gn,k (n = image-size, k= lighting dimensions, typically considered equal to number of linearly independent normals on the object4shape) [18]. Under certain conditions of variance on the Grassmannian being low, a distribution of pointson the Grassmann induces a distribution on a high-dimensional sphere (see [7]), whose dimension dependson n and k [7]. To generalize beyond Lambertian models, we will consider Lambertian + specular reflectionmodels, which will include a subspace + sparse additive model. To do this, we will need to include a sparsityinducing loss terms in our generalized version in addition to Grassmannian geodesic loss functions.Further, most objects of practical interest have non-convex object shapes. In our prior work, we as-sumed convex object shapes which in conjunction with Lambertian model leads to a subspace constraint.To generalize to non-convex objects, we will include a product of subspaces model, where each componentsubspace can model a convex sub-part of the object. We will develop efficient loss functions for this casesby including a product-space over Grassmannian constraint.Finally, to model deformation of underlying shape, we assume a non-elastic deformation of image-grid (e.g. due to shape change, expression, or photo-shop effects), which could be modeled by the frame-work of diffeomorphic maps from R2 to R2. Diffeomorphic maps are continuous, smooth, and invertiblemaps that warp an image grid. We will aim to generalize this to the case where there may regions ofnon-differentiablity due to objects going in an out of occlusion under movement. To deal with the non-differentiability part, we will adopt a smooth gradient + sparse additive model, and develop a loss functionthat includes a sparsity promoting term in the innovation.Supportive work. Given an image, potentially influenced by one or more of the above factors, we rep-resent its latent variables as a point on a product-space of hyperspheres. Between those factors, we furtherassume statistical orthogonality, as a proxy for physical independence of these fundamental variables. Prod-ucts of spheres is a generalization of tori geometry. The specification is incomplete without knowing theindividual dimensions of the hyperspheres involved. In preliminary work [23], for analytical and computa-tional tractability, we chose to set the dimensions of the spheres to be equal to each other. This, in effectimposes a simple orthonormality constraint on the latent space blocks. Even this simplified model resultedin improved disentanglement performance, even for semantically high-level factors. We believe this is be-cause even the semantic factors like these can be explained by combinations of some simple latent physicalfactors. This new model is very simple to implement (see figure 2) and enforce as a simple orthogonalityloss-function in deep-learning modules. In several experimental testbeds, we find that the proposed modelresults in improved disentanglement performance as observed in the right panel of fig 2.Figure 2: Left panel: Illustration of proposed product of Orthogonal Spheres as a latent space model. Right panel: t-SNE Plotsfor MNIST, 2D Sprites and CelebA face (Column 3) datasets with MIX auto-encoder and (top) and PrOSe +MIX (bottom). Thedifferent colors denote different attribute spaces. Reduction of within-class variance along with separation of attributes is seen inthe case of PrOSe. Reduction of variance in the presence of physical variables like lighting, pose, etc. is a testament to learnedrobustness. We will integrate these constraints into full end-to-end GAN loss functions.Task 2: Theoretical and empirical analysis of geometric DNNs.Task 2.1: Minimal Bayes error bounds. A characterization of image manifolds provides some intuitiveand fundamental results associated with learning algorithms using image data. Clearly, a perfect knowledge52D SpritesCelebAMNISTof the image manifold, combined with a suitable metric on the image space, can result in a perfect classifier.However, the question is: how does an imperfect (even a probabilistic or a generative) model of an imagemanifold perform? Also, how does the object/target recognition performance change as our knowledge ofthe image manifold changes.We will combine some prior theoretic results [13, 14], in conjunction with GAN-based characterizationof image manifolds, to quantify performances in vision tasks. The paper [14] developed an asymptotictheory for specifying error rates in misclassification when using noisy images. It was shown that the errorrates for misclassifying an object as another is:P r({estimated label = 2}|{true label = 1, i})  exp( infT (1I 1)  T (I 2)2)) .That is, the misclassification rate is dictated by the minimum distance between their image manifolds I 1and I 2. The norm here is defined by the noise distribution. For instance, if the noise is assumed to beadditive Gaussian, then    is the standard Euclidean norm. We will focus on quantifying the error rateswhen the manifolds are not known explicitly and implicitly. The search for inf  T (1I 1)  T (I 2)2will performed using GAN sampling of I 2.Task 3: Transferring data-geometry in deep neural nets.Task 3.1: Domain alignment and transfer learning. In this task, we will develop hybrid architec-tures for the problem of shifting learnt representations to new objects, and new scenes, with small trainingsets, building on insights from prior tasks. We seek to find effective approaches to model source and tar-get domains utilizing geometric approaches, in a manner that integrates with data-driven approaches. Ourapproach is a hybrid approach for alignment in terms of an analytic module and a learnable module; to bejointly solved by high-capacity network fine-tuning. We seek to leverage geometric models of source andtarget domains for the analytic part, in a manner that is motivated by the geometric structures of previousthrusts.In recent work, we developed a model to encode image manifold geometry via collections of subspaces,where we assumed an equal number of subspaces for both source and target domains. Our approach resultedin improved performance of domain adaptation, in the Office-Caltech dataset [27]. This points to fusionpossibilities with features learned from deep-nets, while leveraging geometric techniques for alignment. Wepropose to generalize our approach to a more general model for geometries, including a) variable numbersof subspaces, b) general affine subspaces, c) using a hybrid geometry + data-driven approach for domainalignment.(cid:104)(cid:105)Consider a primary task with, lets say, the goal of achieving effective class discrimination in both asource and a target domain. With inputs as source/target images directly, or latent features extracted froma pre-trained feature extractor f, we learn the parameters for a classifier network g parameterized by .In order to account for unknown geometric shifts, we formulate an auxiliary task for domain alignment.Formally, let Ly, Lc represent the cross entropy loss on the source, and conditional entropy loss on thetarget respectively, i.e.Ly (;DS) = Ex,yDSy ln g(x), Lc (;DT ) = ExDT(3)If we denote Lcb as the class balance loss, implemented as binary cross-entropy loss between the mean ofpredictions of the network over a mini-batch to that of a uniform probability vector  this loss regularizesnetwork behavior when the data exhibits large class imbalance. The overall loss function can be defined asLp = Ly + cLc + cbLcb..We propose that alternate training between an end-task like classification, and an auxiliary geometricalignment task, relaxes the requirements of the alignment step such that even simple alignment strategiescan provide sufficient information to improve the overall model. In order to develop this idea, we will beginby assuming a simplified data geometry, in the form of low-dimensional linear subspaces [27]. Note that, asg(x) ln g(x)(cid:104)(cid:105)6a generative model for a dataset, a single linear subspace or even a union of linear subspaces is a poor choiceon its own. However, we believe when coupled with an appropriate primary task using a sufficiently high-capacity deep network, a synergistic and effective domain adaptation approach can be developed. In thissubtask, we will explore various choices of data geometries, including multiple subspaces, affine subspaces,each individual data point/image as a 1D subspace (multiplicative scale invariance), and various alignmentstrategies that emerge from these choices. These will be then combined with powerful deep-learning basedfeature extractors, with the aim of achieving implicit domain alignment while keeping final classificationperformance high.Task 4: Efficient metrics for manifold-to-manifold divergence. A crucial piece in this pipeline isthe efficient computation of divergences between manifolds that bound the Bayes error. Below we describeour approach to this problem and its application to classifier architecture optimization and manifold learning.Task 4.1: Efficient estimation of divergence. There have been several attempts in the past to definedistances between general orientable manifolds inspired by the Gromov-Haussdorff distance [?, ?]. How-ever, these are typically computationally intractable. Building on past work by co-PI Dasarathy, we proposea novel and efficient algorithm for the estimation of manifold distances in our scenario. The key to our ap-proach is the observation that we have an (approximate) generator that can generate points in the manifold.Given two image manifolds I1 and I2 (which are naturally embedded in the image space), we will definetheir distance asd(I1,I2) = minII2d(I,I1) = minII1(4)where d(I,Ii) is the 2 distance (assuming a Gaussian noise model) between I and its projection onto I1.Given an image I and a manifold I1, we find the projection of I onto I1 by simply backpropagating throughthe GAN that approximately captures I1 [?]. The goal then is to find the image I  I2 that is closest toI1 in the above sense. We will model this problem as a best-arm identification problem in multi-armedbandits, where the arms are images on the manifold I2 and the rewards are a function (say negation) of thedistance of the image in question to the manifold I1. Indeed, close by points will have similar distances, andco-PI Dasarathys recent line of work [17, 26] leverages such structure to design efficient pure explorationalgorithms for multi-armed bandits.d(I,I2),The point clouds on the manfiolds generated by the GANs can be modeled as samples drawn from someunknown, but smooth 1, distribution with support on the manifold. We will leverage past work by co-PIBerisha on nonparametric, graph-based, estimators of divergences and other density functionals that boundthe Bayes error rate for two-class problems [6, 29] and multi-class problems [30].Task 4.2: Estimated bounds on the Bayes error as meta-information for classification ar-chitecture selection. Cross-validation results on held-out test data are commonly used to select an ap-propriate architecture for a classification task. That is, the algorithm designer evaluates the performanceof several classification architectures and selects the one with the lowest cross-validation error. However,this procedure provides limited information regarding absolute performance limits. Perhaps there is anotherarchitecture, one outside of the algorithm designers consideration set, that would have performed better?Herein, we will use the estimators of Bayes risk to define absolute performance targets against which tocompare the designed models. This will allow us to search for architectures that approach that estimatedBayes error bound.Task 4.3: Using the divergence measures to encourage the learning of Bayes-optimal man-ifold structures. Instead of independently training the GANs to learn the manifold of each class, wepropose to couple them during training. Traditionally, in computer vision the principal goal of a GAN is1Assumed to lie in a large nonparametric smoothness class (i.e. s-order Holder class), but otherwise unrestricted; see [25] fordetailed definition.7generation of images that have the same statistics as the training set. Instead, we propose to train the GANsjointly by augmenting the loss function to include optimization of the divergence measures that bound theBayes error. This will result in manifolds that allow the algorithm designer to trade off between matchingthe statistics of the training data, encoding the geometric priors, and maximizing the divergence betweenclasses. The starting point for the implementation will be the graph-based divergence measures from co-PIBerisha and their differentiable implementation on open-source machine learning frameworks (e.g. Py-Torch) [11]. We will use this implementation to add a regularizer that encourages the learning of manifoldstructures maximally suitable for classification. We will begin with a 2-class implementation of this problemand extend to the multi-class case using pairwise divergence estimation, per the approach in [30].Phase 2. The theory that will be developed in Phase 1 will be used to address two important problemsin AI  Trainable AI and Explainable AI. In particular, we will show how the proposed framework can beused to train networks with limited data and can provide better explanations. Object recognition and ATRexperiments will be conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.Task 5: Learning from less data. Image manifold generative models that will be developed in Task 1can be used to generate novel images of objects/targets. Once synthesized, they can be used as additionaldata to train networks. As a result, our approach can be used to train deep models with limited data. Wewill extensively evaluate the performance of different synthesis methods on the ATR and object recognitionproblems.Task 6: Explainable models by enforcing efficiently differentiable geometric constraints. Oneof the critical questions is to impose geometric losses that are also easily differentiable. In supportive work,our implementation of the regularization function used [23] orthogonal-spheres technique which we firstproposed in the context of disentangling auto-encoders. Imposing the orthogonal sphere constraint is muchsimpler than other complicated physical models [35, 31], thereby making it fairly general, flexible, andextensible. Our regularization function offers the following benefits: a) rich and diverse feature represen-tations, b) robustness to pruning or feature sub-selection, c) better semantic localization in the Grad-CAMclass activation maps, and d) reduction in model calibration error.In case of disentangled representation learning, the disentanglement objective function can be aug-R(U) = ||UU  I||2mented with the regularization term as follows(5)Here, U = [u1u2  uk] is a d  k matrix obtained by stacking together the k embeddings correspondingto k hypershperes of the latent space and ||  ||F is the matrix Frobenius norm.Given a problem minUSd,k F(U), Cayley transform computes a parametric curve on the Stiefel mani-fold to obtain a feasible iterate in the direction of iterate by a closed form solution using the gradient G andis given byF(6)where, A = GU  UG is a skew symmetric matrix and  is the step size. So, the updates for U as anelement on the Stiefel Manifold Sdk for optimizing can be optimized by the above equation. Here, G isthe network gradient. Thus, transforming the latent space representation before feeding it to generator forfurther processing.A)Ut,2Such explicit orthonormality constraint is only enforced during training time. The trained networkachieves close to orthonormal representation at evaluation time as well. Similarly, in classification setting,the standard cross entropy loss is augmented with orthonormal regularizer given by (5) on the penultimatelayer features.However, in case of mapping points onto Grassmannian manifold, the data is first mapped to the tangentspace, followed by mapping step to obtain point on the manifold. Each point in this space is an equivalenceUt1 =(cid:0)I +A(cid:1)1(I  28class of points on the Stiefel manifold that are orthogonal transforms of each other. Mathematically, wedecompose the desired function f = expp T (x), here T (x) is the neural network that transforms an inputx to a point on the tangent space, T (x) : x  Tp.As a preview of the benefits, Figure 3 (b) shows the pairwise feature similarity histogram of the baseline,auxiliary regularization methods [8,19] and th",

SignificanceObesity prevalence is increasing in the US and worldwide, and there is a critical need for developing aneffective and safe therapeutic product. The global weight loss and weight management market was valued at$165.81 billion in 2016 and is expected to reach $245.5 billion by 2022. Pathologically expanded white adiposetissue is strongly associated with increased multiple comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, andcertain types  of  cancer1.  Healthy  diets,  exercise  and  lifestyle  interventions  are  commonly  recommended forfighting obesity. But they are hard to follow and have a low efficacy in a long term. Current anti-obesity medicaltherapies include pharmacotherapy and surgery; the latter approach has high efficacy but is very invasive andexpensive. Pharmacotherapy often utilizes orally administered drugs. Most FDA-approved drugs target energyintake either by suppressing appetite or by decreasing nutrient absorption. Orally administered drugs have thehighest compliance but are beset with major problems such as a high level of hepatic metabolism (the first-passeffect) and lack of target specificity, leading to a high level of side effects and toxicity. Obesity relapse may alsooccur when drugs are stopped. More practical and better approaches to combating obesity are urgently needed.Browning  subcutaneous  (subQ)  white  adipose  tissue  (WAT)  is  potentially  a  practical  and  efficient approach for combating obesity and its comorbidities. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of WAT contains adipose stromal stem cells (ASCs), which can be differentiated into beige adipocytes after receiving appropriate cues2-4. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) expressed in brown and beige adipocytes, is a marker for these cells5, 6. UCP-1 expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown and beige adipocytes can dissipate the proton electrochemical gradient generated from oxidative phosphorylation in the form of heat5, 7. Like brown adipose tissue (BAT), beige adipose tissue not only plays a crucial role in thermogenic energy expenditure, but also act as a metabolic sink for free fatty acids, glucose, and other metabolites8. Both humans and rodents have subQ WAT. ASCs in subQ WAT are more responsive to browning agents than those in visceral WAT9. Using browning agents to induce ASC differentiation into beige adipocytes is a promising approach for obesity treatment10. Trans-resveratrol (RES) is a potent browning agent. RES is a natural polyphenolic compound found in red grape skin and many other plant species. It has less toxicity than other browning agents. Many cell culture and animal studies have demonstrated that RES has the potential to induce beige cell formation and activities by enhancing mitochondria biogenesis and UCP-1 expression via activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and further NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor  co-activator 1 (PGC1)11-16. SIRT1 can deacetylate and further activate peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), indirectly promoting browning of WAT. This modification is essential for enhancing PPAR-binding activity and recruiting PR-domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) to PPAR, which can initiate the browning of WAT17. Human studies indicate that RES can promote metabolic health, but the evidence is inconclusive regarding its browning effectiveness18, 19, most likely due to its low aqueous solubility (<0.1 mg/mL)20 and trivial bioavailability (peak plasma RES level < 10 M after high dose oral administration)21, 22, high hepatic metabolism23, and non-targeting  specificity.  However,  our  recent  study24  that  leverages  ligand-coated  nanoparticles  (NPs)  for encapsulating RES and ACS-targeted delivery convinces us that these challenging issues of RES can be solved.

ASC-targeting peptide increases RES delivery to ASCs. We incorporated a linear ASC-targeting peptide (GSWKYWFGEGGC) on the NP surface in our invention25. Using a phage display technology, it was previously found that a cyclic peptide exhibited a high binding affinity to ASCs in subQ WAT stromal cells fractions26. Due 1 to steric effects, this cyclic peptide is not ideal. We redesigned a linear ASC-targeting peptide and successfully incorporated it on the NP surface. This targeting peptide has high affinity to ASCs via binding to the cleavage product of decorin (decorin) receptor, which is highly expressed on the surface of ASCs in subQ WAT of both rodents26 and humans26, 27. Our preliminary data indicated that ASC-targeted compared to non-targeted NPs had  more  than  10-fold  higher  binding  affinity  to  human  primary  stromal  cells  isolated  from  subQ  WAT  and decorin receptor-transduced cells in vitro, and 7-fold higher subQ ASC target specificity in C57BL/6J mice. Our study28 also demonstrated that intravenous (IV) administration of ASC-targeted RES-NPs twice per week for five weeks enhanced browning of WAT via targeted delivery of RES to ASCs in the inguinal WAT (iWAT, a type of mouse subQ WAT), and subsequently resulted in 50% and 40% loss of visceral and subQ fat mass, respectively. More importantly, glucose and lipid homeostasis were obviously improved in the obese C57BL/6J mice. However, due to  the  strong first  pass  effect,  majority  of  ASC-targeted  NPs  were still  accumulated  in the  liver  after  IV injection.  Transdermal delivery of ASC-targeting peptide-RES conjugate using microneedles (MN) directly to SubQ WAT can maximize delivery and therapeutic efficacy and minimize toxicity. MN and iontophoresis are two of the most invetigated transdermal delivery approaches, promising for medication delivery through the skin to subQ WAT in a non-invasive manner29-32. MN arrays overcome problems of hypodermic needles and improve patient compliance. Of the different types of MNs, the dissolvable polymer-based are unique.  Drugs can be loaded into these MN. When they are dissolved, the loaded drugs are released into the skin, and no sharp waste would  be  remained32,  33.  Using  MN  to  deliver  drug-loaded  NPs  has  gained  much  attention34.  In  our preliminary study, we developed dissolvable MN patches and our test using pig skin confirmed their potential for transdermal delivery into SubQ WAT, especially when combined with iontophoresis. Iontophoresis utilizes an electric  current  of  0.11.0  mA/cm2,  as  an  assiting  force  for  drug/NP  permeation  across  the  dermis  and penetration deep into SubQ WAT35.  Based  on  these  exciting  recent  progresses,  we  propose  this  new  project  to:  1)  develop  techniques  for transdermal delivery of peptide-RES conjugates directly to subQ WAT, 2) study their subsequent physiological processes and measure their therapeutic efficacy, and 3) evaluate their browning efficacy and safety in guiding the subsequent human studies, as illustrated in Fig.2. We expect that the outcomes of this project will lead to a paradigm shift on combating obesity and its related diseases including type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and others, and  have  broader  impacts on public health, all of which fit to the NIH mission. The delivery techniques developed in this project may also offer other potentials.  How  exciting  it  is  to  use  ASC-targeting  peptide-RES  conjugate  for  locally  and  targeted  deliver  RES directly  to  subQ  WAT  without  blood  circulation?  A  simple  calculation  gives  us  some  clues  and  design guidance. MN height for human application is commonly around 800 m. For using on mice, a conventional pyramidal MN (100 m base and 250 m height) patch has a volume of ~ 0.083 mm3 for a 10x10 array. Assuming the  polymer  needle,  which  consists  of  peptide-RES  conjugate  and  selected  biodegradable  polymers  as  the needle backbone, has a similar density and NPs occupy a ratio of > 50% in MN, an MN patch will have an RES Peptide-RESApply MNProposed researchMN + iontophoresisApply Remove MNiontophoresis patchesBeige adipocytes burn fatFuture human application Obese unhealthy  Lean healthyMNIontophoresis++hctapnkS iSub WATExcess glucose & fat burn BrowningImproved metabolic healthAdipocyteASC SubQ WATBeige AdipocyteFig. 2. Illustration of preliminary work, proposed studies and future human application. iWAT: inguinal white adipose 2   loading of > 30 g for a 10x10 MN array. Each mouse has two iWAT, that need two 10x10 array patches carrying > 60 g RES in NPs.    Our published IV-injection study has demonstrated that for a fat mouse with a typical  iWAT mass of 0.6-0.8 g, 15 g of RES accumulated at iWAT, achieved by twice injections per week for 5 weeks, is enough to produce obvious browning effects36.  We therefore are confident on our vision on this project and the subsequent human studies:  1)  For the in vivo mice study in this project, one 10x10 MN array patch on each iWAT side has 4x required RES loading. After the MN payload tip is boosted into the dermal layer and disconnected from MN base, the tip will act as  peptide-RES reservoir, from where peptide-RES are sustained released, and then diffuse inward to iWAT where they bind to ASCs. We will also use  iontophoresis for ~ 1 minute, if necessary, to accelerate the migration of NPs to iWAT. 2)  For future human studies, much higher dose is required for the much larger size subQ WAT. Then large-size patch with a similar area dose can be used to ensure a physiological effective dose is delivered in a sustainable fashion. This browning-based anti-obesity approach would be very efficient and user friendly!  2.  Innovation  The most common approach to increase BAT or beige adipose tissue is cold acclimation37, 38, which was used as a proof of concept, but is impractical as a therapeutic measure in combating obesity38. Many therapeutic chemicals  to  induce WAT  browning  are facing formidable  challenges  such  as  non-target,  low  solubility,  low bioavailability, and high side effects and toxicity, preventing them from being used in human studies. This study proposes a new strategy of delivering targeted browning agents directly to subQ WAT without first blood circulation. As a novel strategy, it will represent a paradigm shift in combating obesity with much improved patient compliance, efficacy and safety. The innovation of this project lies at:  Unique MN-based localized transdermal delivery of peptide-RES conjugate:   The backbone of MN is biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, which further protect the peptide-RES load during storage and delivery.    Safety of the ASC-targeting peptide and RES has been validated in our animal study36.   MN-based transdermal delivery is highly patient compliant.    Peptide-RES-loaded  MN  form  small  peptide-RES  reservoir  in  the  skin,  with  sustained  release  of peptide-RES.  If necessary, DC or pulsed iontophoresis will be applied for 1-3 minutes, assisting peptide-RES diffusing deep into SubQ WAT, where peptide-RES bind to and are taken up by ASCs, and release RES into ASCs.    Unique  administration  approach  that  integrates  localized  microinjection,  controlled  prolonged  release, targeted binding and delivery, and liver/other organs bypass together:    Dramatically improve the RES delivery into ASCs and its subsequent browning efficacy and anti-obesity therapeutic function.   Much reduced administration frequency and dose, further improving the compliance.   Significantly diminished side effects and toxicity.   Burning/losing fat in desired body areas.  Enrich our knowledge on the effects of browning WAT on metabolic health using local and transdermal delivery, without off-target effects. With these paradigm shift innovations, this proposal will develop a new method for efficient drug delivery in a much compliance manner; it will expand our vision on the browning mechanism and its physiological effects on health; it will help settle the controversy on chemical-induced browning and the health consequences. Taken together, this project heralds a potential breakthrough in the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities. 3. Approach  Specific aim #1: Develop MN-based efficient transdermal delivery techniques using C57BL/6J mice and human skin as testbeds. (Wang and Fan: lead) Preliminary data  ASC-targeting  peptide  targets  ASCs  via  binding  to  the  decorin  receptor.  To  validate  ASC-targeting peptide target specificity, we incorporated the peptide on the surface of NPs to make ASC-targeted RES-NPs which were prepared by a sonication method using RES, soy PC, Kolliphor HS15 (surfactant), -tocopherol 3  acetate, and DSPE-PEG5k-peptide (5 mol% soy PC) as described in our paper36 (Fig. 3A). The non-targeted RES-NPs were made by replacing DSPE-PEG5k-peptide with DSPE-PEG5k at an equal molar amount36. Non-targeted void (V) NPs (V-NPs), or ASC-targeted V-NPs were prepared without adding RES36. We have labeled NPs with rhodamine (rhoda) dye and used them to treat decorin-transduced 3T3L1 cells at 4C (binding) and 37C (binding and uptake). Compared to non-targeted NPs, ASC-targeted NPs has more than 10-fold higher binding and uptake by the decorin-transduced 3T3L1 cells (Fig. 3B), indicating the decorin receptor-mediated binding36. ASC-targeted NPs do not bind to wild-type 3T3L1 cells, which do not have the decorin receptor36.  NPs target ASCs in mice. We measured DiD amounts in non-targeted NPs and ASC-targeted NPs and diluted them to confirm that both contained equal DiD amounts. We matched mice based on body weight (each pair of mice had similar body weight for receiving ASC-targeted or non-targeted RES-NPs), and calculated the final injection  volume  based  on  body  weight  (injection  volume  was  L/g  body  weight).  We  visualized  NPs biodistribution using an IVIS Lumina XR imaging system at different post-injection time points. At the last post-injection time point (16 hrs), mice were sacrificed, and different WAT depots, interscapular BAT (iBAT) and the liver  were  isolated.  Compared to  non-targeted  NPs,  ASC-targeted  NPs had  higher  accumulation  in  adipose tissue in situ (Fig. 3C), in isolated iWAT, retroperitoneal WAT (rWAT), gonadal WAT (gWAT) and iBAT. Among all adipose tissue depots, iWAT had the highest ASC-targeted NPs signals. ASC-targeted compared to non-targeted NPs had 3-fold higher accumulation in iWAT, and 2.5-fold lower accumulation in the liver. Even though  ASC-targeted  NPs  had  lower  accumulations  in  the  liver  than  non-targeted  NPs,  the  liver  still  had substantial NPs signals under IV injection. We also isolated SVF from iWAT, labeled them with antibodies, and identified ASCs as CD45-CD31-/CD34+CD29+, and quantified NPs signals in ASCs using flow cytometry. ASC-targeted NPs had 7-fold higher target specificity to ASCs in iWAT than non-targeted NPs.

Very recently, we are developing a dissolvable MN patch using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). Rhoda dye was loaded into each needle (Fig. 4A). As the MN were dissolved, the dye was distributed into the punched skin (Fig. 4B). After applying the MN patch on pigskin for 12 hr, the MN patch was removed. The microscope image indicates that the MN were dissolved (Fig. 4C). After using iontophoresis, the dye was driven deeply into the subQ WAT (Fig. 4D). We also incorporated DiD dye into the PLGA MN. Four groups of C57BL/6J mice received following four treatments; control (no treatment), DiD-loaded PLGA MN for 12 hours, iontophoresis for 5 minutes, and MN +  iontophoresis. Mice  (Fig. 4E) and collected organs/tissues (Fig. 4F) were imaged using the IVIS spectrum. Mice treated with MN + iontophoresis had the strongest DiD signals in situ and iWAT. As compared to iWAT, other organs/tissues had very weak DiD signals.  4 EControl IontophoresisMN MN + IontophoresisFLiver Lungs Kidneys gWATiWATACBDSubQ WATSubQ WATSubQ WAT2.5e+073.6e+073.4e+102.2e+105.8e+105.9e+10Control MNIontophoresisMN + Iontophoresis1.5e+103.2e+101.2e+102.8e+106.7e+105.0e+10Fig. 4.

Representative IVIS images of C57BL/6J mice and isolated tissues/organs (F) after transdermal delivery of DiD dye using different MN, iontophoresis or both.   Methods (i)    Transdermal  MN  development: The  challenge  of  designing  biodegradable  MN  which  also  contain  the peptide-RES  load  lie  at  how  to  ensure  enough  peptide-RES  can  penetrate  across  the  dermal  through microchannels formed by MN and then diffuse deeply to subQ WAT where they specifically bind to ASCs and unload RES into ASCs. Deep microchannel formation requires long MN with strong mechanical strength. We propose our elongated MN based buried payload design: 1)  MN patches will be fabricated using the facile micro-mold replication technique for low-cost production. Commercially available  MN molds,  and particularly laser-micromachine based in-house fabrication of special MN molds will be used, from which MN with a cylindrical MN base and a pyramidal tip (Fig. 2) will be manufactured.  2)  The cylindrical base, acting as the booster of the tip payload, elongates the polymer MN height34. This base  will  penetrate  through  the  stratum  corneum  into  the  viable  epidermal  layer,  where  it  is  quickly dissolved in a few minutes and is disconnected from the peptide-RES-loaded pyramidal tip. As the base of MN, the biodegradable polymer(s) control the mechanical properties of MN. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has good mechanical strength to insert into the skin34. PVP and poly(vinyl alcohol)  mixture may further improve  the  mechanical  strength,  due  to  the  hydrogen  bonding  between  the  carbonyl  groups  in  the pyrrolidone rings of the PVP and hydroxyl groups of poly(vinyl alcohol) . They are also easily dissolvable, disconnecting from the payload tip.   3)  Peptide-RES will be loaded in the tip, encapsulated by biodegradable polymer(s) which acts as the tip backbone. Its mechanical strength, compatibility with the embedded peptide-RES, and controlled release profile  of  peptide-RES  from  MN  tip  are  some  of  the  selection  criteria.  Polylactic  acid  (PLA),  PLGA, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and their mixture are possible candidates.  4)  After the MN base boosts the payload tip into the epidermal and dermal layers and is disconnected, the payload tip can be further deeply pushed via iontophoresis, if it turns out to be necessary. 5)  With slowly dissolution of tip backbone polymer(s), peptide-RES will be now sustainedly released; with its softness and hydrophilic properties, our surface-engineered Peptide-RES should have capability to quickly diffuse into subQ, where they specifically bind to ASCs and unload RES.  Mechanical  strength  of  MN  patches  will  be  determined  using  a  universal  testing  instrument  to  obtain  the displacement-force relationship and their Youngs moduli. ParafilmM will be used as a skin simulant to examine MN insertion capability.  (ii) Transdermal delivery efficacy in obese mice and in human skins: We will purchase de-identified fresh human skins (with full thickness) from ZenBio Inc. The delivery efficacy and target specificity will be confirmed in human skins from both males and females and from various age groups. We will incorporate free RES or peptide-RES into dissolvable MNs.  (ii.a) Penetration: After treatments, the skins will be embedded into the OCT compound and sectioned into slides using a cryostat into different skin layers. RES content in skin layers and subQ WAT will be measured using the HPLC system.  (ii.b) Target specificity: We will also isolate SVF from subQ WAT. ASC cells will be labeled with antibodies and identified as CD45-CD31-/CD34+CD29+, and quantified using flow cytometry. We will also collect ASCs from subQ WAT using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) system. RES content in the ASCs will be 5  measured using the HPLC system24, 36.   (iic) Biodistribution in obese mice: Besides iWAT and  iWAT skin, we will also collect liver, kidneys, lung, spleen, and other adipose depots: gWAT, rWAT, iWAT, and iBAT. RES content in the tissues and organs will be measured using the HPLC system24, 36.   (iii) Dermatokinetics, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of peptide-RES in obese mice: C57BL/6J mice (6 mice (both sex) /treatment) will be fed a high fat diet (fat providing 45% of energy) starting from week 1 (age 7 weeks)  to  week  6 (age 12  weeks).  After that,  dissolvable  MN  patches  containing  either free  RES,  or  ASC-targeted peptide-RES conjugate will be applied to mices iWAT (one MN patch for each iWAT side). RES doses will be 16 g/patch. At 0 (control), 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h after dosing, animals will be sacrificed and samples of blood (via cardiac puncture), skin, subQ WAT, visceral WAT, iBAT, and selected host organs (heart,  liver,  lungs,  kidneys,  spleen,  and  brain)  will  be  collected  for  the  detection  and  analysis  of  RES  and possible metabolites using the established LC-MS/MS method. Treated skin areas will be embedded into OCT compounds, and sectioned horizontally into 200 m sections. RES contents in different height sections will be measured using our Agilent UPLC. The plasma and tissue samples will be stored at 80C until LC-MS/MS analyses. PK modeling will then be performed to derive parameters such as maximum concentration (Cmax), time to  reach  Cmax  (Tmax),  area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  (AUC),  half-life  (T1/2),  total  plasma  or  tissue clearance (Cls), apparent distribution volume (Vd), and rate constant of elimination phase ().   Data analysis and sample size: An independent samples t-test will be used to test the difference in tissue RES levels between the free RES and conjugate delivery methods. Statistical significance will be determined by p values < 0.05. A power analysis yielded a sample size of six in each of the two treatment groups (12 samples total) to detect the difference in g/mg protein levels, as observed in Zu et al.36, between the two treatment groups with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.  Potential difficulties and limitations: With most experimental methods established in our laboratory, the key for the whole project is on the success of transdermal delivery of RES to subQ WAT. The challenges are two aspects: MN deliver peptide-RES to the dermal layer to form peptide-RES reservoir and the peptide-RES migrate to subQ WAT. We will focus on polymer MN technique, but also monitor hollow solid MN, with its own pros and cons, as a backup plan. The major merit of hollow MN is the decoupling design of MN from peptide-RES. Using laser-based  micromachining  technique,  1-2  mm  long  MN  can  be  fabricated  to  form  deeper  transdermal microchannels,  through  which  peptide-RES  is  driven  to  subQ  via  iontophoresis.  We  have  the  capability  to fabricate such hollow MNs. Humans and mice have different skin thicknesses. For mice application, the MN height is 250 m; for human application, the MN height 800 m will be applied on purchased human skins. Aim  #2:  Determine  the  efficacy  and  target  validation  by which  ASC-targeting  peptide-RES  conjugate induces mouse and human adipose stromal cell browning.  (Zhao: lead)  Rationale: It has been reported that primary ASCs isolated from  the WAT of both mouse and human origins, including subQ WAT, express the cleaved and non-glycanated decorin , which binds to ASC-targeting peptide26, 27. Mouse ASCs are a commonly accepted preclinical browning model to study the cellular response to  browning agents in vitro. Human WAT-derived primary ASCs are the common  sources for human stem cells that can produce many functional  cell  types,  including  mature  white  adipocytes  and  brown-like  adipocytes. We  have demonstrated  that  RES  in  nanoencapsulation  enhanced  browning  effects  of  RES  in  differentiating  white adipocytes24. Therefore, we hypothesize that peptide-RES will facilitate targeted delivery of RES to ASCs and significantly enhance RES's beneficial activities. We have validated cell viability (data not shown) and targeting specificities in the 3T3-L1 overexpressing decorin and primary stromal cells from the iWAT of C57BL/6J mice. Therefore, in this aim we will investigate how peptide-RES enhances glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial uncoupling ex vivo. To do so, we will compare these functional indexes among the primary stromal cells from the subQ WAT of mice injected with peptide-RES, free RES, free peptide or the negative controls from Aim  3.  Moreover,  as  a  first  step  to  address  the  translatability  of  the  ASC-targeting  delivery  system  to  the treatment of human obesity, we will further validate peptide-RES in the primary stromal cells from human subQ WAT. We will assess cell viability and cellular uptake of the ASC-targeted RES-NPs in the human primary stromal cultures followed by testing the efficacy of peptide-RES in inducing browning, improving cellular metabolism, and suppressing  inflammation  in  the  human  primary  stromal  cells  in  comparison  with free  RES,  or the  negative controls. These studies will facilitate our future translational studies. Details of the approaches are described below. Preliminary data  6  Primary stromal cells of both mouse and human origins have been confirmed to express cleaved nonglycanated decorin  that binds to ASC-targeting peptides  26, 27. However, it has been reported that decorin expression decreases  after  the  cells  were  isolated  and  plated  in  vitro26.  Therefore,  we  have  conducted  experiments  to examine  the  decorin  protein  expression  in  isolated  murine  stromal  cells  at  various  stages  of  the  in  vitro differentiation  process:  after  being  plated,  reaching  confluence,  and  being  treated  to  induce  differentiation. Protein expression of decorin, glycanated (gDecorin), and non-glycanated decorin (ngDecorin) in the SVF pellet (SVF), plated for 2 days (2-day Plating), confluent (Conflu.), and differentiating stromal cells (stimulated with adipogenic agents for 3 days) (3-day Diff.) were measured by Western blotting. We found that decorin protein expression was recovered after two-day plating and reached the same levels as in fresh SVF (Fig. 5A). Moreover, we have validated the presence of both the core and cleaved nonglycanated decorin protein at the confluence (day 0 or D0), day 4 (D4), day 8 (D8), and day 14 (D14) during adipocyte differentiation of the human primary stromal cells isolated from the subQ WAT of an obese female individual (L072709) (BMI 38 and age 39 years and an obese female individual with type 2 diabetes (DL011906) (BMI 34.1 and age 62 years old) (Fig. 5D). Protein expression of the differentiation marker genes (transcriptional factor C/EBP and lipid-binding protein FABP4)  are  shown  to  indicate good  differentiation  in  parallel  with  decorin  protein  expression  in the  primary stromal  cells  from  L072709  (Fig.  5C).  A  similar  degree  of  differentiation  was  achieved  from  SL0031  and DL011906 lot (Data not shown). After differentiation, according to Zenbio's instructions, the stromal cells were old) (Fig. 5B), a pool of overweight females (SL0031) (BMI range 25.2-29.4 and age range 26-60 years old),  converted  into  mature  adipocytes  with  morphological  (i.e.,  round  shape  with  lipid  droplets)  and  functional characteristics (i.e., insulin dependent glucose uptake) resemble those of mature adipocytes in vivo. The findings that two forms of nonglycanated decorin protein were present during the whole 14-day differentiation process (as indicated in D0, D4, D8, and D14) enable us to test this targeted delivery strategy in the browning process. To confirm whether targeted delivery enhances the uptake in human primary stromal cells, the human primary stromal cells from the SL0031 lot were treated with Rhoda-labeled NPs at 37C for 2 hrs after plated and cultured for 4 days as preadipocytes. Consistent with mouse iWAT stromal cells results, ASC-targeted NPs compared to non-targeted NPs had more than 10-fold higher binding and uptake by the human primary ASCs isolated from subQ WAT (Fig. 5E), demonstrating the targeting specificity and efficiency of ASC-targeted NPs to human ASCs. The unpublished data were generated by Drs. Zhao and Wang.

C/EBP and FABP4 are differentiation markers and ERK1/2 is the loading control Methods  (i) Ex vivo experiment: Six (6) mice per group per sex from each of the prevention and therapeutic studies will be randomly selected. The subQ WAT or BAT will be dissected from selected mice, and primary stromal cells will be isolated as described below. Isolation of SVF will be performed following standard procedures with minor modifications  as  described39.  Briefly,  fat  pads  are  minced  with  scissors  and  added  to  isolation  buffer supplemented with type 1 collagenase at suggested concentrations. Digested tissues are filtered through 100 m nylon mesh to get single-cell suspension. After centrifugation, floating mature adipocytes are collected and washed twice with isolation buffer. Cells are counted and plated into 6-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, unattached cells are removed by extensive washing with 1XPBS. The attached cells are pooled per group per sex, counted, and seeded onto XF24 cell culture plates. Mitochondrial uncoupler, glucose uptake, and fatty acid oxidation will be measured according to the manufacturer's instructions.  (ii) Human primary cell isolation, culturing, and differentiation: We will purchase primary adipose stromal cells from human fat from ZenBio Inc. and Lonza Walkersville, Inc. They specialize in human adipose-derived stromal  cells  and  other  related  products.  Human  primary  stromal  cells  from  various  WAT  depots  and  both genders and different adiposity (BMI) ranges will be tested. We will purchase human adipose stromal cells from 12 individuals per sex (2 levels) by BMI range (4 levels: 25-29.9; 30-34.9; 35-39.9; 40-45), for a total of 96 individuals;  we  will  also  adjust  for  age  and  type  2  diabetes  status,  but  we  expect  natural  diversity  in  those 7  covariates, so there is no need to cross on them in the design.

For this purpose, we will analyze the weekly product movement data (sales volume data) provided by our grocery store chain partner, Bashas Food City Stores. We will also collect information on strategies schools (monthly) and stores (bi-weekly) adopt for cross-promoting fruits and vegetables. Learning logs and stakeholder feedback will be used to document the processes involved in setting up and maintaining the public private partnership. We will create a report to summarize the process of developing a public private partnership between FFVP schools and stores, and to describe its impact on store sales and fruit and vegetable promotion. This report will be disseminated through our networks and partners at the Arizona Department of Education (ADE) and at the International Fresh Produce Association. Our long-term goals are to inform FFVP implementation guidelines at the ADE and the USDA that support cross-sector community collaborations such as the development of public-private partnerships and to amplify the impact of the FFVP.",
FP00032258,727,,,,,1,,,"The Arizona State University College of Health Solutions proposes a Public Health Informatics Training (PHIT) Core to train public health informatics and technology professionals across Arizona to create a more robust local public health informatics infrastructure, emphasizing underserved communities and underrepresented minorities (URM). This workforce training program will leverage the scientific and community-engaged strengths of our college and the public health ecosystem in Arizona to provide enhanced informatics training to meet the workforce needs of our state, with a strong focus on increasing racial and ethnic minority representation in the field of public health informatics.BackgroundBiomedical informatics and data science has become one of the most active and exciting research areas in biomedical and health sciences, bringing unprecedented opportunities that combine computing, statistics, and information sciences to address the challenges in translational biomedical research, patient care, healthcare delivery systems, as well as community, population, and public health. The proposed Arizona State University College of Health Solutions PHIT Core will leverage our strong graduate degree programs, bring various expertise and resources from across our College to enhance the curriculum, and consolidate the training and career pathways for degree-pursuing and short-term trainees with diverse backgrounds.Community EngagementThe strength of our proposed public health informatics core grows out of our Colleges deep connections with communities across Arizona and with state and local public health infrastructure. These connections were examined recently during a planning process for a prior informatics grant proposal. As part of that effort, researchers at our College conducted interviews and focus groups with 45 key public health leaders and informatics specialists. The results indicated a significant shortage of persons trained in public health informatics throughout Arizona, as well as nationally, with several persistent themes, including: a lack of trained staff to provide public health informatics, difficulty in recruiting staff for open positions, and a shortage of trained informatics staff from URM. This is consistent with a 2017 national survey of public health departments, in which 51% of agencies reported data technology expertise as one of the most needed skills for new hires. Built into PHITs design will be our relationship with our Colleges Community Advisory Board (CAB). PHIC will work closely with our Colleges CAB to provide strategic guidance on the proposed training program, including how to leverage the latest development in biomedical informatics and data science training, potential faculty expertise and training resources across the nation, and new initiatives from the partner organizations for the good of broader Arizona communities (with a focus on recruiting individuals from underrepresented groups into the Program). Members of the CAB include a broad cross section of public health leaders in the greater Phoenix area.ASU is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) with the first undergraduate biomedical informatics (BMI) program in the country. ASU has a large informatics student base to facilitate rapid program startup. ASU also has a strong record of overall success in recruitment, graduation rates, financial support, and career placement, with particular accomplishments among Latino students (n = 29,000) and Native American students (n = 3,400) enrollment in Fall 2020. ASU is deeply rooted in community engagement, and we will prioritize training for URM students as well as promote long-term sustainability beyond the grant period.",

FP00032282,729,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARYOverview:There is a broad trend in governance and public administration to reorganize social service provisioning systems from being coordinated around specific provisions (education, safety, health) to being organized around the individual, arrangements referred to as systems of care. The distributed and integrated nature of these systems results in novel threats and opportunities to attend to accountabilities of individual parts of the system and the system in its entirety. Part One of our proposal builds off of existing theory, multiple previous grants, and our experience in designing and executing software systems with a public intent to identify and map threats to accountability that can be anticipated within the socio-computational ecosystem of systems of care. While compliance includes accountabilities to laws, regulations, citizen expectations, and social norms, we seek to provide a more robust set of practices through which systems of care can serve the needs of diverse audiences, mitigate instead of exacerbate the consequences of bias, and provide a culture of stewardship across these systems that is adaptive, responsive, effective, efficient, and ethically designed and deployed. Part One will understand the dynamics of how bias might propagate across the system through a variety of channels including regulations, social contexts, data, and lack of representation in the software development process, among others. Part Two explores how to attend to the neglect through a series of interventions conducted in collaboration with community members including mapping the system, convergence workshops, algorithmic impact assessments, and computational analytic techniques that can augment governance opportunities in the design and deployment of these systems of care. An outcome measure we will track through this process is the effectiveness of a system at responding to both individual-level threats as well as the possibility for a type of herd level immunity to bias at the systems level through shared stewardship and accountability. The type of products we expect to generate because of this research are advances in theory (articulation of novel threats, new understandings of dynamics & treatments), specific products related to an algorithmic accountability policy toolkit, and practical guidelines for customizable local use cases.  Intellectual Merit:Many smart cities projects fall short of their full potential, resulting in distorted data, misleading conclusions and unused systems. There are long-standing, unsolved challenges with empowering publics in municipal decision-making, and new technologies often arrive without foreknowledge of government or citizens, or bilateral communication between cities and companies. Processes focus more on the potential of technologies and less on the histories, and needs of communities. The proposed work addresses this gap by studying processes of knowledge convergence to improve civic participation in the development and integration of systems of care for communities. A key outcome of this proposal is to understand the influence of processes inspired by justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) to intentionally check bias and reduce disparities in the design and application of public service provisioning software systems. To ground our research in a practical application, we will be testing these interventions in a site of both need and opportunity. Regarding need, the Peoria, Illinois region was named the worst city for African Americans to live in 2016. Regarding opportunity, Peorias local service agencies have invited us into participate in designing and implementing a system of care for their social service provisioning. The goal of this research is to advance accountable software systems through developing generalizable and localizable practices for exploring how to identify specific and systemic sources of bias, improve public service provisioning outcomes, and minimize disparities from biased program outcomes.  Broader Impacts:The proposed research has the potential to generally improve the uptake of a wide range of public-facing smarter cities technologies. The participatory methodology for civic participation in the design, refinement, and implementation (or lack thereof) of smart and connected technologies would be published to give other cities opportunities to apply the methodology to their systems of care, as well as to novel smart and connected technologies. Broad uptake of this suite of methods would generate new insights about civic technology adoption, augmented governance approaches, smart city transitions, and systems of care. The proposed research would offer insights about integrative research in these innovative academic-municipal settings, with potential applications for Peoria or other cities.  ",
FP00032295,730,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  For many, midlife  the period spanning roughly 40-60 years of age  is a challenging period in which stressors related to career, child-rearing, caregiving for parents and others, and community responsibilities converge, and some aspects of well-being reach their lowest adult levels. During the same period, risk of significant health problems such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and cancer is rising. Much evidence indicates these are connected: stress and distress impact physical health through direct biological mechanisms, and also by impeding efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle  the focus of the present proposal. Trajectories of both psychological well-being and physical health vary considerably during midlife, indicating likely risk and resilience factors in need of research attention. Healthy, effective emotion regulation/coping skills may be one potent resilience factor. Growing evidence suggests that emotion regulation has the potential to break the link between stress/distress and unhealthy behavior (e.g., smoking and alcohol use, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise), as well as promoting mental health and well-being. Moreover, a rich body of basic behavioral science points toward a limited number of specific emotion regulation strategies that are particularly effective in reducing distress and promoting mental health. However, emotion regulations potential as a mechanism for promoting healthy behavior, as well as mental health and well-being, in the general midlife population is yet to be rigorously investigated and translated into intervention. The proposed project comprises Stage 1A and 1B within the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development (Onken et al., 2014), developing and pilot testing a new, single-session, fully online emotion regulation training program for the general midlife population: The Midlife Emotion Regulation Toolkit. The program builds on PI Shiotas prior Stage 0 research investigating implications of specific emotion regulation strategies for well-being, while emphasizing the value of emotion regulation flexibility  the ability to identify and flexibly deploy different emotion regulation strategies based on the current situational context. Co-I Berkel brings extensive experience in behavioral intervention development and evaluation to the team. Aim 1 of the project focuses on program development, with multiple cycles of user feedback and refinement, comparing options for a brief and widely accessible yet acceptable, appropriate, and usable intervention program. Aim 2 of the project focuses on pilot feasibility and efficacy testing, via short-term randomized controlled trial, of the programs effects on emotion regulation strategy use (a mechanism-level effect), well-being, anxiety, depression, stress, sleep, diet, exercise, and smoking and alcohol use (all relative to baseline) in the week following participation.

FP00032297,731,,,,,1,,,"Overview:  This project aims to develop experimental and modeling methods that quantify how wearable robots impact worker thermal comfort and safety. Such devices can prevent musculoskeletal injuries and, in many cases, also decrease the users metabolic effort. However, the performance of wearable robots is currently only tested in cold to temperate environments. Even in such conditions, thermal discomfort at the wearable-body interfaces is cited as a major factor in disuse of the devices. The attachment of the devices locally reduces the users ability to cool by covering skin with thermal insulation that prevents sweat evaporation. In the case of powered devices, the user can also absorb some of the generated heat. In warm-to-hot conditions, these features could cause discomfort and contribute to the onset of heat illness. On the other hand, wearable robot use can reduce metabolic cost while paying for their weight penalty, which according to our preliminary calculations could even double thermally-safe working time in warm-to-hot conditions. However, currently there are no methods to systematically evaluate and optimize such thermal aspects of wearable robots. We will address this knowledge gap by leveraging our wearable robotics, physiological, and thermal sciences expertise and new climate chamber and state-of-the-art thermal manikin facilities. Specifically, we will: 1) quantify male and female physiological and subjective thermal responses during lifting with and without a back assisting exoskeleton in temperate, warm, and hot conditions, 2) measure heat transfer during direct skin-body interface contact, and develop corresponding theoretical and physical (artificial skin) models, and 3) develop physical (thermal manikin) and computational (thermophysiological model) platforms for assessing a wearable robots impact on human comfort and physiology in diverse conditions. Compared to human trials, the two platforms will be simpler, cheaper, less variable, and faster ways to evaluate and optimize the thermal impacts of exoskeleton designs. Intellectual Merit:  This project will provide the first comprehensive trials of exoskeleton use by male and female subjects in warm and hot conditions. We will use the results of these trials (e.g., skin and core temperature evolution during lifting with and without a back-supporting exoskeleton) to benchmark the two proposed platforms. To lay the foundation for these platforms, we will conduct a thermophysiological analysis of cyclic lifting-walking motion with back exoskeletons. Most exoskeletons have multiple large body attachment areas, so they also have substantial potential to cause thermal discomfort. To accurately mimic the lifting-walking process, we will measure direct skin contact conductive and localized, motion-enhanced convective heat transfer. Based on these measurements, we will develop a general theoretical model and experimental artificial skin that accurately represent direct heat transfer between the skin and a wide array of materials used in wearable body interfaces. These models and benchmarking measurements will address knowledge gaps surrounding thermal contact resistance between two soft materials with low to moderate thermal conductivity. The theoretical model of skin contact will be integrated as a boundary condition into the thermal physiology and comfort human simulation. In turn, the artificial skin will be integrated with our NSF MRI-funded thermal manikin instrument.  Broader impacts:  This work will initiate a more holistic approach to the design and evaluation of wearable robots that include thermal comfort and safety issues besides the predominant biomechanical aspects. The developed methods can be used to optimize the design of the body interface areas. The resulting improvement of user thermal comfort can eliminate a major reason for the disuse of the devices in industrial settings. In addition, for diverse industry sectors such as agriculture, construction, and manufacturing that are often conducted in warm and hot settings, the improved design of exoskeletons might reduce worker thermal stress, prevent curbing of working periods during hotter weather and/or decrease the cumulative heat stress. Thus, this approach might help alleviate one of the major economic and health impacts of more frequent and severe extreme heat periods associated with climate change.  We will also engage the general population and industry through multimedia, open houses, and Wearable Robotics Conference demonstrations involving wearable robots and the thermal manikin.

Therefore, training the workforce for AD/ADRD research requires an interdisciplinary approach that is informed by community and clinical need, which is in turn critical to rapid translation of fundamental research into practice and communities. This proposal aims at developing an interdisciplinary training program for nurturing six predoctoral fellows annually, who will be mentored by a team of faculty from different units/schools at Arizona State University and clinicians/researchers from Mayo Clinic, Banner Alzheimer Institute, and Barrow Neurological Institute, with diverse expertise covering AD/ADRD clinical science, diagnostics and engineering, disease biology, data science, and drug discovery/development. The training program will leverage AD/ADRD resources in Arizona and actively engage the Arizona Alzheimers Consortium (AAC) and Arizona Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). In addition, the program is in a unique position to partner with Mirabella, a senior living community on the ASU campus, and Hospice of the Valley, Arizona's leading provider of end-of-life care, to provide the trainees with real-life experiences. The program employs four components for training the students: curriculum-based training, research training, career development, and community interaction and outreach. Recognizing the exponentially increasing amount of data in all disciplines involved in AD/ADRD research and the critical and often enabling role Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays in data-intensive research, the proposed training program employs a data-centric approach with AI being a bridge serving to connect all the involved disciplines through its role as a data processing and inference engine. Accordingly, the focus of the proposed curriculum-based training and research training is on helping the trainee to gain the fundamental knowledge and research skills in employing AI for AD/ADRD research. The training faculty have established track record, not only for pursing AD/ADRD research, but also for doctoral student training. Further, there are active collaborations among the training faculty.

FP00032424,737,,,,,1,,,"Working Title: Closing the Gap in Pediatric Eye Care: A Network Adequacy StudyStudy Team: Dr. Swapna Reddy (co-PI), Dr. Rizwana Biviji (co-PI), Nikita Vora (Emory undergraduate student), Cindy Reynolds (ASU graduate student)Project Timeline: April 2022 - August 2022Timeline: Field work start in April 2022- complete in June 2022Purpose:According to the National Center for Childrens Vision and Eye Health, up to 28% of school-age children have vision problems that may impact their ability to develop, learn and acquire literacy and reading skills. It is expected that the rate of vision problems in children will continue to increase due to the rising incidence of myopia, also known as nearsightedness.The primary aim of the study is to determine where pediatric eye care network adequacy (capacity to provide local vision services for children) exists and where there are gaps in eye care for children. Network adequacy is defined by the extent services are accessible by region, type of care available (Optometry/Ophthalmology), payment accepted (insurance), ages served, and in which languages services are offered.Inadequate networks can prevent pediatric patients from being able to see the eye care providers that they trust and depend upon. Facilitating access to routine and recommended eye care screenings and services for children is imperative to achieve overall improved health outcomes, educational achievements and reduce health disparities. To improve our understanding of the gaps in eye care for children and how to reduce those gaps, we will conduct a study of network adequacy among professionals holding themselves out as pediatric eye care providers in Arizona. This study will test multiple components of childrens access to eye care, including reliability of provider directory information, appointment availability at the practice level for children covered under Medicaid versus commercial insurance, language access and compliance with regulatory standards. We will contact business practices where listed professionals provide eye care services, following a standardized interview script to be conducted by student researchers and aimed at office staff (practice schedulers and representatives). The variables of interest are: (i) time until the next available appointment, (ii) if the practice was reached, (iii) if the practice accepts a specific insurance plan, (iv) variances in appointment availability by plan, (v) language services offered, (vi) region of practice, (vii) ages served and (viii) types of care available. We intend to utilize a census approach to identify, catalog, and attempt to call all of the unique practices identified in the inclusion criteria across Arizona. Study results will be used by Eyes on Learning (EOL) coalition partners, the EOL Advisory Board and other vision experts and advocates to inform the strategic activities of the Eyes On Learning coalition and target efforts to improve childrens vision health in Arizona.Methodology: ASU researchers will conduct an initial and thorough literature review on the overall issue nationally and if available, in Arizona. Next, the ASU research team will connect with the Arizona Medical Board, Arizona Board of Optometry and Arizona Osteopathic Medical Association for updated lists of practicing ophthalmologists (MD and DO) and optometrists in Arizona, determine groups or practices for listed and active providers and connect with all listed practices via a secret shopper survey to determine network adequacy and access to care by examining the study variables of (i) time until the next two available appointments, (ii) if the practice was reached, (iii) identifying accepted plans, (iv) variances in appointment availability by plan (especially public vs. private), (v) language services offered, (vi) region of practice, (vii) ages served and (viii) types of care available. The survey will be developed in accordance with ASU Institutional Review Board standards. Data Collection and Procedures-1.In order to capture the most comprehensive data to avoid duplication between providers, we will collapse the list of individual providers provided by the Arizona Medical Board, Arizona Board of Optometry and Arizona Osteopathic Medical Association to listed business practices in the state of Arizona. First, we will review the mailing address to identify all providers working at that business practice. Second, we will contact all practices on the list and include a question in our script during the phone interview whether the provider serves children and what age group. If the provider serves children (birth to 18 years), we will proceed with setting an appointment as part of the secret shopper methodology.  Otherwise, we will list the practice as serving adults only. 2.Secret Shopper Approach: The research team will administer a secret shopper survey and mimic real-world scenarios to test network adequacy. Within this methodology researchers pose as parents wanting to set appointments for their children and have either a private insurance plan or Medicaid. This methodology has been successfully employed by studies such as Steinman et al. (2012), Cama et al. (2017) and Reddy et al. (2022). Studies have shown that the use of mystery shoppers eliminates the hawthorne effect present when healthcare staff are aware they are being monitored (Steinman et al., 2012). The study would therefore mimic a real-world situation when a patient is trying to schedule an appointment with a provider, effectively testing if the provider in fact offers care within the networks that they hold out to serve, while also examining the aforementioned layers of access.   3.Sample size: a.

FP00032448,738,,,,,1,,,"Purpose: The purpose of this work is to ensure that firefighters working in wildland areas under extreme and seasonally variable environmental conditions are properly hydrated for optimal firefighting capability. Aims: 1) Assess seasonal variation in fluid intake and hydration status in wildland firefighters (WLFs) in the southwest U.S., while mapping fluid intake strategies, heat-related symptoms, illnesses, and readiness concerning heat, health, and safety; 2) Determine if WLFs can accurately self-assess their hydration status in moderate and hot conditions; 3) Examine if self-monitoring with newly developed education and instruction for self-assessment (EDU) improves hydration status in an applied field setting. Relevance: Wildland firefighters experience a high level of heat stress, especially in the hot environmental conditions of the southwest, which causes discomfort and physiological strain. These issues result in serious health risks and impaired work performance, especially when in a sub-optimally hydrated state. The assessment of hydration status in WLFs leans heavily on practical measurements, such as body weight change and urine color (Uc) as markers of chronic hypohydration. However, the study of the nature and use of proper educational and standardized implementation strategies, such as instructions for urine collection and for the assessment of Uc, to ensure high accuracy of these methods, is lacking in the literature and therefore not advocated in practice. Methods: This study will be performed in the Phoenix, AZ area with a targeted population of n=138 WLFs based at Tonto National Forest. During Year 1, observations will be taken four times (i.e., during moderate, hot, moderate, and cold temperatures) to assess hydration status based on morning urine samples using urine specific gravity (USG). Additionally, using a questionnaire (Aim 1), we will collect data on self-reported fluid intake for insight into elements influencing hydration status and readiness concerning the heat. Further, data on potential hydration self-assessment status markers, such as Uc, urine frequency, thirst, and change in body weight, will be collected, in Year 1 and compared with urine concentration to determine accuracy in classifying urine samples in terms of low vs. a high urine concentration (Aim 2). Year 2 will consist of a randomized controlled trial in moderate and hot condition, in which the effect of education and instruction (EDU) vs. no intervention (CON) in WLFS is evaluated concerning the effect on hydration status and fluid intake (Aim 3). The EDU WLFs will receive education and instruction including our knowledge about the combination of hydration self-assessment methods while the CON WLFs will not. We will assess changes in hydration status and fluid intake between groups and assessment periods and WLFs apply hydration self-assessment strategies for influencing hydration status. For this purpose, we will analyze morning urine samples from all WLFs. Water intake will be measured by having WLF drink a small amount of heavy water containing deuterium oxide (D2O), a harmless non-radioactive stable isotope, which is the gold standard method for determining water intake over multiple days. At the same time, these urine samples will be used to assess hydration status by measuring urine specific gravity. Anticipated outcomes: This project will provide evidence for the efficacy of practical tools to identify and improve the hydration status of the WLFs. Optimizing hydration status will aid WLFs in reducing fatigue on the job, as well as improving heat readiness and injury risk throughout the year.",

Furthermore, speech production is a cognitively taxing task that requires activation of a distributed neuronal network in the brain; therefore, the hypothesis is that any disturbances to this network due to the presence of a disease will manifest as a change in the speech signal. One of the promises of AI in this context is the potential for using the speech signal to detect an underlying neurological disease by training a classification model to predict a clinical diagnosis.

Research applicationsApproximately 2 million Americans have communication impairments due to a brain injury, such as stroke.[2] The inability to communicate effectively is the strongest predictor of reduced quality of life and self-sufficiency after a stroke, and also is a top predictor of increased caregiver burnout and the need for long-term residential care.[3-6] Yet, outcomes from traditional speech therapy approaches are very often ineffective in severe cases,[7] and are often inaccessible to those who need it most (e.g. transportation, high out-of-pocket costs, frustration, etc.).[8] Thus, there is a dire need for accessible, effective, speech rehabilitation approaches. This project would be the largest study (by far) to date [1] to determine the efficacy of aphasia choirs- a low-cost, high-interest avenue for speech rehabilitation to complement traditional speech therapies. Thus, our findings would have great impact in the following areas: (1) quantify the effects of aphasia choirs on multiple dimensions of well-being and rehabilitation to maximize aphasia choir efficacy, and (2) identify specific ways to increase access to the potential benefits of aphasia choirs. 4. MethodologyWe propose three studies, which are described below. All behavioral data will be collected remotely, using methods currently being implemented by Dr. Rogalsky and her collaborators. Recent studies indicate that remote behavioral testing of individuals with aphasia using devices they already have in their home, when following best practices, is effective and accurate. [9] If Headphones with a sufficient microphone attached will be shipped / delivered to participants if needed, following procedures already optimized in Dr. Rogalskys lab. MRI data collection, for which Dr. Rogalsky has ample experience, will take place at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, using functional and structural MRI protocols already optimized by Dr. Rogalsky and collaborators. [11-14]Participants: Participants in the experiments described below will be 18 years or older (average age of stroke survivors is often ~60 years of age) and recruited based on a clinical diagnosis of post-stroke aphasia at least 6 months prior. Participants will be recruited from two primary sources: (1) ASU Stroke & Aphasia Registry. Maintained by Dr. Rogalskys lab, the Registry currently boasts >60 stroke survivors with aphasia who meet the present studys inclusion criteria. The Registry continues to expand due in large part to collaborating with ASUs Speech Clinic, directed by collaborator Joshua Breger, MS SLP-CCC. (2) Sing Aphasias national aphasia choir programs. Sing Aphasia, a non-profit organization founded by collaborator Dr. Gillian Velmer, SLPD-CCC, hosts both weekly in-person and virtual aphasia choirs.Study 1: Effects of aphasia choir on speech, quality of life, and neural circuitry45 individuals with aphasia who are about to join an aphasia choir, and 45 individuals with aphasia who do NOT participate in an aphasia choir will complete standardized assessments of linguistic, cognitive, social, and emotional abilities, as well as overall quality of life. Both objective and self-report measures will be collected. Participants will be assessed within one month of beginning aphasia choir participation, and then 6-9 months later (or just 6-9 months apart for the control participants who are not in an aphasia choir). All participants will continue their standard of care therapy sessions, if any. Participation in an aphasia choir will be defined as attending a minimum of once a week choir rehearsal, lasting 60-120 minutes in duration, that involve musical accompaniment (typically piano or guitar). We hypothesize that aphasia choir experience will be associated not only with improved speech fluency, but improved self-reporting of mood and quality of life.15 participants, prior to any aphasia choir participation, who are local to the Phoenix metro area (i.e. from the ASU Stroke and Aphasia Registry) will undergo a functional and structural MRI protocol at both time points (pre- and post- 6-9 months of aphasia choir). Previous speech rehabilitation research indicates that speech rehabilitation sessions over this time period can yield functional and structural brain changes that can be detected via MRI. [15] We hypothesize that well-characterized speech networks will exhibit increased connectivity from the first time point to after 6-9 months of aphasia choir participation  suggesting that these networks have been strengthened via aphasia choir participation. We also hypothesize that other brain networks, such as the well-studied default-mode network which has been shown to be sensitive to improved mood and mental health, will also exhibit increased connectivity. [17] The effects of possible covariates, including age, time post-stroke, aphasia severity, previous music training, and intensity of aphasia choir practice also will be examined.Study 2: Identification of barriers to aphasia choir participationAll participants from Study 1 (n=90) also will complete an online survey to assess their level of interest in different types of group singing activities, desired areas of improvement if currently participating in an aphasia choir, and potential roadblocks to participating in group singing activities (e.g. lack of transportation or technology, social anxiety, music preferences, etc.). We hypothesize that there will be significant interest in aphasia choirs in the control group, and that group differences will be present in the potential accessibility of aphasia choirs, and on social anxiety measures. We will utilize online data management tools such as REDCap and Qualitrics to securely implement and organize the survey in a very user-friendly manner. The results of this study will identify the specific roadblocks to aphasia choir participation, which clinicians can then possibly mitigate (e.g. hosting a bilingual choir, a virtual choir via an app that could be anonymous, inclusion of mental health counselors to advise the choir leaders, etc). Study 3: Identification of the most effective elements of aphasia choirs on speechMany individuals with aphasia have impaired auditory-motor feedback systems, such that they are unable to correct their own speech errors [refs]. When singing as part of a group, the individuals feedback of their own voice is combined with that of the other singers, likely masking the individuals own feedback, but providing a stronger, more vivid percept of the words the individual is attempting to sing. We hypothesize that the group feedback heard and seen when singing with a group provide significant benefits to increasing the fluency of individuals with aphasia during group singing, but that these benefits may not extend to speech in exactly the same way. To investigate these hypotheses, a subset of 30 individuals with aphasia who participated in Study #1 (15 with aphasia choir experience, 15 without) will complete song and speech repetition tasks Dr. Rogalsky has used previously [10,16] under several conditions: just masking out the individuals own voice, masking plus simulated group auditory feedback, visual feedback, or both auditory and visual feedback. Performance on these singing and speaking tasks will be compared to each other and to the individuals performance on the cognitive, linguistic, and social-emotional measures collected in study #1. Results will identify specific aspects of group singing that are most important to improve fluency, and how those factors affect speaking with or without aphasia choir experience.5.

FP00032515,742,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY  The enormous wealth of biological data enabled by the NIH Common Fund has provided unprecedented opportunities for the interdisciplinary study of human health. However, this possibility is limited by the difficulty in cross-dataset integration. To address this problem, we suggest developing a bioinformatic bridge that connects heterogeneous datasets through a common omic. Fortunately, most Common Fund datasets have a shared omic: host genes and their transcriptional abundance. In fact, any type of omic data that interacts with host gene transcriptional regulation could be brought into the bridge framework, and the data can be correlated independently from the original samples. Using this principle, we will connect the microbiome and the metabolometwo omics with critical but insufficiently studied roles in many human health conditions. We will apply this strategy to the study of the microbe-metabolite-host gene transcription (MMT) regulatory axis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), two gastrointestinal diseases strongly associated with host-microbe interactions. We propose to develop two computational methods, both aiming to integrate heterogeneous datasets by using host gene expression levels as an intermediate layer: MMT-cor aims at omic-scale screening for potential correlations between different data types. MMT-reg leverages host transcriptomes to discover microbes and metabolites serving as co-factors that affect host transcriptional regulation. The two methods will be integrated and applied to seven Common Fund datasets to infer correlations among host genes, metabolites and microbiota. The results will be compared to understand their advantages and limitations. Selected MMT instances with biological significance will be experimentally validated using a cancer cell line. Our method will reveal biological connections that were otherwise undetectable using a single omic or cohort, and enable the discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for disease treatment. Our methodology will not only assist researchers who aim at integrating other Common Fund datasets, but enable cross-cohort data integration across thousands of publicly available datasets. ",
FP00032554,743,,,,,1,,,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remains a prevalent sleep disorder affecting 9-38% of the general population when defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of =5 events/hr.1 The gold standard treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP), which effectively reduces AHI and other OSA-related symptoms; however, patient adherence remains challenging. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral scientists, sleep clinicians, and engineers from Arizona State University (ASU) and Mayo Clinic Centers for Sleep Medicine (MCCSM) recently developed and tested the feasibility of a clinically-focused mobile health (mHealth) application called SleepWell24, which integrates (in real-time) CPAP and consumer wearable device data with evidence-based chronic disease self-management tools to support CPAP adoption and adherence [R21NR016046; NCT03156283]. This application proposes to address this critical adherence issue by enhancing SleepWell24, using control systems engineering concepts, into a precision medicine, adaptive, lifestyle-based intervention that optimizes long-term CPAP adherence and health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients newly-diagnosed with OSA and prescribed CPAP. We will build a dynamical model from prior SleepWell24 trial data to be evaluated in a 60-day trial focusing on optimizing initial CPAP adoption and a 6-month trial focusing on optimizing long-term CPAP adherence and quality of life (n=20 each).",

FP00032744,746,,,,,1,,,"Even as we continue to endure the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still a need to monitor threats from other viruses with pandemic potential. This includes avian influenza (AI) viruses, which have shown the ability to infect humans in isolated cases. In recent years, there have been a number of unprecedented and concerning shifts in global AI epidemiology, which indicates there is now a greater need to evaluate AI pandemic emergence and risk. An unparalleled number of AI strains have emerged in the last decade compared to any time previously in history. Concurrent and ongoing outbreaks of AI in poultry have been reported in an increasing number of countries, in Asia, Africa, the Americas, Middle East and Europe. The likelihood of a major influenza pandemic occurring is increased given this unprecedented rise in AI outbreaks in birds around the world and the number of zoonotic AI serotypes. In addition, travel and globalization mean that infections arising in one country can spread rapidly around the globe, and therefore risk assessment, early epidemic detection and mitigation are important in reducing global risk. However, it is difficult to predict when and where the next pandemic strain will emerge let alone predict how it will spread as there are a large number of factors which could contribute to an emergence. In this project, we will develop a novel risk assessment framework which integrates different types of methodologies and data for evaluating the emergence of human transmissible AI. Here, we will use Vietnam with the population of more than 95 million people, as a case study. While much of the attention regarding AI has been on China, Vietnam has historically been affected by many emerging infections, including the SARS epidemic of 2003 and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 avian influenza. It shares borders with China, Laos and Cambodia, also high-risk countries for emerging infections. We hypothesize that combining genetic and Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered (SIR) approaches for predicting AI pandemic risk will provide policymakers with a highly useful tool for identifying areas at risk of AI pandemic emergence and predicting how the virus will likely spread over time.Our specific aims are to: Develop serological, genetic, and epidemiological datasets for AI surveillance in Vietnam (Aim 1); Use these data as input into our models for assessing risk (Aim 2). Here, we will develop a risk modeling framework which utilizes phylogeography, spatial, and deterministic approaches; Develop a web portal and system architecture for our risk modeling framework and perform stakeholder engagement and evaluation (Aim 3). As part of this effort, we will conduct policy development workshops with Vietnamese officials to evaluate our risk models for AI planning and surveillance at the population level. Our project is strengthened by collaboration with a major Vietnamese surveillance institute that enables usto build capacity and enhance infectious disease modeling in Vietnam.",
FP00032764,747,,,,,1,,,"Background: Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR CA) may account for 10% of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) cases, but it is underdiagnosed due to barriers at the provider and healthcare system levels. It is important to understand the size of this performance gap as well as design strategies to close the gap.  Significance: This project will fill in a gap in our understanding of the CA disease burden and CA screening gap amongst veterans.  In parallel with the implementation, we will measure facilitators and barriers to CA screening.  Furthermore, project will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a provider-directed intervention as part of a population screening program. Innovation and impact: To our knowledge, this is the first pragmatic implementation to improve screening and diagnosis of CA in the VA.  This project takes advantage of a time-sensitive opportunity because CA screening and treatment are recent innovations and poised to expand significantly.  Veterans with HF who have undiagnosed CA are likely to directly benefit from the intervention due to greater CA detection and subsequent treatment.",
FP00032774,748,,,,,1,,,"Significance. Physical inactivity is a primary risk factor for obesity,  heart disease,  stroke,  several cancers, ,  and Type II diabetes.  Most adults are inactive, and this deficiency in physical activity (PA) has not changed meaningfully for the US population over the last two decades. Lack of PA is partially due to hostile pedestrian environments, sedentary car-dependent lifestyles, and sprawling urban environments.  Causal relationships between the built environment, PA, and overall cardiometabolic health have been documented.  While the evidence accumulates, tools to inform community and governmental decision-making for investments remain severely limited. To date, few evidence-based tools exist to quantify and predict the PA and health impacts of community-based transportation investments, land use decisions, and related air pollution exposures. This absence hinders the ability to prioritize and optimize urban design solutions based on predicted health outcomes and associated costs and benefits. Scientific advancements make this now possible and create the potential for a marketable commercial tool to integrate health considerations into the work of transportation and land use planners, private developers, financial lenders, community groups, and elected decision-makers.Preliminary Work & Phase 1 Goals. Urban Design 4 Health (UD4H) has produced and piloted the National Public Health Assessment Model (N-PHAM), a spatially scalable web-application. It captures the fine spatial granularity required to simulate small area relationships between the built, natural, and social environments, and health behaviors and chronic disease outcomes, including obesity, heart disease, and Type II diabetes. N-PHAM has been applied in 11 North American cities to support public and private agencies in conducting health-related impact analyses of transportation and land use changes. It is peer-reviewed , ,  and methodologically grounded in an ecological framework.  N-PHAM provides a framework and platform to build upon and leverage. Proposed improvements include innovative detection and automation of pedestrian-scale streetscape design features from digital imagery, and assessment of their collective impact with larger-scale walkability metrics on health outcomes and related costs. Pedestrian environment features are cost-effective investments to make places more walkable. Partnering with Dr. Adams we propose to integrate several pedestrian environment features (PEF) (e.g., presence of sidewalks, pedestrian cross-walks and -signals) detected by trained and validated artificial intelligence (computer vision) models in street-level imagery (e.g., Google Street View) into N-PHAM. Such micro-scale features correlate with walking and total PA, independent of macro-scale walkability features.  Exposure to particulate matter will be estimated and used to evaluate its impact on neighborhood-level PA participation and duration and BMI and to aid in new PEF siting decisions. The Phase 1 prototype called PED-PHAM (PEDestrian Public Health Assessment Model) will allow users to select neighborhoods and receive estimated health-related outcomes based on the locations PEFs and other environmental inputs. The prototype will leverage the existing nationwide block group N-PHAM geographic information system linking demographic and environmental data. Innovations. Create a prototype PED-PHAM software integrating validated artificial intelligence (computer vision) derived PEFs and air pollution exposure into a validated framework and tool that predicts place-based health impacts (e.g., PA and BMI). Aim 1: Detect Pedestrian Environment Factors with Acceptable Performance. We will train and validate computer vision models to infer eight PEFs (e.g., sidewalks, curb cuts, crosswalks) from digital street-level images. Further, the models will identify and locate (i.e., lat./long.) PEFs for 95% of 2173 participant buffers across four cities. Success Criteria: Models will detect PEFs with >85% precision, recall and accuracy comparative to human raters of the same features in =10,000 validation images per city. We will successfully infer PEFs for 2173 diverse neighborhoods across Baltimore, Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle, where participants from two NIH-funded studies [R01HL117884, R01CA198915] reside.Aim 2: Assess Pollution Exposure Metrics. Use existing transport-related air pollution modeling software (e.g., R-Line ) to estimate place-based near-road pollution exposure levels. Success Criteria: Average exposure metrics created for all participant neighborhood buffers and PEF point locations.Aim 3: Integrate PEFs and pollution exposure into the existing N-PHAM web-application to test the prototype PED-PHAM. Refine statistical models by adding PEFs and pollution exposure to estimate and monetize health outcomes. Success Criteria: PED-PHAM will have significantly more explanatory power than N-PHAM for PA and BMI after incorporating PEFs and pollution exposure and adjusting for demographics, walkability, greenspace, and transportation access in neighborhoods for the four cities. Phase 2 Goals: To scale PED-PHAM for national commercialization using geographically and demographically diverse national data to create optimized, place-based prescriptions of community design changes to reduce adverse exposures, increase community PA, and decrease chronic disease for user selected locations in the U.S.",

FP00032800,750,,,,,1,,,"This project aims to build a human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system (CPS) that can be used to provide adaptive automated interventions. The pilot application of the project, which is the focus on the validation approach, is personalized behavioral medicine. In such a system, the state of human behavior is assessed, continuously, using sensor data collected with wearable sensors and mobile devices. The system closes the loop by providing behavioral treatments based on the current state of the user. To build such a cyber-physical system, the project will develop a machine learning approach to model human behavior. However, designing a supervised machine learning model requires acquiring ground truth labels about a persons behavior. Gathering ground truth data in uncontrolled environments is not straightforward because users can introduce various types of noise into the machine learning systems by incorrectly expressing or articulating their behavior. To tackle this challenge, we propose a human-in-the-loop approach for data gathering and machine learning model training. The core computational approaches that this project focuses on include mindful active learning and complex behavior inference. The major goals of the project include (1) mindful active learning: we design active learning strategies that take constraints of the user such as query budget, informativeness of sensor data, and human memory into consideration when deciding what sensor data to query. To this end, the project will design both real-time active learning and offline active learning algorithms; (2) complex behavior inference: the project develops a vocabulary of complex events by analyzing user-expressed structured and unstructured input and uses this knowledge along with the sensor data to construct graph-based learning algorithms for behavior inference; (3) validation: the algorithms and techniques are validated through publicly available data as well as a user study that involves data collection with mobile devices in uncontrolled settings.",

A vast amount of research is conducted to use cycle exercise as therapy and showed efficacy of bike-based exercise [31-35] for neuro rehabilitation [36-40]. With advancement of computing and communication capabilities in recent years, telehealth has also emerged as a viable option to deliver care and treatment to patients. Randomized controlled trials have shown the capabilities of telehealth services [41-45]. However, there is scarcity of evidence showing telehealth equipped commercially viable products for neurorehabilitation and physical therapy ending up at patients' doorsteps.The specific aims:AIM1: Integration of an advanced bike control system and telehealth services in Theracycle+In this aim, we propose to develop a smart exercise bike with advanced functionalities. The development is divided into three milestones: Milestone 1.1: Interactive patient-centered user interface will be developed and integrated into Theracycle+ for users to navigate and visualize the controls and exercise analytics with ease. Milestone 1.2: Smart analytics software tool will be designed to collect the user exercise data from bikes and derive analytics. Milestone 1.3: A telehealth module will be designed to link patients with the care team for monitoring adherence and exercise progress.AIM2: Conducting an in-home, comparative, cross-over feasibility study on 10 PwPDsWe aim to conduct an in-home feasibility study on 10 PwPDs: Milestone 2.1: First, we will deploy both Theracycle (existing model) and Theracycle+ (modified model) in homes of PwPD who will be trained to use the bikes. Milestone 2.2: We will conduct an in-home cross-over study on 10 PwPDs to understand the feasibility and  reliability of Theracycle+. Milestone 2.3: We will pursue a comprehensive statistical analysis of the study data to measure the performance and clinical value of Theracycle+ to generate preliminary estimate of the effect size for better designing and implementing the next efficacy study in multi-center randomized controlled trials.Outcome Measures: We will evaluate adherence, behavioral changes, motivation, fine and gross motor functions, balance and gait measures and system performance at each stage of the study.The expected product will offer a unique stationary therapy bike designed specifically for those with neurological or mobility conditions. Theracycle+ will provide motorized- assisted therapy proven to reduce symptoms and improve mobility and motor skills in PwPD. In comparison to the existing products in the market that come with basic functions, Theracycle+ has competitive advantages: 1) patient-friendly interface suitable for patients with motor impairments, 2) on-board telehealth services that can deliver the analytics on adherence and therapy outcomes to the patient and care team, 3) longitudinal data analytics to make diagnostic decision on the progression of Parkinsons disease.",
FP00033093,756,,,,,1,,,"The aim of this proposal is to explore systems-level solutions to untreated hearing loss in adult Arizonans with limited income. Our project addresses access to health care and social cohesion by exploring solutions to three systems-level problems affecting hearing health care. Negative impact of existing system:  In Arizona, over 1.2 million adults have hearing loss, and 200,000 of them lack access to hearing health services due to limited income.1 Often untreated, hearing loss in adults is associated with isolation, depression, dementia, and falls.2 Hearing loss disrupts the ability to communicate with family, community members, and health care providers.  This results in diminished social relationships and decreased access to health care. Adults with untreated hearing loss experience higher risk of social isolation and hospitalization, and increased health care costs.3 In the United States, the cost to society of untreated hearing loss is estimated to be in the billions of dollars annually.4 The standard of care for comprehensive hearing health services includes hearing testing, hearing aid fitting, and aural rehabilitation (education and training in the use of hearing aids and communication strategies, critical to successful hearing outcomes).5 These services cost at least $2000,6 and are not accessible for Arizonans with limited income. Three systems-level issues contribute to this problem: 1) Medicare, Medicaid, and other third party payers do not reimburse for hearing aids and aural rehabilitation for most Arizonans with limited income;6 2) many hearing health providers do not include aural rehabilitation as part of their services;7 3) many older adults with hearing loss do not seek hearing aids and aural rehabilitation, even when they are available.8 There is an urgent need for systems change that will mitigate these problems.Positive effects of systems change: Studies in hearing health show that, for adults with hearing loss, use of hearing aids and participation in aural rehabilitation strengthens communication skills, expands social connections, improves cognitive function, and reduces falls.9,10 These benefits, in turn, boost access to health care by improving doctor-patient communication11 and strengthen social cohesion by enhancing family and community connections.12 The first step toward achieving hearing health equity for Arizonans with limited income is to explore solutions at the individual, community, and professional levels (problems #2 and #3 above). In acknowledgment that policy change is complex and takes time, exploration of solutions to problem #1 will be guided by data obtained from efforts at the individual, community and professional levels.  To address inconsistent provision of aural rehabilitation services, we will a) interview clinical education programs to identify the need for training and preparation in aural rehabilitation, and b) collaborate with hearing clinics across the state to develop strategies for including aural rehabilitation in their services. To address low participation in aural rehabilitation by patients, we will interview community stakeholders (older adults with hearing loss and their family members) to a) identify barriers to participation and b) explore innovative ways to facilitate hearing aid use. To address the lack of coverage for hearing aids and aural rehabilitation, we will team with our community partner (described below) to form a statewide coalition of stakeholders, organizations and researchers focused on collection of data to advocate for policy change. Throughout this process, we will be guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) dissemination and implementation (D&I) framework,13 the current hearing health evidence, our hearing health care delivery experience, our community partner, and our university collaborators. We will organize, evaluate, and synthesize interview responses using the rapid qualitative analysis process,14 a systematic, action-oriented approach to developing an initial understanding of our stakeholders perspectives and needs surrounding the three systems-level problems.",
FP00033097,757,,,,,1,,,"Evidence shows that mentoring and networking are critical to the success of prefaculty mentees, particularly at diverse institutions like the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM HSC), where underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities (URM) constitute the majority of prefaculty mentees. UNM HSC has a three-step faculty mentor development program (FMDP) that teaches mentoring and networking skills to senior faculty to advance the careers of junior faculty. The Program uses an online asynchronous mentor development coursework (Step I), synchronous mentor development workshops (Step II), and inter-institutional Mentoring Networks teleECHO program (Step III). Our preliminary data demonstrate that training research faculty mentors can improve their skills in this area. Consequently, our FMDP is now used in institutions of higher learning in eight Western States. While our FMDP trains senior faculty to meet the mentoring and networking needs of junior faculty, there is a need for a customized program that trains faculty to meet the unique mentoring and networking needs of prefaculty scientists, such as T32 scholars. There is an urgent need to correct this critical gap in mentor interventions to prevent the attrition of prefaculty scientists at diverse academic health centers. Our long-term goal is to advance the research careers of the prefaculty workforce to meet the nation's biomedical research needs. Our objective is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theoretically grounded mentor development program that helps advance the careers of prefaculty scientists. Our central hypothesis is that mentor training will enhance faculty mentors' skills in mentoring and networking to help advance the careers of prefaculty scientists. The rationale for our project is based upon the literature that conveys that mentors currently feel unprepared and unsupported to meet the needs of prefaculty mentees. We will accomplish our objective by completing the following Specific Aim: To develop, implement, and evaluate a customized three-step faculty mentor development program to train faculty mentors to meet the mentoring and networking needs of prefaculty mentees. It is anticipated that the completion of this Aim will establish the feasibility and effectiveness of the innovative, customized training program at a minority-serving institution in the Southwest, which will be generalizable to the other Western States. The outcome is expected to have a positive impact because evidence-based activities would replace currently used trial-and-error approaches in this field. Our study findings could help the NIGMS provide leadership in training the next generation of scientists, enhancing the diversity of the scientific workforce, and developing research capacities throughout the country.",
FP00033130,758,,,,,1,,,"Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) in the U.S. is at epidemic levels and has had a disproportionate impact in the state of Arizona. This current crisis has touched every neighborhood and sector, causing a near doubling in opioid-related deaths between 2016 and 2017 and a rise in HIV due to needle sharing. It is estimated that over 10,000 Arizonans have died of an opioid overdose in the last four years, with an additional 78,343 suspected opioid overdoses. As the epidemic of opioid and stimulant use in the United States continues to increase, more people living with SUD are encountering the criminal justice system. Incarcerated individuals experience unique risks; they are 40 times more likely to die of an opioid overdose in the first two weeks upon release than non-incarcerated individuals. Target Population: The target population for this project includes criminal justice-involved individuals who use drugs in three Northern Arizona counties: Coconino, Yavapai, and Mohave. The proposed project aims to provide a total of 225 individuals with services: 50 in Year 1, 75 in Year 2, and 100 in Year 3. Strategies: The opioid and overdose crisis has led to collaborations, evidence based policy, and increased accountability, but the most vulnerable populations are still being left behind. There is an urgent need for new approaches to drug use prevention and treatment that addresses the needs of people who use drugs and strategies that successfully engage traditionally hard-to-reach populations. Less than 20% of people who need treatment received any substance use treatment within the last year, while 95% of individuals with SUD who are not currently engaging in treatment do not feel they have a need for treatment. The reticence by people who use drugs to seek treatment indicates the importance of creating new approaches that reduce the harmful impacts of substance use. Understanding that until a person is ready for treatment, they are at risk for death, disease, and high costs to public systems, it is imperative that a harm reduction approach be taken to improve health outcomes, while increasing the chances of future success in treatment. Project Goals and Objectives: The aim of this project is to implement targeted harm reduction strategies and peer support services to criminal justice-involved individuals with a history of illicit substance use in Northern Arizona. There are five major goals that will be accomplished: 1) identify individuals with a history of criminal justice involvement who are at greatest risk for overdose, 2) screen and assess clients for the presence of SUD and co-occurring disorders, 3) provide recovery support services using a harm reduction model, 4) refer high-risk individuals to service providers in the community for additional treatment, and 5) prioritize services for underserved populations, particularly racial/ethnic minorities and rural-dwelling individuals.",

The Family Check-Up is an evidence-based parenting program that employs a data-driven, tailored, home visitation approach to address childrens behavioral health through the development of parenting skills and connection with community resources. Based on empirical effects on physical health, we have adapted the program, now called the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), to promote positive health routines related to nutrition, physical activity, sleep hygiene, and screen time, and connect families with preventative healthcare and other supports in the community. Within the FCU4Health, families complete a comprehensive assessment that will guide services. FCU4Health coordinators conduct a feedback session where they will present the results of the assessment and develop a service plan in collaboration with the families using motivational interviewing. The plan will include information about health and development, parent skill building, and connections with community resources, depending on parent needs and interests. Families are recontacted annually, to reassess needs and provide tailored services.Dr. Berkel will oversee the proposed work, where we will continue working with our established partnership between FTF, Avondale preschool, Family Resource Center, and Bayless integrated healthcare. The program is in the midst of the Year 2 follow-up stage and expect to begin the Year 3 follow-up this summer. New families with children aged 2 through 5 years can still enter the program by accessing care at Bayless.

FP00033160,760,,,,,1,,,"Project: Digital Storytelling to Reduce Vaccine Hesitancy among Parents of COVID-19 Vaccine-Eligible Children: A Pilot Randomized Controlled TrialPurpose of this Project: Among children and adolescents, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) can lead to health complications (e.g., multisystem inflammatory syndrome, long COVID), hospitalizations, and death.  COVID-19 vaccines are currently available to children over age 5, and they are powerful tools against this catastrophic pandemic. However, by April 2022, only 27.8% of children ages 5-11 and 58.5% of 12-17-year-olds were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Many parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 due to vaccine hesitancy, the refusal or delayed acceptance of an accessible vaccine.Narratives are powerful tools that can be used for health promotion interventions. They are best used to persuade individuals to enact health behaviors (such as vaccination) that require an immediate personal cost (e.g., discomfort) for a longer-term gain (e.g., disease immunity). Our study will examine the use of digital storytelling (DST), a specific form of narrative developed via community engagement that shows promise as an effective intervention to promote health behaviors. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), we will gather narratives from parents and legal guardians who were formerly hesitant to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 and ask them to share their stories of transformation to becoming COVID-19 vaccine-acceptant. Story viewers will emotionally engage and identify with the DST characters and stories. This emotional engagement and identification will impact viewers' attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control to vaccinate their children. These changes will reduce parents and legal guardians COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and bolster their intentions and behavior to immunize their children against COVID-19.Objectives for this Study:Objective 1: Develop digital stories (each 2-3 minutes long) with a diverse sample of parents and legal guardians who transformed from being COVID-19 vaccine-hesitant to vaccine-accepting.  Objective 2: Assess feasibility and acceptability of a web-based pilot DST intervention vs. an information-only control among parents and legal guardians (n=80) of children who are not vaccinated against COVID-19Where the work will take place:This work will take place online.Dr. Koskans specific roles: PI Koskan is an essential component of this proposal given her work in community-engaged research, qualitative research methods, vaccine acceptability (including COVID-19 vaccines), and hesitancy. Dr. Koskan will be responsible for submitting progress reports to the NIH. She will also register the study with ClinicalTrials.gov before initiating the study. She will work with the team to discuss the status of randomizing individuals into the intervention and control groups, identify and train students for the project, data collection and analysis, administrative responsibilities, and any potential intervention concerns. PI Koskan will share results with other study team members and key personnel. If any intervention adaptations are needed, she will first discuss the potential changes in the study and promptly update the study protocol with the IRB. Dr. Koskan will serve as the contact PI with Merck and will take the lead in preparing required reports.

To provide efficient and effective vaccination outreach to P/L refugee women, precision population health strategies applied through a racial equity lens are crucial. This community-engaged population health research incorporates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to identify patterns in pregnant and lactating refugee womens COVID-19 vaccine-related behaviors. It contextualizes the AI findings with in-depth interviews with pregnant and recently pregnant refugee women and through iterative community stakeholder engagement.  Together, we will combine these mixed methodologies to yield precision population health strategies to aid in the prevention of COVID-19 among pregnant and lactating refugee women. The research will also demonstrate the power of the integrative multidisciplinary approach to precision population health, which will open a new direction in this field. This approach can be used by other healthcare systems to create precision population health strategies.Objectives for this Study:Objective 1:  Discover risk factors of vaccination inequities and perform risk stratification via AI data mining. We will analyze longitudinal health, syndemic and vaccination data, and SDoH of ~6,000 P/L female patients including ~900 refugees. Using machine-learning methods, we will model the relationships between vaccine uptake and COVID-19 syndemics conditional on both refugee and P/L status. Using these models, we will discover risk factors for vaccine hesitancy and predict outcomes of potential interventions. We will cluster patients into subgroups, estimate individual-level and subgroup-level risks, and identify PDs in each subgroup. Objective 2: Discover barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination via semi-structured interviews. We will sample PD refugee women (identified in Objective 1) who were either vaccinated during pregnancy (n=15) or while lactating (n=15), and vaccine-hesitant P/L refugee women (n=15) receiving care in one healthcare system. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with these women to elucidate their concerns about COVID-19 vaccination and factors influencing their decision-making to become vaccinated. Objective 3: Work with community stakeholders to iteratively triangulate discoveries from AI models with qualitative data to contextualize the findings and inform strategies to decrease P/L refugee women's vaccine hesitancy.",

FP00033266,763,,,,,1,,,"Abstract  Component A Annual influenza vaccination is the primary prevention strategy for infection and severe disease. A constantly evolving influenza virus through antigenic drift dictates that vaccines are re-evaluated every year. COVID-19 has overlapping symptoms with influenza and has significantly complicated the healthcare burden associated with viral infections, morbidity, and mortality. While COVID-19 vaccines received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), additional COVID-19 vaccines are under development due to emerging variants, some of which are known to evade currently authorized vaccines. As such, boosters are recommended to thwart spikes and new waves of variant infections which complicates assessment of the effectiveness of both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza vaccines simultaneously. Phoenix, Arizona is the fifth largest and fastest growing city in the nation, and, importantly, is home to an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population. Twice during the COVID-19 pandemic, Arizona was #1 worldwide in per capita COVID-19 cases. Arizona has seen a mixed adoption of vaccine use for both COVID-19 and influenza, allowing for excellent local comparisons. In this project, leveraging Arizona State Universitys (ASU) core capabilities, we propose to study vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a diverse demographic and clinical population (including immunocompromised HIV patients) seen at outpatient clinics managed by ValleyWise Community Hospital, Phoenix Childrens Hospital and ASU Student Health Services. Given identified health disparities in infection and vaccination, we propose to examine social determinants of health to identify the most vulnerable groups. We will collect specimens (nasopharyngeal and/or anterior nasal swabs) and relevant demographic and clinical data from laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza and COVID-19 in children and adults with acute respiratory infection, seeking care in ambulatory clinics, to calculate vaccine effectiveness for both influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. We will also sequence viral genomes to identify subtype/variants using our deep expertise and incomparable resources in next-generation sequencing and viral genomic bioinformatics. We will use this genomic sequencing data to further investigate VE analyses and understand virus evolution. Importantly, to examine health disparities in vaccination and vaccine effectiveness, we will implement longitudinal surveys and geographical information systems mapping to measure and model social determinants of health. Overall, our multidisciplinary program provides a comprehensive approach to study VE and to understand social determinates that drives health disparities. We believe the findings will have important, long lasting policy implications towards vaccination and examination of VE.  Abstract  Component D Immunization is a cornerstone of public health policy and is demonstrably highly cost-effective when used to protect child health. Vaccines have transformed public health, particularly since national programs for immunization first became properly established and coordinated in the 1960s. In countries with high vaccine program coverage, many of the diseases that were previously responsible for many childhood deaths have essentially disappeared. Vaccines exploit the extraordinary ability of the highly evolved human immune system to respond to, and remember, encounters with pathogen antigens. Annual flu shots are one of our most effective defenses against the flu. One class of influenza vaccines works by exposing the body to small amounts of inactivated virus that has been killed by a formaldehyde. This vaccine typically contains a mix of four different viruses, including influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and two influenza B viruses. Antibody protection is thought to persist for about 6 months. This waning immunity, along with genetic mutations in circulating influenza viruses, is why we get a new vaccine each year. Most COVID-19 vaccines are designed to elicit immune responses, ideally neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The adaptive immune response is a major determinant of the clinical outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection and underpins vaccine efficacy. T cell responses develop early and correlate with protection but are relatively impaired in severe disease and are associated with intense activation and lymphopenia. While there is general agreement that influenza virus vaccines provide some protection against infection, the impact that repeated annual influenza virus vaccination has on the level of protection is still not fully understood. The impact of repeated vaccination on vaccine effectiveness (VE) is uncertain. We therefore study the implications on the monitoring of antibody levels, cell mediated immunological responses and timing of revaccination in these patients. We propose to collect serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), before and after immunization/booster, from different priority groups such as children, elderly (>65 yrs.), immunocompromised (HIV) and healthy adults. These samples will be shared with other participating institutions for future analysis. ",

FP00033329,765,,,,,1,,,"Precision prevention is the next frontier for ameliorating the burden of mental health problems. Up to  of preschoolers have diagnosed internalizing/externalizing psychopathology. Thus,  to intervene before problems become entrenched, prevention must start during the vulnerability phase in toddlerhood.  Evidence-based risk identification and intervention (EBIs) tools exist for this age group but the absence of a systematic implementation framework for preemptive prevention impedes population reach. Pediatric primary care is an optimal service context for implementation as a trusted context emphasizing mental health surveillance in routine care. Yet the potential reach and population impact for large scale implementation of mental health risk identification and prevention in primary care has not been realized due to substantial contextual and structural barriers. These include lack of pediatric learning health systems-based clinical decision supports that address developmentally-based decisional uncertainty for this age, dearth of accessible interventions, and  lack of engagement strategies and value propositions informed by diverse stakeholders views about mental health identification/prevention in young children. The lack of evidence based guidance/resources integrated within pediatric learning health systems is perniciously contributes to early life mental health disparities, as lack of clear guidance amplifies implicit bias under conditions of uncertainty.",
FP00033345,766,,,,,1,,,"Care engagement and viral suppression for People Living with HIV (PLWH) is a public health imperative given the potential for improving survival prospects, reducing transmission risk, and helping end the HIV epidemic. Due to systemic racism and healthcare inequities, African Americans (AA) living with HIV are consistently less engaged in HIV care which leads to lower rates of viral suppression compared to their racial counterparts. Additionally, older (= 50 years of age) AA people living with HIV (OAAPLWH), a population often overlooked, are less likely to be engaged in care and virally suppressed compared to their older racial counterparts; in some areas, like Ohio, they have rates similar to the younger age groups. Although OAAPLWH are less likely to be engaged in HIV care and virally suppressed, factors that impact these outcomes have received little attention. OAAPLWH face many challenges to engagement, and these challenges may be due to multiple stigmatized identities (e.g., HIV, age, race, gender, and sexual orientation). These stigmatized identities may intersect or converge, a concept known as intersectional stigma, to shape OAAPLWHs experiences, which in turn severely impacts engagement. Research on intersectional stigma among OAAPLWH is scarce. Most studies have been cross-sectional, qualitative, and/or only focused on specific subgroups. In addition, the research is lacking on addressing the longitudinal effects and the mechanisms through which intersectional stigma impacts engagement and suppression among OAAPLWH. Mechanisms like housing stability, food insecurity, coping, and substance use. The purpose of this study is to characterize the longitudinal impact of intersectional stigma on HIV care outcomes among OAAPLWH. We will conduct a longitudinal sequential, explanatory mixed methods study. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) examine the longitudinal effects of intersectional stigma on HIV care outcomes (i.e., retention in care, medication adherence, and viral suppression), 2) identify the pathways through which intersectional stigma affects HIV care outcomes, and 3) examine the factors like social support, resilience, and the patient-provider relationship that buffer the effects of intersectional stigma on HIV care outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that among OAAPLWH, severity of experiences of intersectional stigma will be inversely related to retention in care, medication adherence, and viral suppression. This mixed-methods study will involve surveys (N = 600) conducted at baseline, 6- , 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-up, an in-depth interview (n = 40) conducted at the 12-month follow-up, and photo elicitation interviews (n = 40) conducted at the 18-month follow-up.

Boardman, M.D., Mayo Clinic Rochester (Co-I)  Yunro Chung, Ph.D., Biodesign Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Arizona State University (Co-I)  Ji Qiu, Ph.D., Biodesign Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Arizona State University (Co-I)  Abstract  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 4th most diagnosed cancer and the 2nd highest cause of cancer death in the United States. Although CRC linked to a family history represents only a fraction of all CRC cases, understanding them provides  clues  to  the  underlying  drivers  for  all  types  of  CRC,  and  will  greatly  contribute  to  our  mission  of prevention, early detection, and improved survival. Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common genetic cause of CRC and accounts for up to 1 in 10 cases of CRC. Individuals with LS are more likely to develop cancers, especially CRC, with a lifetime risk of 80%, typically presenting at younger ages. People with LS inherit one or more mutations in the genes that are responsible for repairing errors in DNA. A defective cellular machinery to repair errors in the genome leads to mutations that increase the incidence of CRC in LS subjects. We hypothesize that the accumulated  mutations will contribute to the unique etiopathology and clinical behavior of these cancers  and  understanding  them  will  benefit  the  early  detection  and  treatment  of  LS-associated  CRC (LSaCRC). We are proposing a proteome-scale, comprehensive study of the humoral immune response against INDIVIDUAL human, viral and bacterial proteins to identify LSaCRC specific antibody biomarkers.  Protein microarrays provide a multiplexed, high-throughput platform to profile host antibody immune responses against thousands of proteins in parallel. We will employ human and microbial protein arrays to study tumor associated autoantibodies  (TAAb),  and,  in  recognition  of  the  growing  appreciation  of  the  role  gut  microbes  in  CRC development, anti-microbial antibodies (AMAb) to exploit the potential utility of an LSaCRC specific antibody signature for its diagnosis. In addition, we will perform explorative comparative multi-omics analysis of tumor genome, gene expression, and microbiome to understand the underlying mechanisms of antibody response in LSaCRC. Our proposed study has the potential to change the landscape of cancer screening in LS individuals. Our project will leverage close collaboration between cancer biologists, proteomics experts, genomicists, and gastroenterology clinicians at Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University. Promising markers identified in this pilot will help apply for the extramural support for a prospective cross-sectional study in LS patients to assess the association of  candidate markers with early detection of CRC in conjunction with surveillance colonoscopy. Clinical infrastructure and resources at Mayo Clinic will not only support our proposed study, but also position us optimally to pursue subsequent clinical validation of our findings.  Human subject statement  Our study is not a human subject study. All samples have already been collected and biobanked at the Mayo clinic. Deidentified samples will used for the proposed study. No patients personal information will be made available to researchers involved in this study.  Budget allocation $60K will be allocated to ASU for antibody profiling. $20K will be made available to Mayo clinic for next generation sequencing.  A.  Hypotheses and Specific Aims Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the US (1). Most CRC is sporadic and not associated with a family history; however, about 10-20% of CRC occurs in people with hereditary conditions (2). Among them, Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary cause of CRC (3). LS is characterized by a germ-line mutation of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. MMR is important in maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA replication mistakes. Deficient MMR leads to the accumulation of mutations, and, eventually, uncontrolled cell growth.  Therefore, LS associated CRC (LSaCRC) usually carries a high tumor mutation burden (4). Mutated proteins are one major category of tumor antigens that can trigger a host immune response  (5).  Early  in  cancer  development,  the  amount  of  tumor  antigens  produced  and  released  into  the circulation are often too low for robust detection; however, the antibody response to tumor antigens serves as a signal amplifier with the production of tumor associated autoantibodies (TAAb) being released into the circulation readily detectable by immunoassays (6). Furthermore, cancer development results from the interaction of genetics and environmental factors. Among the environmental factors, the role of the microbiome in cancer development is  increasingly  described  (7).  This  is  especially  true  for  CRC  because  it  occurs  in  a  tissue  with  the  highest microbial  population  in  the  body  (8).  Microbial  infection  can  elicit  anti-microbial  antibodies  (AMAb). Differences in cancer biology between LSaCRC and sporadic CRC (sCRC) suggests the potentially different roles of microorganisms in their etiology and the different immunological interaction with the host during infection. Our hypothesis is that LSaCRC will have a specific AAb and AMAb signature compared with cancer free LS individuals and non-LS sCRC patients that can be utilized for its detection. Our specific aims are formed to test this hypothesis (Fig. 1).   Aim 1. Identify a specific antibody signature in patients with LS associated CRC In this aim, we will compare TAAb and AMAb profiles between LSaCRC and cancer free LS and sCRC and identify an antibody signature for LSaCRC.  Sporadic CRCCancer-free LSHuman and microbial supporting Aim 1: An antibody panel including both autoantibodies and anti-microbial antibodies  that can identify CRC wit high sensitivity in individuals with LS  Aim 2. Explore a multi-omics approach to understand antibody response in LSaCRC Our  research  will  focus  on  the  unique  antibody  profiles  in  CRC  with  LS.  In  addition,  to  understand  the association between antibody response and the underlying tumor biology and tumor microenvironment, we will perform an exploratory multiomics analysis of genomes / neoantigenomes, transcriptomes, metagenomes, and antibody-omes  in  a  selected set  of  CRC  patients  with  LS who have a high score of the antibody signature  and  5 sporadic  CRC  patients  who lack  the  signature.  This  aim will  be  exploratory  with  the goal  to  establish  a  technical pipeline future research.  B.  Significance Because individuals with LS are at a higher risk of developing cancers at a younger age, they undergo endoscopic and imaging-based screening starting at a young age and more frequently compared to the general population. This is highlighted by the current recommendation to initiate CRC screening with colonoscopy at age 25 and repeating at intervals of 1-2 years (9).  Although colonoscopy is effective in detecting CRC early and likely preventing mortality, annual or biannual colonoscopy is costly, cumbersome to the patients and associated with a risk of morbidity from procedural complications. The screening compliance remains low due to these barriers.  Even for individuals who follow the screening guidance, interval cancer may develop in between screenings. The development of a noninvasive blood test specifically for LSaCRC will improve compliance with screening, reduce the burdens of an invasive annual procedure and overall lead to early cancer detection and improved survival in this high-risk population (Fig. 2). Our study represents the first step of a noninvasive screening method that in conjunction with colonoscopy can identify CRC early in LS subjects and their relatives. Besides CRC, risks for many other cancers are also increased significantly in LS individuals, including endometrial, ovarian, stomach, and  others.  However,  unlike  CRC,  there  are  no  consensus-proven  screening  methods  for  these  extra-colonic cancers (10, 11).  Their diagnosis is often symptom based and usually too late with undesirable prognosis. A Aim 2. Genomic (mutational), transcriptome, metagenome analysis for a mechanistic understanding of specific antibody response in CRC with LS. Fig. 1. Specific aims. Red dots represent LSaCRC specific antibodies. LS associated proteome arrays CRC blood-based diagnostic could work for these individuals. We will include a small number of  extra-colonic  cancers  with  LS  (Table  1). Our study will shed light on the possibility of a  pan-cancer  antibody  signature  for  LS associated cancers.  Frequent colonoscopycolonoscopyPositive Ab test Antibody assayNormalColorectal cancer Negative Ab test Fig.2. Intended clinical use of LS associated CRC biomarkers. Cancer  is  a  complex  heterogenous genetic disease. Many environmental factors play  a  role  in  different  stages  of  cancer development. However, it is extremely challenging to decipher the contribution of each factor because sporadic CRC is extremely heterogenous and it usually takes 10-20 years for it to develop (12). The study of cancers with a  hereditary  cause  has  contributed  greatly  to  cancer  research  because  of  its  homogeneous  defined  genetic background  as  the  initiating  event  and  faster  development  time.    We  still  have  limited  understanding  of carcinogenesis in LS subjects. The microorganisms that play a role in the initiation and progression CRC with LS and sporadic CRC can be different because of the unique genetics of CRC with LS. The defects in MMR and the high mutational burden associated with LSaCRC may require a different set of microorganisms in its initiation, promotion,  and  progression.  Our  multi-omics  approach  can  also  shed  light  on  its  potential  of  exploiting  the underlying mechanisms of cancer development in LS and improve our understanding of the interaction between our immune system, gut microbiome, and cancer cells (13).  C.  Methods (including clear and specific contributions by each investigator) We  have  assembled  a  team  of  experts  including  physician  scientists,  basic  and  translational  researchers.  Dr. LaBaer (ASU PI) is a medical oncologist and pioneer in disease proteomics, the developer of the NAPPA platform and an expert in disease biomarkers. Dr. Jewel Samadder (Mayo PI) is a physician scientist with a focus on precision medicine in GI cancers (14-22). Dr. Lisa Boardman is a gastroenterologist and leads the GI biobank at Mayo clinic. Dr. Michael Barrett is an expert on cancer genomics. Dr. Yunro Chung is a biostatistician to ensure the power of our study and the proper statistical analysis of the experimental data. Antibody profiling will be performed  at  ASU  and  NGS  analysis  will  be  performed  mainly  at  Mayo.  The  team  will  work  together  on experimental design, data analysis, manuscript preparation and proposal writing.  C.1. Patients and samples All serum samples used in this study will be obtained from the Mayo GI biobank  including  3  comparison  groups  (Table  1)  with  well-documented clinical and genetic diagnosis information.  For a subset of patients, besides serum samples, there are also available tissues including histopathological tumor blocks and slides, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells to support omics analysis.  C.2. Technology C.2.1.  High Programmable Protein Array (HD-NAPPA) Protein  microarrays  offer  a  high-throughput platform  to  display  thousands  of  human  or microbial  antigens  to  screen  for  immune responses  simultaneously  (23,  24).   The responses  are  rapidly  identified  because  the address of each protein is known in advance; all proteins,  even  rare  ones,  are  represented equally,  arrayed  on  a  single  microscope  slide and requiring only a few microliters of plasma per  assay.    We  will  use  high  density  Nucleic Acid  Programmable  Protein  Arrays  (HD-NAPPA,  Fig  3) to  study  anti-microbial antibodies and autoantibodies (25-27). Proteins are freshly produced using in vitro expression  Fig. 3. HD-NAPPA. (A) Antibody profiling on HD-NAPPA.

Note  the obvious  differences  in  the  overall  reactivity between TAAb and AMAb profiles. lysates from spotted plasmid DNA, thus circumventing the need for the expression and purification of tens of thousands of proteins as required by the conventional protein spotting protein arrays. NAPPA is flexible and can display any proteins with known gene sequences. Our use of human cell lysates for protein expression encourages the proper folding for the detection of conformational antibodies (28). Intra- and inter-array correlation coefficients are generally > 0.95 for serological profiling on HD-NAPPA. Our proposed study on tens of thousands individual microbial and human proteins is empowered by the  innovation,  cost-effectiveness,  and  flexibility  of  HD-NAPPA. Because we work with full length proteins, we can study antibodies against  folded  proteins  beyond  simple  linear  epitopes,  with immediate identification of the target antigens. We note that proteins on the arrays may lack some native PTMs that might be important for  some  antibody-antigen  interactions.  Nevertheless,  unmodified recombinant proteins have been predominantly used successfully in ELISA for assessing infection status, as well as other diseases, such as the H. pylori, HBV and HCV serological tests. We believe that the proteins  expressed  in  our  system  will  be  recognized  by  many autoantibodies and anti-microbial antibodies developed in patients.  C.2.2. Next generation sequencing analysis We will use DNA content-based flow cytometry to purify nuclei of tumor  and  non-tumor  cells  from  solid  tissue  biopsies  of  interest including FFPE samples. The use of flow sorted samples provides high resolution of mutational and neoepitope landscapes including those arising in LS patients (29). Nuclei from each sample will be disaggregated and then filtered through a 40 m mesh prior to flow sorting  with  an  Aria  cytometer.  DNAs  from  each  sorted  tumor population and a patient matched control sample will be sequenced within the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility (MGF) using established protocols for whole exome analysis. Whole exon capture will be carried out with Agilents SureSelect Human All Exon 71 MB v6 kit.  Libraries will be loaded onto paired end flow cells and sequenced to a mean depth of 80X as 101 X 2 paired end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using TruSeq SBS sequencing kit version 3 and HiSeq data collection version 1.4.8 software. Base-calling will be performed using Illuminas RTA version 1.12.4.2. Reads from the BAM files will be mapped strip to the 1000 genomes version of GRCh38 using bwa-mem version 0.7.17 (30, 31). C.3. Relevant experience / preliminary data For years, we have successfully employed NAPPA for the identification of TAAb biomarkers, including the development  of  the  first  clinically  available  commercial  blood  test  for  breast  cancer  NAPPA  (32-38).  Our previous success, Videssa Breast, which is a CLIA-certified blood test for breast cancer used clinically with mammography includes a panel of our autoantibody markers. Our goal is to develop a test similar to Videssa Breast that can aid in the diagnosis of CRC in LS coupled with or without  colonoscopy.  To  determine  if  LSaCRC  and  sCRC  might have distinguishable TAAb, we have assayed the antibodies against 3500  human  proteins  and  2000  microbial  proteins  in  18  LSaCRC (Fig. 4). We compared antibody profiles between LSaCRC and sCRC (Fig. 5). We clearly observed unique reactivity patterns among 18 patients with LS associated CRC compared to those with sporadic CRC (Fig. 6).

Dot  plots differential  reactivity  between  LSaCRC  and sCRC.             resolution analyses including the identification of a MSH2 germ line variant that was converted to homozygosity in each tumor, the identification of tissue specific somatic lesions, and a unique profile of predicted neoepitopes. The latter was achieved using EpitopeHunter as previously described (46).  C.4. Aim 1. Identify an antibody signature in LSaCRC We will study TAAb against the human proteome comprising ~17,000 human proteins and AMAbs 13,000 microbial antigens covering ~70 bacteria and ~150 viruses in serum samples (Table 1).  We  will  use  gut  microorganisms  with  previously  reported  connection with CRC. For viruses, we will include all proteins they encode. For bacteria, it is not possible to include thousands of proteins encoded by each bacterium for a screening project. The literature points to bacterial outer membrane proteins as the most  likely  immunogens.  To  this  end,  we  will  focus  on  their membrane and secreted proteins (MSP) either as annotated in NCBI or predicated by pSORT2. In this way, we will achieve substantive coverage (around 5-10%) of their proteomes using the MSPs. We believe this will create a well-balanced set for this pioneer study.   Fig.  7.  Overlap  in  predicted  neoepitopes  across  4 tumors  in  LS  patient.  Venn  diagrams  of  predicted neoepitopes:  A)  HLA-A,  B)  HLA-B,  and  C)  HLA-C binding  single  nucleotide  variants (SNVs)  and frameshift variants  from  whole  exome  data  of  PTCC (renal  2008),  CRC  (2015),  TNBC  (2017),  and  CRC (2018). Human  and  microbial  protein  arrays  will  be  produced  as  previously  reported  (26).  Because  of  the importance of mucosal immunity in gut immunity, we will study both IgG and IgA antibodies. We will profile Abs against proteins displayed on arrays at 1:300 dilution, and the presence of Abs will be detected by anti-human IgG and IgA antibodies using fluorescence-based methods. Samples will be randomized to run on the arrays to avoid bias between case and control. To control for day-to-day operational variations, two equal-volume pools of samples of cancer and control will be prepared as two QC samples. On each screening day, the QC pool samples will be screened along with other samples. Inter-day correlations for the pooled samples must be greater than R > 0.90 for data from each screening day to be included for further data analysis. All arrays will be scanned using a TECAN scanner at the same settings and analyzed by the TECAN ArrayPro image analysis software using the same parameters to ensure comparability. Raw intensity data will be median normalized before analysis.  C.5. Aim 2. Explore a multi-omics approach to understand antibody response in LSaCRC  In  this  Aim,  we  will  perform  a  preliminary  analysis  of  the  relationship  between  antibody-omes  and  tumor genomes / transcriptomes / microbiomes. To keep the scope within the seed grant, this Aim will be observational to demonstrate technical capability and assess the association between: 1) the mutation and expression of tumor antigens in tumor tissues and the level of TAAb in the blood; 2) the microbiota in the tumor tissues and the AMAb in the blood. We will select 5 LSaCRC patients who have the highest antibody signature score as determined in Aim1 and 5 sCRC patients with low scores AND whose tissue and white blood samples are available. For each sample we will sort and collect tumor fractions for whole exome sequencing using our established methods (29). We will align tumor and germline data (in bam format) for each patient. We use VarScan2 (version 2.3.9) (47) available on high performance cluster computing environment to call tumor-specific variants including non-synonymous  somatic  mutations  and  indels.   We  will  pay  special  attention  to  variants  that  likely  disrupt protein function, identify mutations targeting known cancer driver genes (e.g. TP53, APC) and pathways, and filter out common polymorphisms reported in dbSNP and other population based studies. In addition, we will also prepare 16S rRNA gene library and the V2 to V4 region will be amplified and sequenced on illumine MiSeq sequencers.  For  RNA-seq,  Illumina  sequencing  libraries  will  be  made  using  transposon-based  integration  of barcoded sequencing adapters into double-stranded cDNA made using the RiboMinus Eukaryote Kit. Data processing  for  analyzing  human  transcripts  will  be  done  by  our  standard  pipeline  of  using  STAR(48)  and edgeR(49), and cell type deconvolution for assessing immune cell infiltration and stromal cell compositions will be done by CIBERSORTx (50). Besides demonstrating technical feasibility, we will perform comparative analysis and ask the following questions.  What  is  association  between  multiomics  profiles  and  AAb/AMAb  profiles?  Are  there  more  non-synonymous mutations in LSaCRC compared with non-LS sCRC? Are there specific gene expression signatures for  different  types  of  CRC?  We  will  perform  Gene  Set  Enrichment  Analysis  (GSEA)  for  upregulated  / downregulated genes and mutated genes in LSaCRC. What microorganisms or microbial genes are over- or under-represented in LS associated CRC? Are there differences in the contexture of tumor infiltrating immune cells between  different  CRC  types?  We  hope  this  explorative  analysis  will  guide  future  research  direction  to understand the development of CRC in LS patients. D.  Statistical Methods Our ultimate goal is to identify an antibody panel with a sensitivity to distinguish LS associated CRC from LS without cancer to be >= 95% at 40% specificity to aid in the diagnosis of LSaCRC. Our interest in markers with high sensitivity at moderate specificity is determined by their intended clinical application (Fig. 2). We want to capture all cancers with our blood test followed by colonoscopy to weed out false positives, if applicable. For the current study, the primary goal of our analysis is to discover the best antibody panel that distinguishes LSaCRC from LS without cancer to have the highest sensitivity at 40% specificity. Specifically, we will select candidate antibodies with sensitivities at 40% specificity greater than or equal to 60% and construct a panel using machine learning algorithms, such as regularized logistic regression or random forest models. The best panel will be chosen based on the highest cross-validated sensitivity at 40% specificity. False discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-values less than 0.05 will be classified as statistically significant. We will further choose the top 300 candidate antibodies having the smallest p-values and plan to validate them taking advantage of the multiplexity of the HD-NAPPA platform in the future. Assuming that 60 candidate biomarkers (0.2% of 30,000) are diagnostically useful with sensitivity at 40% specificity of greater than 84% and the others useless with sensitivity at 40% specificity of 60%, i.e. true positive and false positive fractions are the same as 60%, our study with a total of 205 samples (102 LS without cancer, 103 LS associated CRC) achieves at least 75% (or 82% power at FDR of 5% to detect the useful  biomarkers).  Similar  analysis  will  be  used  for  constructing  the  best  antibody  panel  that  distinguishes sporadic CRC from LS with or without cancer and selecting candidates for future validation. In addition, we will also  analyze  antibody  signatures  together  with  available  patients'  clinical  and  genetic  data  to  assess  if  their inclusion can further improve the classification performance of the antibody biomarkers.  We will also perform explorative comparative analysis between the antibody profiles between non-colonic cancer associated with LS and LS without cancer.  E.  Interpretation of Possible Study Results (both positive and negative) There  are  three  possible  outcomes  of  our  research.  1)  No  differences  of  antibody  profiles  between  LS  and LSaCRC  (<60%  sensitivity  at  40%  specificity).  This  is  very  unlikely  given  our  understanding  of  cancer immunology, the data we have seen in the literature for TAAbs in other cancers, and the difference we have observed between LSaCRC and sCRC; 2) Moderate differences (~60-90% sensitivity at 40% specificity). This shows the promise; however, we will need to find ways to improve the performance before validation. To this end, we will enrich the antigen content on our arrays in future studies.  For example, we may perform screening against  mutated  neoantigens  based  on  tumor  genomic/transcriptomic  analysis  and  microbial  antigens  using transcripts from metagenomics/meta-transcriptomics analysis tumor tissues. We may also expand our study to fungi antigens; 3) Great differences (>95% sensitivity at 40% specificity). This the best-case scenario. We will confirm and validate candidate antibodies in a large (longitudinal) sample set (see also section G). There are several additional ways to build on the initial success. We may also expand our search as described above to further  improve  marker  performance  and  robustness.  We  may  seek  collaboration  with  experts  on  other  LS associated cancers and identify markers that have broader applications.  F.  Data Milestones (0-3m) Sample identification and acquisition; (0-6m) Human proteome array production and TAAb profiling; (4-9m)  Microbial  protein  array  production  and  AMAb  profiling;  (7-12m)  Exome,  transcriptome,  microbiome sequencing; (10-12m) Manuscript and proposal preparation and submission. G.  Future Proposed Extramural Funding Source, Expected Budget, and Submission Date Our goal is to submit a research proposal at the NCI R01 level with an expected budget of 1.25M direct cost over 5 years in the fall of 2023. Dr. Samadder is leading several clinical trials in the hereditary cancer space including prospective  multi-center  trials  of  stool  DNA  for  detection  of  CRC  LS  and  tri-valent  vaccine  for  adenoma prevention in LS that may provide additional future opportunities for synergy using the above blood autoantibody approach for non-invasive CRC detection. The current study will expand the horizon by exploiting novel antibody biomarkers. Should our results be promising, with the strong interdisciplinary team we have assembled and the readily samples collected in the ongoing trials and the Mayo GI biobank, we will be able to submit a competitive proposal.

FP00033434,768,,,,,1,,,"Abstract/Project Summary  African American women experience a high burden of cardiometabolic disease conditions. Fifty-seven percent are obese, 57% have cardiovascular disease, and 12% have diagnosed diabetes. Engaging in regular aerobic physical activity is an established mechanism to prevent and manage these cardiometabolic diseases. The purpose of this study is test the efficacy of a culturally tailored, theory-based smartphone-delivered physical activity intervention to increase physical activity, promote adherence to national aerobic physical activity guidelines, and improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors among African American women. In a 12-month, two arm randomized trial, 240 sedentary (i.e., < 60 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity) African American women with obesity (i.e., BMI >30 kg/m2) will be assigned to receive either Smart Walk, a culturally tailored, Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity promotion intervention (n=120), or a Fitbit-only comparison arm (n=120). The Smart Walk intervention group will receive a culturally tailored physical activity intervention delivered via the Smart Walk smartphone app, virtual physical activity coaching, and text messages. Features available on the Smart Walk app include: 1) personal profile pages, 2) culturally relevant multi-media (i.e., text and video) physical activity promotion modules, 3) message/discussion boards, and 4) physical activity self-monitoring/tracking feature that integrates with Fitbit activity monitors for participants to track their daily, weekly, and monthly activity. Virtual physical activity coaches will actively engage and facilitate group-based dialogue among participants on the discussion boards and provide individualized, one-on-one physical activity coaching via telephone or commercially available app-based video teleconferencing software, based on participant preference. Smart Walk participants also receive three physical activity promotion text messages each week for the duration of the active 4-month intervention. The Fitbit-only arm comparison arm will receive a Fitbit activity monitor and be encouraged to use the commercially available device to increase physical activity. We hypothesize participants in the Smart Walk intervention group will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in physical activity and cardiometabolic risk factors when compared to the Fitbit-only comparison group. Primary outcomes include self-reported and accelerometer-measured changes in physical activity. Secondary outcomes include traditional risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (i.e., BMI, blood pressure, serum lipid profiles, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance) and more novel and prognostic risk factors, including cardiorespiratory fitness, aortic pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory biomarkers of TNF-, IL-6, and anti-inflammatory biomarkers of IL-10 and IL-15. We will also explore mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness and determine the total societal cost per participant of delivering the Smart Walk intervention and the cost-effectiveness of the two study groups to increase minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

FP00033462,770,,,,,1,,,"Overview Most U.S. cities are served by All-Hazards Fire Departments that respond to various medical, fire, and safety emergencies. Tasked with handling a wide variety of community hazards, the nature of the work that fire personnel do also presents a number of hazards to the health of fire personnel themselves. As outlined by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA, 2020) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of Emergency Medical Services (EMS.gov, 2020), the fire service anticipates a future in which new data-driven risk prediction and management (DDRPM) tools are harnessed to facilitate dramatic reductions of both community risk and risk to fire personnel by detecting and ameliorating risks in advance. Yet, designing DDRPM tools to realize this vision requires deep understanding of current work practices, and the potential future impacts of such tools on labor (e.g., increased data work), workers (e.g., increased data work), and communities (e.g., intensified surveillance of marginalized populations). The intersection of sociotechnical work practices for handling risks and design of data-driven computational tools make this an ideal site of human-centered computing research for this critical social and technical infrastructure. There is an urgent need to research and design human-centered, ethically-rigorous DDRPM tools for the U.S. fire service. Our convergent research team is primed to work with fire departments, fire personnel, and fire leadership to do so. This planning proposal encompasses two goals: (1) comprehensive empirical and research analysis of current risk reduction programs and scholarly work in this area and (2) foster a multi-regional network of researchers and community partners and establish collaborative research opportunities and interventions. We will achieve these goals in three phases. First, we will document current practices of community and personal risk mitigation efforts through a professional landscape analysis of current programs and tool deployments. Second, we will engage in a holistic scholarship review to comprehensively understand the interdisciplinary research addressing community and personal risk reduction in the fire service. Third, we will establish a national research network through pilot interviews, field visits and a summative design workshop hosted by the Pis. Intellectual Merit The proposed research and planning activities address a critical national infrastructure by building a research network to support the needs of fire and EMS first responders and setting the stage for transformative research in this area. This work will draw on and contribute to the fields of human centered computing, design, risk studies, emergency services, and management by planning a transdisciplinary and translational project focused on the design and management of data-driven IT for risk mitigation in the fire service. Broader Impacts Fire departments are a critical resource for communities around the nation, providing services that are key to the health, safety, and security of individuals, society, and the land itself. Thus, research that will help this critical sector is primed to provide lasting practical benefits that will be most immediately and directly felt by individuals and communities in direct need of crisis response and longer-term risk reduction. As such, this research directly contributes to efforts for more inclusive and equitable infrastructure development and access - with particular implications for inclusive and equitable access to healthcare, personal safety, and property protection.",

However, many of these biomarkers are costly and invasive. As a result, more accessible, performance-based measures of cognitive function are needed to improve early detection, aid in recruitment for clinical trials, serve as clinical endpoints for interventions, and improve access to individuals from underserved communities. In this R01 proposal, we respond to this need and to NOT-AG-21-048, Digital Technology for Early Detection and monitoring of Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD): by leveraging existing longitudinal data of over 3,000 speech samples from two large cohorts, we propose validation of a digital speech biomarker across all stages of ADRD.

Advances in natural language processing and Machine Learning (ML) have made automated linguistic analysis a rapid and effective means for analyzing speech production, while the ubiquity of mobile devices makes remote and frequent digital speech collection widely accessible to more people at risk for AD.  Our central objective is to further develop, increase accessibility, validate, and improve the sensitivity of digital speech biomarkers to ADRD through new analytic approaches and remote collection methods. By pursuing the following specific aims on a large-scale dataset, we investigate early changes in CSL to predict how and when CSL relates to the risk of developing ADRD: Aim 1: Validate connected speech and language measures from older adults across multiple stages of ADRD, including prodromal ADRD, mild cognitive i",

Gardens in early care and education sites that serve vulnerable communities improve interest in and consumption of fruit and vegetables among young children; teach important science, social, and motor development skills; engage families and communities; and offer important outdoor learning opportunities. Drawing on over a decade of co-development and research with community partners, the evidence-based Sustainability via Active Garden Education (SAGE) program fosters deep collaborations among parents, educators, local government, and other stakeholders to increase capacity of farm-to-school programming to reach young children. We aim to disseminate SAGE throughout Arizona in order to improve child nutrition by shaping preferences for and consumption of fruit and vegetables.   ",

Our preliminary data show accelerated longitudinal decline of memory and hippocampal volume in middle-age and older adults (MA+) with ASD, compared to matched controls. This adds to our cross-sectional findings of decreased hippocampal functional connectivity and increased free-water. Free-water is a relatively novel microstructural diffusion tensor imaging technique that is more sensitive than conventional MRI metrics for detecting neurodegeneration. Our preliminary data show baseline hippocampal free-water is a stronger correlate of memory decline in our MA+ ASD than hippocampal volume. For functional MRI (fMRI), it is notoriously difficult to efficiently elicit strong hippocampal activation. Nevertheless, altered hippocampal activity and connectivity have been found in adults with ASD. We developed a relatively brief fMRI memory task and our preliminary data show strong single subject MA+ ASD hippocampal signal. This is promising for functional connectivity data, which we and others suggest may be more sensitive than activation in ASD and aging. We will add this novel task to our ongoing longitudinal MA+ ASD study and link the data with structural MRI measures using our novel multi-modal analysis methods to identify patterns that best predict accelerated memory decline. Our long-term goal is identifying biomarkers and intervention targets for precision medicine care of aging autistic adults. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize hippocampal aging trajectories in MA+ ASD, compared to matched NT adults, and 2) identify the combination of MRI measures that best predict accelerated memory decline in MA+ ASD, compared to matched NT.

Cracks  in  aged  concrete  subjected  to  harsh environs,  the  physicochemical origins of which are well-documented13, serve as highly-permeable pathways for fluids and ions to  migrate initiate  and  expedite physicochemical deterioration processes such as sulfate attack4 and chloride-induced corrosion of reinforcing steel5,6. These deterioration processes accelerate with exposure and loading; and, with  time  (and  absent  intervention),  the  structural  integrity  is  progressively  compromised, leading to premature failure and often devastating impacts. Typical repairs  barring large-scale remove-and-replace exercises  are surface interventions; which only postpone the inevitable loss  of  structural  integrity.  Airfield  pavements  are  critical  military  installations;  and  their structural integrity (via rapid and durable patch-repair) is essential for the DoD to carry out their national security functions. The prolonged construction/repair time not only reduces the mobility and maneuverability of armed forces responsible for protection of construction personnel and logistics, but also puts the forces in harms way by exposing them to threats.  1.2 Overview of the proposed approach: The structural deterioration aspects described above highlight  an  imminent  need  to  develop  strategies  that  can  maintain  full  functionality  of  DoD structures,  and  extend  their  service  lives.  Emergent  materials  solutions  (e.g.,  crack-resistant binders;  fiber  reinforcements;  admixtures  for  binding  deleterious  ions)  are  inapplicable  for extending the service life of aged concrete structures that cannot be easily removed or replaced. For  such  structures,  a  technological  breakthrough  is  needed;  which  combine  innovative strategies to prevent, diagnose, and repair damage (e.g., internal and topographical cracks). This proposal  unifies  the  transdisciplinary  expertise  of  researchers  from  Arizona  State  University (ASU), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T), University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC), and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and industry (Signature Science (SS)) with experience in biological engineering, synthetic biology,  bio-threat  detection,  and  technology  transition  to  Government  agencies;  and  FDH Infrastructure  Services  (FDH),  an  industry  leader  in  engineering,  nondestructive  evaluation (NDE), and remediation strategies for critical defense structures, to develop and implement novel bio-inspired/bio-mediated  vascularization  strategies  to  repair/restore  aged  and  damaged concrete structures, both underground and marine, as well as for runway repairs.  Our approach, elaborated in the Technical Plan (section 2), consists of selecting and deploying suitable  vascularizing/healing  agents  (biological:  bacteria/fungi/enzymes/biofilms;  inorganic: calcium-  and  carbonate-rich  aqueous  solutions),  depending  on the  type  (buried terrestrial or marine), exposure conditions, and nature/extent of damage in the structure. We will use the existing crack-and-pore network in concrete, detected and mapped through state-of-the-art NDE methods,  as  the  vascular  network  to  transport  the  healing  agents  to  the  damaged  locations (internal cracks); as such, intrusive interventions, such as surface drilling or piping to introduce the healing agents, will be obviated. The transport-and-migration of healing agents within the vascular network will be optimized, thereby enabling their penetration into the concrete matrix surrounding the network (which is likely porous because of several deterioration mechanisms), and recruiting them as vascularizing effectors. Through control of composition and genetic make- 1 HR001122S0029 - Arizona State University - CLEVERup of vascularizing/healing agents, and through novel encapsulation-and-delivery strategies, we will  optimize  the  kinetics  of  delivery  of  healing  agents  as  well  as  of  formation  of  cementing products  (e.g.,  calcium  carbonates/phosphates;  aluminate-ferrite-monosulfates)  within  the cracks  in  relation  to  the  type  of  application  (new  concrete  for  runway  repairs  vs.  repair  of buried/marine  structures).  To  demonstrate  vascularization,  we  will  use  state-of-the-art,  non-invasive 3D imaging and acoustic techniques. These techniques will be coupled with reactive-transport models and artificial intelligence (AI) to describe, guide, and optimize the repair of cracks in component- and field-scale concretes.  Outcomes of Phase 1 will determine optimal vascularizing/healing agents and methods for component-scale  buried  and  marine  structures  in  Phase  2.  NDE  techniques  and  models developed in Phase 1 will be extended for use at the component-scale to predict vascularization efficiency and resultant improvements in properties of the restored concrete. We will develop patch-repair materials/methods that encompass vascularizing effectors; and that can enhance the patch material quality independently, and along with the subgrade.  In Phase 3, we will scale-up production of vascularizing effectors, and apply them to military structures. NDE will aid in diagnosis of the buried/marine structures, and in the estimation of restoration efficiency and longevity of the repair. We will develop a coupled structural-transport finite  element  (FE)  model  for  the  test  structure  (considering  damage,  as  informed  by  the mesoscale and component-scale models), and NDE, to provide realistic service-life estimations. 1.3  Current  state-of-the-art  and  limitations:  Conventional  repair/maintenance  approaches generally consider the use of penetrating (e.g., silanes and siloxanes) or film-forming (e.g., acrylic, epoxy,  and  polyurethane  formulations) topical  sealers, which prevent/limit the  movement  of moisture/ionic species into the concrete. However, mismatches in thermal properties and strain capacities between the repair materials and substrate result in premature failure of the repairs. Moreover, repair and restoration of many critical defense structures is limited by inaccessibility of surfaces; since, they are either underwater or underground.  1.4 Potential bio-mediated crack healing techniques: An efficient way to address the above-mentioned  limitations  is  to  provide  aged  concrete  an  ability  to  heal  its  cracks  through  bio-mediated methods79. The self-healing mechanisms generally reported are10: autogenous healing (reaction  of  anhydrous  cementitious  materials  in  concrete  with  water  permeating  through cracks); encapsulated polymers that react and precipitate cementing products when cracks break the shell; and microbially-induced calcium carbonate (CaCO3; e.g., calcite) precipitation (MICP). MICP is a desirable approach, even though large-scale applications of such repair processes have still not been demonstrated. The short life of bacterial spores in the harsh concrete environment imposes practical limitations. However, recent work on bacteria such as Bacillus cohnii has shown that these spores can survive in concrete for ~200 years. That said, owing to the limited amount of CaCO3 produced, cracks wider than ~0.8 mm are unlikely to be healed.  Enzyme-induced  carbonate  precipitation  (EICP)  has  emerged  as  a  promising  means  of producing  calcite  for  soil-strengthening11,12;  and  has  been  researched  extensively  at  the  NSF Engineering Research Center on Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG; several of the  PIs  are  CBBG  faculty)  at  ASU.  In  this  approach,  urease  protein  (enzyme),  a  calcium  salt (acetate  or  nitrate),  and  urea  are  introduced  into  the  cracks  to  precipitate  calcite  as  the filling/binding material; which enhance strength, fracture toughness, and fracture energy of the concrete13.   2 HR001122S0029 - Arizona State University - CLEVERRecent  studies  in  geomycology  have  shown  that  certain  species  of  fungi  can  enable  bio-mediated  precipitation  of  calcite14.  Filamentous  fungi  cells  grow  in  a  thread-like  manner (hyphae), and grow apically with new apices emerging from the formation of lateral branches, creating an intertwined 3D network. This enables extensive vascularization in the structure. The performance of calcite-precipitating fungi in concrete is a less-explored area of research.  1.5  Innovations  in  the  proposed  approach:  Key  innovations  of  the  proposed  work  are summarized below; further details are included in the Technical Plan (section 2).    Selection/design of microbial (bacteria, enzyme, fungi) strains and conditions, which aid in vasculature formation at the repair site; and continually increase stability of the chassis to invade and repair new cracks/damage sites, and aid chassis colonization;     Strain engineering to: (a) Combine beneficial properties of bacteria of various genetic make-ups  to  achieve  vascularization,  MICP,  and  long-term  stability  for  future  repair;  (b)  Effect enzymatic secretion or delivery into the repair site; and (c) Produce bio-organisms that induce biomineralization and organo-mineralization;   Design of proteins/enzymes  attached with isotope or other traceable markers  to fine-tune adsorption,  ensure  penetrability  to  even  small  pores,  enable  electrochemical  transport, enhance precipitate adhesion, and increase the repair durability;    Development of methods to enable inexpensive large-volume active enzyme extraction;   Flexibility of vascularization agent-intrusion methods based on damage-network features;    Robust imaging techniques and high-fidelity testing approaches to evaluate vascularization;    Novel, multiscale NDE methods, coupled with AI-enabled prediction extenders, to detect-and-map cracks and defects in concrete, and detect/quantify deleterious chemical species;    Multi-physics coupling between reaction, mechanics, and transport to represent the healing process and its evolution, towards structural-transport models, and service-life prediction.  1.6 Technical challenges and mitigation: Some of the key challenges and mitigation measures are detailed here (C stands for challenge, and M for mitigation).    (C):  Achieve  vascularization  at  the  repair  site  for  ongoing  repair;  (M):  Capitalize  on  the intrinsic properties of microbes to form vasculature within repair site; and use additives to draw biofilm into the damaged area, and form part of the vascular matrix;   (C): Long term system stability and repair; (M): Utilize spore-forming bacteria that remain dormant over time; utilize/engineer strains with less dependence on the addition of external agents to perform ongoing repairs; utilize biofilms that adhere to and persist on the concrete surface during and following the repair for significant time scales; encapsulation strategies;     (C): Filtering of proteins from the solution before reaching the repair site due to adhesion on crack walls; (M): Modify the protein surface charge by tuning its chemical structure;    (C): Ensuring application methods are optimal; (M) Extensive experiments with specimens of different dimensions and different crack-network conditions, and application scenarios;    (C): Interpretation of ultrasonic backscattered fields for damage detection; (M): Numerical simulations of wave propagation in concrete to guide experiments and interpretation;   (C): Need for large volumes of reliable data to train the AI-model; (M): Air-coupled ultrasonic sensors that enable large volumes of signal data to be collected;    (C): Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) limitations in describing diffusivity; (M): Transition from one-phase flow (only in the pores) to two-phase flow (within the matrix and the crack).   3 HR001122S0029 - Arizona State University - CLEVER1.7 Potential end users and impact: Our mission is to devise novel strategies to ensure that aged concrete in DoD sites, subjected to harsh environments and/or extreme loading conditions, is brought to a state of good repair. In that respect, the potential end-user is the DoD. However, concrete is the foundational material of transportation, energy, and buildings infrastructure; and its premature deterioration and loss of serviceability results in severe adverse societal/economic impacts. Thus, we anticipate the advances made here to benefit other concrete infrastructure.  2.0 TECHNICAL PLAN: Herein, both technical areas, program tracks, and multiple challenges listed in the FOA are addressed. We will evaluate methods that can be applied to both terrestrially buried concrete and marine concrete, in the Strategic Track (see plan in Fig. 1). Table 2 (appended at the end) lists all the tasks, responsible members of the team, timeline, and milestones.   Fig. 1: Overall technical plan as envisaged by the team 2.1 Phase 1: Vascularizing effectors at the materials scale: The objectives for this phase are to: (1) Screen candidate approaches for vascularization and identify potential methods, including those  for  delivery  for  Strategic  and  Tactical  Tracks;  (2)  Evaluate  the  efficiency  of  selected approaches  to  heal/fill  cracks  through  robust  imaging/sensing  methods;  and  (3)  Develop, implement, and validate multi-scale models to predict the properties of interest. The plans to accomplish  these  objectives  are  described  below.  Both  microscale  (small  paste  samples)  and mesoscale specimens (concrete prisms, beams, cylinders) will be employed in this phase.  2.1.1 Screening vascularization approaches: We begin by examining the cracks in aged concrete samples from DoD structures, acquired by FDH from several past DoD projects. This will provide an  indication  of  crack  widths/depths,  network,  and  their  distribution  as  a  function  of  the deterioration mechanism (corrosion of steel rebar; sulfate attack; ASR: alkali-silica reaction; etc.), which  will  be  instrumental  in  guiding  the  selection  of  vascularization  mechanism(s)  for component- and field-scale applications. FDH will compile information on the current condition of concrete, legacy mixture designs, and the likelihood and nature of in-place crack-and-pore networks that may serve as a delivery system or toehold for the formation of more functional  4 HR001122S0029 - Arizona State University - CLEVERbio-inspired vascular networks. The broad diversity in our team and the related expertise gives us the ability to explore a wide variety of candidate vascularization/healing agents for concrete.  Enzyme-induced calcite precipitation (EICP): Here, we propose EICP methods for crack healing, utilizing  our  expertise  in  EICP  and  protein  chemistry,  and  optimize  protein  properties  for penetration into concrete and aid in crack filling. Identification and extraction of the optimal enzymes15,  their  carriers,  and  applications  will  be  evaluated  with  respect  to:  the  source; derivatization  strategy;  encapsulation  mechanisms;  stability;  adhesion  to  pore/crack  walls; precipitation kinetics; and product morphology. The delivery aspects will be investigated using microfluidic channels of different sizes and surface charges, as an analogue to the cracks. Tuning the surface charge of the proteins will also be explored as a means to leverage electrokinetics to further penetrate the proteins to the desired initiation site of crack filling.    Microbial  (bacteria)  induced  calcite  precipitation  (MICP):  In  this  task,  we  will  leverage microorganisms from the Bacillus genus and related organisms (e.g., Sporosarcina pasteurii) for chassis engineering, to develop vascularizing, self-healing networks for concrete repair. These bacteria provide a genetically tractable background with an established body of work supporting MICP16,17.  The  ability  to  form  endospores  enables  production  scalability;  whereas  biofilm formation enables vascularization within concrete edifices18,19. We will use highly resilient non-lab strains, as bacterial chassis for engineering calcite-producing operons, and accessory genes to identify robust calcite precipitation. We will examine species and strain background, ureolysis operons, and promoter strength. Development of vascularization will use the quorum sensing and  biofilm-forming  capabilities  of  optimized  strains.  Since  biofilm-promoting  conditions  can further enhance biomineralization, putative growth additives that facilitate motility and biofilm formation will be assessed. We also plan to utilize solid state fermentation (SSF) to support the establishment of high-biomass MICP strains to rapidly colonize, invade, vascularize, and repair cracks in subterranean/marine environments2022. Modulation of the underlying foam properties (e.g., polyurethane) may aid in vascularization by decreasing the foam density to support a more porous network following spore outgrowth and biomineralization. The foam may also be utilized as a carrier for metabolites required for efficient bacterial growth, MICP, or biofilm formation. Fungi  as  a  vascularization  effector:  Many  fungal  species  produce  long,  branched  structures (hyphae) that may serve to automatically vascularize a repair site. To this end, we will investigate the utility of multiple fungal species (i.e., T. reesei; A. nidulans; and F. oxysporum)23. We will also assess whether the formation of fungal hyphae may form the basis of vasculature under which subsequent colonization by an MICP system may transit and effect future repair. Fungal species will  also  be  assessed  for  their  reported  compatibility  with  SSF  so  as  to  direct  fungal  hyphae growth into the specific area of concrete damage24.  Inorganic solutions: Aqueous solutions supersaturated with Ca2+ will be infiltrated into concrete by  means  of  pressure/electrokinetics,  using  concretes  intrinsic  crack-and-pore  network  as pathways  (vascular  network)  to  transport  the  solutions  to  the  damaged  regions.  Next,  a carbonate (CO32-)-rich solution (e.g., Na2CO3) will be infiltrated. The enrichment of Ca2+ and CO32- at the damaged site is expected to result in a nucleation-and-growth event of calcite, prompting rapid damage healing. The influences of chemistry, rate of delivery, and time-delay between the delivery of the solutions on the rate and extent of product formation will be monitored. We will also evaluate other Ca-based cementing/healing agents such as hydroxyapatite25 (precipitated through  interactions  between  Ca2+-rich  and  PO43--rich  solutions);  calcium-silicate-hydrate  5 HR001122S0029 - Arizona State University - CLEVER(precipitated  through  interactions  between  lime-saturated  and  H2SiO42--rich  solutions);  and monosulfoaluminate26 (precipitated through interactions between lime-saturated, Al(OH)4-rich, and  SO42--rich  solutions).  The  latter  two  are  attractive  because  of  their  intrinsic  cementing characteristic; and their ability to chemically bind Cl- ions (an ability calcite does not have).   2.1.2 Efficiency of selected approaches: We will simulate concretes with differing degrees of crack-/pore-connectivity, to mimic aged/deteriorated concretes. Such specimens will be made very early in the life of the project, to ensure appropriate aging. The application methods will be geared  towards  pushing  the  vascularization  deep  down  (e.g.,  pressure,  electrokinetics).  The number/spacing of the test sites (ports) will be dictated by the extent of cracking, application material/method. The efficiency of the selected diagnostic processes will be demonstrated for buried/marine  structures,  and  repair  of  runways.  We  will  also  select  the  mesocosm-scale testbeds and diagnostic methods, in consultation with FDH who will lead the large-scale testbeds.  Diagnostic and microscopic tests for crack filling: Mortar/concrete samples will be mechanically damaged  in  compression,  compact  fracture,  and  four-point  flexure  tests;  treated  with  the vascularization agents; and subjected to simulated underground or marine exposure. Efficacy of the  vascularizing  effectors  in  terms  of  penetration  and  crack  filling  will  be  investigated  by  a combination of bulk imaging techniques (e.g., CT; local imaging techniques such as XRF; and SEM). 3D CT images of damaged, untreated samples will be compared against those of damaged samples  treated  with  vascularization  agents;  to  assess  vascularization  penetration.  Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and XRF mapping will be carried out to quantify microstructural features (e.g., porosity; solid-to-solid connectivity; etc.) at repair sites. Mechanical  property  and  durability  tests:  Compressive/flexural  strength,  fracture  tests,  and transport properties (e.g., sorptivity; Cl-/moisture diffusion coefficients) will be evaluated after damaging the specimen, and after treatment to quantify the combined efficiency of the effector and the application method on healing. Rapid indicators of property development during the healing  process,  including  NDE-based  estimation  of  elastic  modulus,  will  be  obtained.  Test methods will also include accelerated durability tests, including those for corrosion of reinforcing steel,  and  sulfate  attack.  For  expedited  repair  applications,  we  will  evaluate  the  fatigue performance of vascularized concretes, and contrast them against the state-of-practice.  NDE of cracked and vascularized concrete: We will employ ultrasound scatter, and non-linear ultrasound propagation methods27,28  to  characterize/quantify the  crack-and-pore  network,  as well as to infer the crack-filling efficiency of healing materials. These techniques bring significant innovation in characterizing sub-millimeter sized defects and their interconnectivity. Nonlinear response  characterization  using  ultrasonic  data  interpreted  through  physics-informed  neural networks  (PINN)29  will  be  used  for  the  first  time  to  extract  global  material  characteristics, especially for access-limited structures.  Ionic species detection: Non-invasive detection of deleterious ionic species (e.g., chlorides and sulfates) will be accomplished using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) signal attenuation30. The GPR method provides accurate measurements of chloride and sulfate contents in concrete up to depths  of  tens  of  millimeters  from  the  surface;  but,  beyond  that,  the  accuracy  declines.  To overcome  this  problem,  we  will  employ  machine  learning  (ML)  models  trained  using experimentally-obtained  (e.g.,  using  proton-induced  x-ray  emission,  PIXE)  spatio-temporal profiles  of  chloride  and  sulfates  in  laboratory-scale  concrete  specimens  (both  cracked  and pristine, and of different dimensions and geometries). Results obtained from 100s of such tests  6 HR001122S0029 - Arizona State University - CLEVERwill  be  used  to  train  the  ML  models.  The  ML  models  can  then  be  used  to  extrapolate  the abundances of these deleterious ions at larger depths of concretes (>0.5 m from the surface), simply using (as inputs) their abundances and distributions in topographical sites no deeper than 50 mm from the surface (as measured by the GPR method).         2.1.3 Multi-scale coupled models for reaction, transport, and mechanical properties: Migration of  species  within  the  crack-and-pore  network  (driven  by  pressure/electrokinetics),  and  their spatio-temporal distribution, will be modeled using the Lattice-Boltzmann method on CT scans. The chemical dynamics of healing agents will be reproduced by a thermo-kinetic model. MOSAIC model31 developed by ORNL will be used to represent the mechanical behavior of the system at different degrees of crack filling. At the meso-scale, the material response will be modeled using the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM)32. A multi-physics heat-and-reactive mass transport model that fully couples LDPM will be used to represent the healing process evolution. The full coupling  between  the  model  and  damage/cracking  in  LDPM33  will  enable  the  diffusivities  of moisture and mass (healing agent) to be functions of crack opening, and at the same time, update the  constitutive  relations,  reflecting  the effect  of  healing  on  the  restoration of  strength. The model outcomes will be verified against mechanical tests on treated and untreated specimens. Ultimately,  when  the  model  is  rigorously  validated  against  experiments,  it  will  serve  as  a prognostic tool for a priori predictions of crack-healing efficiency; and, help select the optimal type and quantity of healing agents in relation to the nature/extent of damage in concrete.   2.2 Phase 2: Component-scale evaluation: The objectives of this phase of the work are to: (1) Ascertain  optimal  vascularization  approaches  for  both  Tracks  for  component-scale  and  final application;  (2)  Component-scale  testing,  and  demonstrations;  and  (3)  Develop  validated component-scale  models.  Vascularization  approaches  performing  satisfactorily  based  on  the testbeds for multiple structural types in Phase 1 will be chosen.  2.2.1 Component-scale testing:  Beams, slabs, and columns will be used as component-scale testbeds. Furthermore, FDH will work with DARPAs IV&V partners to select suitable component-scale tests. For patch-repair tests, interfaces between new and aged concrete will be considered.  Patch-scale application methods and test methods: The patching material will have vascularizing agents mixed into the concrete. Slab specimens will be prepared; and cubes/cylinders will be extracted to test the properties. Different methods of vascularization, including encapsulated agents, will be evaluated. Specimen preparation will include bi-layer specimens (patch layer over a base layer), to simulate field repairs. We will extract specimens from the bi-layer slabs, and evaluate their interface bond strength, as well as flexural fatigue response. Specimens prepared in  accordance  with  the  current  patch-repair  methods  will  be  compared  against  equivalent vascularized systems, in order to ascertain the enhancement in fatigue response.  Application methods and NDE approaches for integrity: Here, we will introduce crack-paths in large reinforced beams and columns using soluble fibers (E-glass) in the matrix as well as pre-cracking via controlled loading. The crack-networks will be imaged using NDE methods described in Phase 1. We will ensure that long surface cracks are available (in beams/slabs) so that the application can be carried out through surface ports. The treated components will be spatio-temporally evaluated using NDE methods to ascertain the presence of vasculature. Diagnostic imaging  of  chloride  and  sulfate  concentrations,  coupled  with  AI-based  predictions  of  spatio-temporal profiles of ions (section 2.1.2), will be used to determine if the restored concrete is able to effectively reduce the ingress/migration of these deleterious ionic species.    7 HR001122S0029 - Arizona State University - CLEVER2.2.2 Component-scale modeling: The rich physics-based predictions acquired at the mesoscale will  be  up-scaled  to  the  component-scale  using  adaptive  mathematical  homogenization,  and coarse  graining,  which  have  been  applied  to  simulations  of  ASR-induced  damage,  creep, shrinkage, and mechanical behavior at ORNL. More details on the proposed methods can be found elsewhere3436, which will be adapted for the vascularized concretes.  2.3 Phase 3: Scaling up vascular effectors and application: The major objectives are to: (1) Scale-up vascular effector production; (2) Application to the test-, and field-structures (buried/marine structures, and runway); and (3) Structural-scale assessment and model development.  2.3.1 Scaling-up the production of the effector: We will examine approaches to scale-up the production of effectors for different applications. For MICP/fungi-based vascularization, we will evaluate continued production of the engineered chassis and additional optimization based on testing in Phases 1 and 2. For EICP-based vascularization, we will scale-up crude urease extraction from plants and explore methods to modify the enzyme. This is likely an economical approach for scaled-up applications as demonstrated by ASU in field implementation of soil strengthening. Inorganic solutions, which can precipitate calcite and cementing agents rapidly within damaged regions of concrete, will also be evaluated in large-scale structures.  2.3.2 Application to test structures: FDH and IVV partner will lead the tasks on applications.  2.3.3 Structural-scale assessment and model development:  NDE for in-place structures: Although specific diagnostic NDE signals may appear functionally relevant for concrete structures, the structural detailing and service environment associated with strategic track facilities can render the signal unusable for its intended purpose. Many of these constraints  are  unique  to  these  facilities;  and  their  resulting  effects  on  the  performance capabilities of many NDE methods is a challenge. FDH has been systematically identifying and evaluating several NDE tools for characterizing concrete under realistic operational conditions. In many cases, data from different NDE methods must be fused through signal processing and FE analysis to obtain reliable results. In line with this thinking, we propose an initial NDE schema based on ultrasound  scatter-and-imaging to  locate  regions of  cracking, non-linear  ultrasound propagation  measurements  to  characterize  global  crack  density,  and  photogrammetry  to characterize the accessible outer surface of structure. We propose to create external/internal volume  images  that provide  meaningful  information  about  the  inspected  element  so  that  an engineer, or an AI tool can interpret data to make relevant decisions on the structural condition.  Structural-scale models: To develop reliable predictive structural models, data from NDE tests and validated mesoscale models, combined with full-scale and/or component-scale structural tests (Phases 1 and 2), will be employed, to calibrate the developed FE models. A digital twin of the in-service constructed component or facility will be the terminal output. The digital twin can be used to predict structural response, and can be readily updated with new data on loading or on deterioration/damage. Since healing is time-dependent, the parameters extracted at different healing times can used to infer the structural and transport performance during healing, which will be used in the FE model towards developing a service-life model for the repaired structures.   3.0  METRICS:  We  will  confirm  to  the  met",
FP00033591,778,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Reducing sedentary time (i.e., sitting/lying with low energy expenditure while awake) among adults at-risk for diabetes can reduce diabetes risk and improve cardiometabolic health. Sedentary scree time (SST) (i.e., television viewing, social media, and/or video streaming outside of work and educational pursuits) is ubiquitous in American society with >80% of adults engaging in >3.5 hrs/day. SST is predominantly done in the evening, where it has been hypothesized that prolonged eSST may have the most harmful health effects due in part to disruptions to glucose metabolism and sleep. Several existing interventions have successfully reduced SST, including our mHealth-based StandUPTV intervention (R01CA239612, MPI: Keadle, Buman), but intervention durations have been short (= 16 weeks) and no study has evaluated whether SST reductions are maintained post-intervention which ultimately are needed to lower disease risk.Forming an automatic habit by anchoring, or pairing, a new behavior to an existing routine is a promising strategy for behavioral maintenance. Efficacy for this strategy has been shown for behavioral maintenance across several  behavioral domains (e.g., diet, physical activity, medication adherence, sleep, and smoking cessation). In preliminary work by PI Stecher, mindfulness meditation anchored to breakfast or coffee in the morning increased daily meditation performance during an 8-week post-intervention maintenance period. However, implementing an anchoring strategy for maintaining eSST reduction requires remote and objective eSST monitoring mHealth technologies that to date have not been possible. Recently, our team has developed these technical capabilities through our StandUPTV mHealth platform that uniquely enables us to implement and test an anchoring strategy for maintaining reductions in eSST.This study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of anchoring as a novel behavioral maintenance strategy among 48 nationally-recruited adults at-risk for diabetes. Participants will be randomized to one of two mHealth study arms: (a) StandUPTV only (an evidence-based mHealth intervention to reduce SST inclusive of  self-monitoring, education, and 50% reduction in SST target); or (b) StandUPTV + anchoring for maintaining reductions in eSST. The anchoring strategy will use an alert (i.e. mobile notification to disrupt prolonged eSST) to cue an alternative, more active behavior (e.g.,10 min walk) and then provide a financial reward if the active behavior is successfully performed. We will use quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the interventions feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy for maintaining reductions in eSST and improving cardiometabolic outcomes.",

FP00033596,780,,,,,1,,,"Most athletes report the use of nutritional supplements 1, and such use comes with the risk of unintended doping as supplements may contain banned substances.2,3 A positive doping test, as the result of using a contaminated nutritional supplement, could lead to negative consequences on health, or suspension or even expulsion from sport 4, resulting in loss of sponsorship, income, and previous achievements. It may also damage relationships with friends, family, and support personnel, as well as permanently affect the athletes reputation and credibility, which are important for future career prospects. Although the use of certified third-party tested supplements is considered a safe alternative to not using nutritional supplements 5, our data suggest that supplements are tremendously popular, and 50-80% of athletes still use uncertified supplements 6,7 regardless of strict liability for drug negative tests instituted by (inter)national sport organizations. Currently, a major obstacle in the field of inadvertent anti-doping is that there are very few data available about athletes attitudes and barriers that would predict the use or non-use of certified third-party tested supplements.8 It is, therefore, difficult to target specific athletes that need more or different types of coaching and education on the topic of safe nutritional supplement use. To solve this problem, we propose to examine athlete attitudes towards dietary supplements using a validated questionnaire and use this input to determine predictors that can be used in the form of a new short questionnaire to identify student-athletes that make risky nutritional supplement choices. Therefore, the goal is to develop a new short screening questionnaire to allow athletic departments to identify student-athletes that are not using certified third-party tested supplements. This objective will be realized by working on two dependent sub-aims and accompanying hypotheses which are: 1A) To present student-athletes with a questionnaire, with high content validity, to determine their knowledge of, attitudes toward, and motivations for using third-party tested products, as well as barriers to their use and their access to their sport organizations nutrition resources and services. Hypotheses: Athletes that buy principally third-party tested products will 1) have higher supplement knowledge survey scores and 2) report more positive attitudes toward and motivations for third-party tested products than those that mainly buy supplements that are not third-party tested. 1B) From this collective information we aim to identify responses that predict attitudes that are related to the use of nutritional supplements that are not third-party tested. To our knowledge, this will be the first athlete survey that will allow such a critically important prediction. The outcomes will be illustrated in an infographic that can be used by CPSDA as part of member education.It is important to emphasize that this project is not directly trying to change athlete-behavior, but it aims to arrive at predictors to identify unsafe supplement use so that sports RDs and their athletic departments can follow up with athletes that need more guidance.",
FP00033606,781,,,,,1,,,"Over two million Americans have clinically diagnosed language impairments (aphasia) due to stroke. It is critical to maximize the communication abilities of individuals with aphasia, as they are the top predictor of post-stroke quality of life, self-sufficiency, long-term compliance with physical and occupational rehabilitation programs, as well as caregiver stress and burden. Despite the importance of communication in aphasia outcomes, current research regarding both speech production and comprehension treatment approaches in aphasia generally suffer from low effect sizes and poor generalizability. One major roadblock to effective aphasia treatments has been that most prominent aphasia assessments lack consideration of prosody impairments, and most treatment approaches indiscriminately increase prosodic information without knowing if it will in fact benefit the individual with aphasia. Prosody  i.e. the pitch patterns in speech of stress and intonation-  is a particularly promising mechanism of speech impairments to address because it is known to interact with the common syntactic, phonological, and semantic therapy targets, and prosody is known to be critical for speech comprehension when language systems are compromised. Yet, prosody is largely understudied and untapped by current approaches to aphasia. The purpose of this proposal is to identify how prosody impairments contribute to speech production and comprehension impairments in individuals with aphasia, and identify optimal prosody-based strategies to improve speech production and comprehension for each individual with aphasia. Individuals with chronic aphasia and age-matched control participants will complete a series of behavioral measures of the effects of prosody in a series of speech production, comprehension, and pitch perception tasks, in addition to resting-state functional MRI and structural MRI protocols. The project has two specific aims: (1) Identify prosody impairments in individuals with aphasia using an extensive behavioral battery of expressive and receptive speech tasks, and (2) Identify the brain networks that support prosody and in which damage is related to prosody impairments using both structural and functional imaging. The long-term objective is to identify new mechanisms underlying impairments in aphasia that can be mitigated with an individualized combination of cueing strategies, neurostimulation, and pharmacological approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Findings from this project will identify new mechanisms underlying speech impairments in aphasia and identify new prosody-related strategies to improve communication, a critical element of self-sufficiency and improved quality of life for millions of stroke survivors and their caregivers.",

Project title: A prescription for nutrition: a collaboration to identify, educate, and manage the metabolic syndrome and its complications in a high risk, underserved population 6.  Project start date (intended): 09/01/2022       7.  Project end date: 08/31/2024 8.  Total Project Budget: $307,516.00    9.  Provide a brief 2-3 paragraph summary description of the project   NNI Request Amount  The purpose of this project is to engage, enable, educate and empower a low- income population to improve their metabolic health through an innovative food is medicine approach that also utilizes education, community voice and existing public programs to improve health equity and craft sustain and solutions. Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors which requires fulfillment of 3 out of 5 criteria for formal diagnosis; these include central obesity, elevated LDL, decreased HDL, hypertension, and elevated fasting glucose levels. There is a well described increase in morbidity and mortality in patients with metabolic syndrome, and early identification and intervention is vital to decreasing risk. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2005-2016 the overall prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the United States approaches 34%, with Mexican Americans having the highest age-adjusted prevalence at nearly 39%. Patients with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for other serious health complications as well including fatty liver disease, liver cancer, chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea and cognitive decline. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has identified 2 primary therapeutic goals for the metabolic syndrome: treating underlying causes by intensifying weight management and increasing physical activity and treating cardiovascular risk factors.  This project has three primary aims: 1.) to identify and risk-stratify an underserved population of primarily Hispanic descent at increased risk of metabolic syndrome and its complications 2.)   to educate patients and increase health literacy about the medical complications of obesity and how healthy nutrition can promote weight loss and lower these risks 3). to create a lifestyle intervention opportunity based on increasing access to fresh and healthy culturally appropriate food and nutritional education. We hypothesize that education about the complications of obesity and increasing access to healthy food via sustainable community partners and resources will promote weight loss and lead to improvement in features of the metabolic syndrome, specifically obesity, diabetes and hypertension.  We plan to enroll 100 patients via expansion of our partnership with Adelante Healthcare, a large local Federally Qualified Health Center with 9 Arizona locations, through this initiative with disparities researchers and SNAP-Ed educators from the UA Cooperative Extension. Efforts will also be supported by nutrition students at ASUs College of Health Solutions. Adelante Primary care providers and health navigators will identify high risk patients and follow them over the course of the study period with regular measurements of BMI and surveillance laboratories. Inclusion criteria include BMI > 30 and presence of an elevated hemoglobin A1C >9 or hypertension as defined by a systolic blood pressure > 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure >90.  Summary of Project  Community Advisory Board In an effort to maintain a community focused, informed and empowered approach to this study, a community advisory board will be formed consisting of at least two Adelante patients, an Adelante patient navigator, representative from the Arizona Food Bank Network, a community representative from St. Marys Food Bank and a member of our research team. Within the parameters of available resources and operations through both Adelante and St. Marys Food Bank, the Board will consider best methods of communicating with and engaging participants, culturally appropriate content for food boxes and education components, existing barriers to publicly available resources and programs and strategies to better connect participants to those resources during and after the study.   Screening        Identifying Adelante patients at high risk for metabolic syndrome (and associated conditions) through existing primary care records and based on inclusion criteria: BMI > 30, and elevated HbA1C and/or hypertension.   Referral to Study Adelante health navigator to engage 100 identified patients and invite them to participate in study. Incentives include an annual $15 gift card (maximum amount allowed at Federally Qualified Health Centers) for a store identified by the Community Advisory Board, healthy food provided at no cost throughout study, nutrition and health education and opportunity to help inform equity focused approaches and interventions to improve health outcomes in their community.  Nutrition Intervention Enrolled participants will receive a healthy food box from St. Marys Food Bank curated in partnership with the research team including fresh produce and grains every other week of the study. One a month, nutrition faculty experts and students from Arizona State University and internal medicine resident physicians and GI fellows from the Mayo Clinic Arizona will provide dynamic and engaging culturally appropriate nutrition and health education. Participants will also receive a food prescription to be used once a month at a mobile food van provided by St. Marys Food Bank on site at Adelante where they have the option to choose their own fresh items, including produce and dairy, to fill their prescriptions, thereby building agency, utilizing education components and becoming comfortable with an existing public resource in the community.  Evaluation At the onset of the study, the relevant clinical biomarkers will be recorded and all participants will complete a pre-study bilingual simple survey measuring health and nutrition knowledge as it relates to risk for metabolic syndrome and associated conditions. At conclusion of study, the same biomarkers will be recorded and participants will complete a post-study bilingual simple survey measuring health and nutrition knowledge. Results will be recorded and analyzed for effectiveness in improving clinical biomarkers, nutrition and health education. The research team will report these findings along with recommendations and opportunities for sustainability created in collaboration with the Community Advisory Board to be delivered to funding source and utilized to inform and author at least one peer reviewed academic publication.

In what geography (state(s), county, city) will the funded program/work be primarily implemented?   Phoenix, Arizona     12.  Provide an analysis and scale of the problem/needs in the community targeted by your interventions. There has been a surge in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the United States, with a pronounced disparity in Hispanic communities. Between 2011 and 2016, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome has increased from roughly 33% to more than 40% among Hispanics. This is compounded by concurrent increases in other chronic conditions and comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Moreover, research also shows Hispanic adults experience some of the worst access to health care services and report the worst perceptions of their general health across all racial and ethnic groups.   In Arizona, Hispanics make up an estimated 31.7% of the total population and more than 42% of the states capital, Phoenix. As a significant and ethnically diverse population center, food accessibility in Phoenix is a pressing issue contributing to downstream health disparities. According to the City of Phoenix, there are at least 43 food deserts impacting more than 4 in 10 residents. Throughout Maricopa County, an estimated 200,000 Arizona residents must travel more than a mile to reach the nearest supermarket. Poor access to affordable, nutritious food represents a significant inequity which exacerbates efforts to prevent or manage metabolic syndrome in underserved populations. While efforts have been made to improve the availability and accessibility of both food and health care resources in Phoenix, there is an opportunity to leverage and combine existing resources to more effectively meet patients where they are.

To test the effectiveness of a social determinant of health intervention built upon a  food is medicine plus education approach in improving the metabolic health of a low-income, predominantly Hispanic patient population served at a Federally Qualified Health Center in a major American city.  2.  To identify patients with risk factors for metabolic syndrome including obesity, diabetes and/or hypertension in an underserved, low-income predominantly Hispanic population.  3.  To increase patient knowledge of the health risks of the metabolic syndrome and to empower, enable and engage a pilot group of patients to improve their health, reduce their risk for chronic disease and cancer by through a food is medicine and education approach that inform lifestyle choices and options for themselves, families and communities in the long term.     4.  To enhance and bolster tools and public resources available to health systems and providers     serving under resourced communities to improve health outcomes and key social determinants (i.e. nutrition access and education) of the patients and communities they serve.  5.  To facilitate a sustainable and long-term partnership between Adelante clinic and public institutions in the city, as well as maximize partnerships with state and federal safety net programs, that are already working to address food access and nutrition education to improve health outcomes.   Anticipated Outcomes 1.  Short-Term/Mid-Term: Improvement in one or more of the metabolic syndrome parameters including decreased weight, improved hemoglobin A1C, improved blood pressure and/or ability to decrease medications being taken to treat these conditions 2.  Short-Term/Mid-Term: Patients will demonstrate improved knowledge and health literacy using the existing health literacy screener employed by the clinic and other screeners used to assess health specific knowledge. Obesity literacy will be measured via questionnaires assessing patients baseline knowledge of obesity and its risks including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, liver disease and liver cancer. Education will be provided on the high prevalence of obesity and its aforementioned complications. The same questionnaires will then be administered after completion of the project to assess for change  3.  Long-Term: Development of a system that allows providers to connect patients directly to existing community resources such as SNAP food benefits, SNAP education and existing food banks to improve food access and nutrition knowledge.  4.  Long-Term: Formalized relationships and programs with community patterns and train appropriate staff regarding health education and/or create formalized student internship or capstone placements for health education program.  15.

Describe how the project will incorporate community input/involvement in program design and implementation. Further, please describe how your project will benefit the community and build capacity of local stakeholders to sustain impact. Prior to the intervention beginning, a community advisory board will be formed to determine the needs of the identified community.  This will ensure that local stakeholders (patients, clinicians, community health workers, community non-profit agencies, food security advocates, research team member) have a voice in the design and ultimate outcomes of the intervention to allow for its ultimate success and sustainability after the formal project has ended.  Community board members will serve an invaluable role in informing the study regarding existing barriers, building trust, supports needed and culturally appropriate strategies. In this way, the research team will gain a deeper understanding of the community and long-term solutions will be community informed and empowered.  Once patients are identified as having obesity, diabetes, and/or uncontrolled hypertension,  the research team will provide patients with education on the risk factors of these diseases including risk of possible complications with disease progression. Clinicians will outline in detail the management plan to help prevent progression of the disease which will include healthy weight loss through lifestyle modifications, with diet and nutrition education being the cornerstone of this intervention.             Arizona State University, College of Health Solutions includes faculty and students in the fields of nutrition, population health, medical studies, health sciences, health policy and the science of health care delivery.  Faculty will facilitate partnerships with the local food bank and ensure healthy food items are distributed through their distribution channels.  Patients will be provided with resources on how to choose items from the food bank and the items to choose from each food group.  Students will have the opportunity to be involved in each step of the process and provide nutrition education as well as health literacy information to the patients.   Through the health navigator, participants will also be screened and connected to any local, state or federal public supports for which they may be eligible, including local food bank delivery, state Medicaid benefits, federal SNP and WIC programs, etc. If participants are interested, the navigator can assist in navigating the application process as well. In this way, participants not receive the food and education intervention of the study, but also connect to long term already available programs that can benefit the health of themselves, those of their families and even larger communities for years to come.   19.  Describe how project is related to your organizational goals and how participating in the project will strengthen organizational capacity. Mayo Clinic strives to increase the diversity of the population it serves, and its partnership with Adelante healthcare is helping to achieve this goal.  Mayo Clinic Arizona physicians volunteer their time to work with Adelante patients in a free monthly clinic set up for colon cancer screening and general GI symptoms and through our interaction with this subset of patients we identified an opportunity for further intervention to identify and treat patient risk factors for the metabolic syndrome.  The funding from this project would allow us to expand our care so that Mayo Clinicians can include screening and identification of patients at high risk for metabolic syndrome in this high risk, underserved population.   The burden of the metabolic syndrome is significantly higher in the Hispanic population, the very demographic that Adelante serves.  In addition, many of Adelantes patients suffer from low socioeconomic status and food insecurity and often do not have the ability to choose healthy food for themselves or their families because of lack of access.  Mayo Clinic Arizona is a national leader in healthcare and this project would allow us to partner with colleagues at ASU Health Solutions and the community to help serve as a model of how industry, academia and community practices can come together to find solutions for preventable diseases among the underserved community.  The College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University includes equity and inclusion as one of its core values and missions. It is committed to translating scientific health research and discovery into practice. We prepare students to address the challenges facing our populations to stay healthy, improve their health and manage chronic disease. We bring people together to improve the health of the communities we serve, reaching them where they live, learn, work and play throughout their lifespan. The College of Health Solutions is focused on improving the health of the communities we serve. Every student, every faculty and staff member, every individual and community member should have the opportunity for better health throughout their lifespan. To improve health, we must embrace and support greater diversity, equity and inclusivity in everything we do, including teaching, research and service. The College is committed to doing better and is committed to further embedding community and social determinants of health focused approaches throughout our curriculum, research and external programs. ASU research team members on this study are leaders in the College in the Health Equity and Policy and Affinity Network which focuses on improving curriculum, research, community service and public dialogue in this space, as well College level leadership through the Justice, Equity, Diversity Council. This project allows us to work with leaders in a wide variety of community organizations to reimagine health, build on existing expertise in nutrition, health equity, health policy and community engagement, develop deeper knowledge of the communities we serve and create a better future for people and communities on a local scale.         20.  Please describe in what ways you will partner with other organizations on this program. Include the partners you expect to include (i.e. health departments, community advocates, etc.) and the nature of the partnership itself (what you will be working in partnership to do).  **Include Letters of Support with submitted application This project represents an exciting collaboration between multiple, vital, community partners. We are partnering with Adelante Healthcare, a Federally Qualified Health Clinic located in Arizona with 9 locations throughout the metro Phoenix area. We are also partnering with the Arizona Foodbank Network, a coalition of five regional food banks and almost 1,000 food pantries that is dedicated to addressing hunger in Arizona. This network includes one of the largest food banks in the country, St. Marys Food Bank. In addition, the project will coordinate with University of Arizona Extension SNAP Education program to facilitate nutrition education.

FP00033634,784,,,,,1,,,"Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known to be immunologically cold with a low mutational burden, a high number of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and low T cell infiltration. Prior research indicates that resistance  to  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  (ICIs)  or  adoptive  T  cell  immunotherapy  can  be  mediated  by infiltrating  TAMs.  Therefore,  therapeutic  strategies  that  modulate  the  suppressive  immune  microenvironment (TME)  could  potentially  improve  the  efficacy  of  chemotherapies  and/or  ICIs.  Single-stranded  RNA  origami nanostructures (ssRNAOGs) are nanoscale folding of single-stranded RNA molecules that are readily taken up by  macrophages  and  dendritic  cells,  stimulate  type-I  interferon  mediated  innate  immune  responses,  and subsequently activate adaptive T cell immunity. ssRNAOGs can act as a new class of immune stimulators that can reprogram immunosuppressive TME and sensitize tumors to chemotherapies and/or immunotherapies. In our  preliminary  studies,  we  demonstrated  that  a  novel  ssRNAOG  molecule,  ssRNAOG2,  could  induce  host-defense responses, enhance natural killer (NK) cell activity, and improve the antitumor activity of 5-FU in a PDAC xenograft model, as well as the activity of anti-PD-1 antibody in a syngeneic colon cancer model. In this project, we propose to further develop ssRNAOG2-based novel therapeutic regimens for the treatment of patients with PDAC. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the mechanics of action of ssRNAOG2 in modulation of the PDAC TME, and determine the antitumor activity and biological effects of ssRNAOG2 as a single agent or  in  combination  with  the  standard  of  care  chemotherapeutics  and/or  anti-PD-1  antibodies  in  3D  coculture, patient  derived  immune  organoids,  and  immune  competent  mouse  models  for  PDAC.  Here,  the  central hypothesis is that ssRNAOG2 can modulate PDAC TAMs, reprogram the immunosuppressive TME, and improve the efficacy of chemotherapies and ICIs. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1. To determine the biological effects of ssRNAOG2 in PDAC TME in vitro and in vivo; Aim 2. Determine the biological effects and antitumor activity  of  ssRNAOG2  in  combination  with  the  FOLFIRINOX  chemotherapy  regimen  in  PDAC  3D  spheres, organoids,  and  mouse  models;  and  Aim  3.  To  determine  the  biological  effects  and  antitumor  activity  of ssRNAOG2 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody in mouse models for PDAC.   ",
FP00033634_Res1,785,,,,,1,,,"Project abstract: Pancreatic  ductal  adenocarcinoma  (PDAC)  is  highly  refractory  to  the  current  treatment  options,  including chemo-  and  immunotherapies.  PDAC  is  known  to  have  a  low  mutational  burden,  a  high  number  of  tumor-associated  macrophages  (TAMs),  and  low  T  cell  infiltration.  Although  it  has  shown  remarkable  potential  in several cancer types, immune checkpoint blockade has failed to elicit efficacy in PDAC.  The microenvironment (TME)  of  PDAC  is  characterized  by  a  lack  of  cytotoxic  T  cells  and  a  high  infiltration  of  immunosuppressive immune cells, which makes PDAC immunologically 'cold'.  Therefore, therapeutic strategies that modulate the immune suppressive TME could potentially improve the efficacy of chemotherapies and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors  (ICIs)  in  PDAC.  We  have  used  RNA  nanotechnology  to  develop  single-strand  RNA  origami  nanostructures (ssRNAOGs), which can stimulate a potent innate response primarily to activate NK- and CD8-dependent antitumor immunity and counteract immunosuppressive TAM. ssRNAOGs can act as a new class of immune  stimulators  that  can  reprogram  immunosuppressive  TME  and  sensitize  tumors  to  chemotherapies and/or immunotherapies. In our preliminary studies, we demonstrated that an ssRNAOG molecule were able to induce host-defense responses, modulate TAM and stimulate natural killer (NK) cell activity, and enhance the antitumor activity of 5-FU and anti-PD-L1 in a syngeneic PDAC mouse model. In this project, we propose to reprogram the tumor microenvironments via ssRNAOGs, thereby further enhancing anti-tumor immunity and improving the anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapy/immunotherapy in PDAC models. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the mechanism of action of ssRNAOG in modulating the PDAC TME, and determine the antitumor activity and mechanism of ssRNAOG immunostimulant activity as a single agent or in combination with the standard of care chemotherapeutics and/or ICIs in 3D tumor spheroid models, patient derived immune organoids, and immune competent mouse models for PDAC. Here, the central hypothesis is that ssRNAOG can modulate PDAC TAM, reprogram the immunosuppressive TME, and improve the efficacy of chemotherapies and ICIs. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1. Determine the mechanism of ssRNAOG in PDAC 3D tumor models  (spheroid  cocultures  and  organoids);  Aim  2.  Determine  the  antitumor  activity  of  ssRNAOG  in combination with the FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen in PDAC organoids and mouse models; and Aim 3. Determine the antitumor activity of ssRNAOG2 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody in mouse models for PDAC. To our knowledge, this is the first study that seeks to systematically elucidate the biological effects and antitumor activity of an RNA nanostructure in pancreatic cancer. If successful, it can lead to novel therapeutic regimens that improve the treatment outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer.   ",

FP00033677,787,,,,,1,,,"The vision of the Sustainable Food Systems Research Team is to contribute research that helps to establish a KAITEKI future through the advancement of multiple fields of science, alongside business opportunity development. A KAITEKI future is one in which individuals of the current generation have the ability to maximize their health span (the years of their lives that they are able to live healthfully) without compromising future generations ability to do the same. Accomplishing this depends on many factors, in particular identifying those strategies that match market opportunities (the interests of consumers) with business development (foreseeing future potential for innovative foods and ingredients that contribute to promotion of health and sustainable food supply chains). Our team therefore envisions conducting business-embedded research with relevant units and businesses of Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation (MCHC), such as DAIZ, to identify possible efficiencies in supply chains using methodologies such as True Cost Accounting (TCA). It also envisions research related to the marketing and adoption of products and services that promote health and sustainability, in particular plant-based food products and ingredients. The team finally envisions a collaborative strategic effort between our team and TKI/MCHC counterparts to advance a multi-year agenda for targeted research on the future of healthful, sustainable foods and food ingredients. Taken together, this research will be oriented towards advancing relevant science and informing the business-related decision-making of MCHC to support healthy diets and resilient food systems.Numerous threats of widespread food system disruption exist, which impact all people and all nations simultaneously and in different ways. For example, obesity has tripled across the world population in the past century, not just among adults but also among children and adolescents as well. Obesity in turn, places the individual at risk for many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). T2D costs the world nearly $1 trillion annually. It has become epidemic in many places including Japan, which saw cases grow beyond 10 million for the first time in recent years. On the other hand, heart disease  one of the constellation of conditions comprising CVD  is the leading cause of death in the US and the world, even above COVID-19 according to 2020 data. Such pandemic health problems require innovative solutions for which there is a market among consumers as well as a business opportunity for food and food ingredient producers. Humanity now faces a poly-pandemic of chronic disease, malnutrition, and climate change. These multiple embedded pandemics drive worsening health disparities, a potential regression in progress on the 17 Sustainability Development Goals of the United Nations, and poorer outlooks for the future of global health and environmental sustainability. As such, the only way forward is to address the poly-pandemic in comprehensive ways head on, from individual-level behavior change, focused on chronic disease prevention, to food systems change that drives down the true cost of food.Doing so requires better understanding of the marketplace for products and services that assist consumers in achieving sustained, healthy dietary shifts. Furthermore, it implies that it is essential to work closely with businesses in order to develop and improve tools, products, and services that allow for better decision-making among food systems stakeholders to minimize the true cost of food at all levels. This approach aligns seamlessly with the KAITEKI Institutes vision of building sustainable well-being of people, society, and the planet through research and technological application. It does so by building a unique toolkit for addressing the poly-pandemic and working towards maximized health spans in a way no other research group can do. For example, our research team has been at the cutting edge of food waste reduction research and ideas on the future of food, creating tools never before used that can help individuals build healthier relationships with food. Similarly, our True Cost Accounting team have the ability to create evidence-based, decision-making matrices which can be visualized at the Decision Theater at ASU. This represents expertise and application not available anywhere else in the world that is also directly applicable to corporate-level decision-making. Finally, our behavioral economist team member will apply his expertise to food purchasing patterns that will allow us to explore dietary shifts through big data analysis, exploring a completely new angle to moving consumers towards healthier and more sustainable food choices, such as those offered by DAIZ.

FP00033686,788,,,,,1,,,"Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries (MSKI) account for a significant number of practice loss injuries seen in youth and collegiate sports (Caine, 2006).  Treatment and rehabilitation procedures dealing with MSKI in sports accounts for billions of dollars in health care costs (Cruz, 2019; Lystad, 2019) affecting tens of thousands of families.  The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) recently released a position stance discussing long-term athlete development (Lloyd, Cronin, JB, 2016).  The position paper recognizes the need for foundational training in strength and conditioning to help reduce the risk of injury in competitive youth sports and also establish a pathway to long-term health for children and adolescence.  The availability of qualified practitioners to properly assess youth and young adults for injury risk or sport performance potential coupled with the expense or inconvenience of testing has precluded many coaches and families from utilizing these services.  Recent innovations in the size, portability, and speed of data collection in the areas of MSK strength and movement quality make it much more possible and affordable for athletes to have the correct information to make informed decisions about the need for additional sports performance training.  There is a significant gap in the literature regarding performance measurements as well as potential correlations to injury risk in youth through collegiate athletes across a variety of sports.  This study seeks to close that gap primarily utilizing Vald equipment.This project seeks to accomplish 2 important goals: (1) initial data collection and analysis utilizing a series of performance assessments and a simple health, pain and injury history form; and (2) a 6-month follow-up survey tracking any injuries or change in joint pain status over the 6 month timeframe.  The initial data collection will begin the creation of a large data pool to have normative data across performance tests for various age groups of competitive youth and collegiate athletes.  This data can then be correlated with the performance, health and injury surveys to determine any significant relationships and potentially determine the key metrics that should be assessed in these athletes.",
FP00033691,789,,,,,1,,,"Problem Statement: There is a young, vibrant entrepreneurship ecosystem developing in the Balkans. To date, the small businesses arising from this ecosystem have been largely service-based. However, a recent European Commission Communication on An Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans concluded that there is a significant opportunity for entrepreneurs in the Balkans to make contributions to the digital and green economies. However, success in these areas rests on the regions ability to build its human and entrepreneurial capacity to innovate while promoting social cohesion and economic participation for all members of society.Proposed Approach: Our proposal aims to directly address these needs by helping to establish an inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem for science, technology, and innovation (STI) in the Balkans, by drawing inspiration from the successful NSF I-Corps program in the US. The I-Corps program in the US, based on Steve Blanks Lean Startup curriculum, has helped establish an entrepreneurial ecosystem in academia for facilitating the transfer of STI from academic labs to the market for the benefit of society. Arizona State University has led a NSF I-Corps training site since 2016 and extended this curriculum internationally in several other projects. We propose to do the same here in collaboration with our main partners in the region, Innovation Centre Kosovo (ICK; a GIST Innovation Hub) and the technology transfer office at the University of Prishtina (VentureUP). After co-developing the curriculum, we will recruit a set of diverse teams from Kosovo, Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bosnia and offer the Lean Startup training with an experiential Customer Discovery component to two cohorts, one during the Summer of 2023 and one during the Summer of 2024. The culminating experience for each cohort is participation at ASUs Venture Devils Demo Day, a biannual showcase for ASU-affiliated ventures that will provide opportunities for meaningful interaction between the entrepreneurs and US-based investors and companies.Outcomes and Impact: The broader aims of this project are: 1) the reinforcement of American and scientific values in the entrepreneurship ecosystem in the Balkans and 2) amplification of the impact of science and technology innovation in the Balkans through entrepreneurship training and connections in the US. To that end, we will track several output and outcome indicators at a quarterly interval. Output indicators include the number of teams trained, the diversity of their composition (in terms of gender and ethnicity), the number of hours of training provided, and the number of opportunities for interaction between entrepreneurs and US-based investors and companies. Outcome indicators include mastery of the Lean Startup curriculum and changes in the future plans of the companies following the training. A target for each indicator and a detailed plan for tracking progress are detailed in the proposal.",
FP00033706,790,,,,,1,,,"1.Background and Significance The U.S. is still in the midst of a widespread opioid epidemic. From 1999 to 2019, almost 500,000 people died from an opioid overdose,1 and an estimated 2 million currently have an opioid use disorder (OUD).2 In Arizona alone, more than five people die from opioid overdoses each day3. OUD prevalence is disproportionately high among Medicaid enrollees4,5 and the need for treatment far exceeds the supply of clinicians that prescribe and monitor medications for OUD (MOUD).6,7 MOUD are effective at reducing overdose deaths and improving outcomes, but are vastly underused, with only 25-40% of adults with OUD receiving MOUD.810  Arizona ranks 47th among states in behavioral healthcare providers per capita,11 highlighting the fact that Arizonans are not receiving care that could save lives and resources. A crucial first step in designing healthcare polices to address these OUD care deficiencies in Arizona is to understand how the quality of OUD care and the use of MOUD varies by patient characteristics and by geographical area. Emerging data suggest that disparities are present in the quality of care and outcomes for OUD.  Studies have demonstrated racial, ethnic, geographic, age, and socioeconomic status (SES) differences in overdose death rates1216, patterns of opioid use and OUD,1720 and in patterns of treatment.2124  Though Arizona is unique in its high prevalence of Latinx, Native American, and Black populations among Medicaid beneficiaries (49%, 8%, and 7% respectively25), better estimates using more sophisticated approaches to examining health equity are needed. Few studies do more than scratch the surface of equity in OUD care. Ideally such research would examine types and duration of treatment accounting for differences that layer across dimensions such as race, gender, and age group, often referred to as intersectionality.26   OUD disparities may be exacerbated by differences in regional care availability and quality. Greater distance to MOUD prescribers is associated with lower receipt and lower continuity of MOUD.27 Counties with higher-than-average rates of OUD typically have low treatment capacity and lower quality,  and there are racial/ethnic disparities in the availability of MOUD providers in neighborhoods segregated by race/ethnicity.28  Changes in clinical and practice environments may substantially interrupt patterns of care, disproportionately affect Latinx, Black, and Native communities.29 The long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown, including the impact on quality of care for OUD and further exacerbations of disparities in care.30   Using real-time Arizona Medicaid claims data to characterize provider-level OUD care quality, we will examine differences in OUD care availability and quality by Medicaid beneficiaries intersectional status and reveal key drivers of differences in quality. Our aims are to: Aim 1:  Assess differences in the quality of OUD care by intersectional status, prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. H1.1: Older adults, Medicaid beneficiaries of color, and men receive lower quality OUD care and the differences are most striking at the intersection of these identities. H1.2: Regional factors such as rurality and other social determinants of health impact differences in the quality of OUD care.  H1.3: The receipt of high-quality OUD care declined during COVID while pre-COVID differences in care by intersectional status have been exacerbated during the pandemic.  Aim 2: Assess the extent to which differences in the receipt of high-quality OUD care are due to variations in the availability of providers who provide high-quality OUD treatment by geographic area. H2.1: There are quality of care differences between providers who treat individuals from historically marginalized backgrounds with OUD. H2.2: Because of historical segregation by race/ethnicity due to structural racism, there are differences in the closest distance to a high quality versus low quality provider for Medicaid beneficiaries of color with OUD. Understanding the differences in OUD care quality by intersectional status and the factors underlying and driving those differences is critical to the delivery of equitable, high-quality care in Arizona. By identifying intersectional groups receiving lower quality of care (Aim 1) and drilling down on the contextual factors surrounding these differences (Aim 2), including the local availability of high-quality providers, our results will guide policy makers in designing a smarter set of incentives aimed at improving OUD care engagement and quality for all individuals. These results will set the stage for future large-scale federal and foundation funding to inform health policy regarding the use of continuing medical education and telemedicine for reducing geographical disparities in OUD care.",

FP00033801,794,,,,,1,,,"Title of Project:Reducing Listening Effort of Cochlear Implant Users via Auditory TrainingPrincipal Investigator:Xin Luo, Ph.D.Mailing Address:Speech and Hearing Science, College of Health SolutionsArizona State University, 975 S. Myrtle Av., Tempe, AZ 85287Telephone:480-965-9251Email:xinluo@asu.eduA. BackgroundSpeech recognition is effortful when the target speech signal is degraded due to background noise, the talkers accent, or the listeners hearing impairment (Peelle, 2018). For example, hearing-impaired listeners often complain about mental fatigue after conversations in social events, at work, and in classrooms. Compared to normal-hearing listeners, hearing-impaired listeners have to put more effort in recognizing the degraded auditory inputs, despite the use of hearing aids (HAs) or cochlear implants (CIs) (Ohlenforst et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018). Listening effort is defined as the allocation of cognitive resources (e.g., working memory and selective attention) to overcome the obstacles in listening tasks (Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016), although it may also involve the motivational and emotional responses to the task demand (Francis & Love, 2019). As described in the Ease of Language Understanding (ELU) model (Rnnberg et al., 2013), an explicit rather than implicit process is activated for speech recognition in adverse situations (e.g., with background noise and/or hearing impairment), which maintains selective attention to target speech while inhibiting background noise and uses working memory, contextual cues, and language knowledge to recover missing information and resolve ambiguity in mental speech representations. Elevated listening effort in daily-life speech communication may lead to the breakdown of a conversation, abandonment of assistive hearing devices, withdrawal from social interactions, and in turn, long-term negative impacts on mental health and vocational opportunities (e.g., Edwards, 2007). In light of its vital role in speech communication, listening effort has received increasing attention in recent auditory research. Various methods have been used to measure listening effort. Subjective assessments ask listeners to rate how much effort was used to perform the listening task using surveys such as the NASA Task Load Index (Hart & Staveland, 1988). However, self-reports may reflect the perceived but not the exerted listening effort, and may be affected by the listeners performance in the task and their expectation of the demand (Moore & Picou, 2018). On the other hand, objective assessments of listening effort include physiological and behavioral measures. While the relationship between listening effort and heart rate/skin conductance/blood pressure is still inconclusive (Francis & Love, 2019), pupil dilation has been shown to be sensitive to the increased listening effort with lower spectral resolution, lack of contextual cues, and faster speaking rates (Winn et al., 2015; Winn, 2016; Winn & Teece, 2021). In terms of behavioral measures of listening effort, the most common method uses a dual-task paradigm, in which listeners perform the primary task of speech recognition in noise along with a simultaneous secondary task. There are a wide variety of secondary tasks in the visual modality (e.g., tracking of a moving target, judgement of even/odd digits, judgement of rhyme words and judgement of rotated characters) that differ in task complexity and measurement sensitivity (e.g., Sarampalis et al., 2009; Desjardins & Doherty, 2014; Pals et al., 2013). The basic assumption of dual-task paradigm is that the primary and secondary tasks will draw on the same limited cognitive resources. When the primary speech recognition task is more effortful, it will consume more cognitive resources while reducing the available resources for the secondary task. As the result, degraded performance on the secondary task in terms of slower response time and more response errors is used to indicate the listening effort of the primary speech recognition task.In general, objective and subjective measures of listening effort are not correlated, suggesting that they may assess different aspects of the cognitive load for speech recognition in noise (e.g., Gosselin & Gagne, 2011; Hornsby, 2013; Pals et al., 2013). More importantly, clinical measures of speech recognition in terms of percent correct scores or speech reception thresholds do not always reflect the exerted listening effort (e.g., Sarampalis et al., 2009; Pals et al., 2013; Winn & Teece, 2021). It is possible that different listeners expend different amounts of listening effort to score the same in a speech recognition task, or that a listener keeps a similar speech recognition score with more effortful listening in a more challenging situation. For example, Pals et al. (2020) found that increasing the number of channels in CI users continued to reduce the listening effort even when the speech recognition scores already saturated. These results highlight the importance to measure listening effort in addition to speech recognition performance when assessing the clinical outcomes of assistive hearing devices and the perceptual benefits of novel hearing technologies.In this project, we aim to reduce the listening effort of profoundly deaf people who use CIs to restore hearing. Although most CI users can recognize speech reasonably well in quiet environments, they have limited spectral and temporal resolution, which may largely explain their significantly poorer performance (e.g., Friesen et al., 2001; Fu & Nogaki, 2005) and greater listening effort (e.g., Pals et al., 2013; Winn et al., 2015) for speech recognition in noise than those of normal-hearing listeners. Additional low-frequency acoustic hearing can significantly improve CI users speech recognition in noise (e.g., Dorman et al., 2008), but its effect on listening effort has been mixed (e.g., Perreau et al., 2011; Devocht et al., 2011). In addition to the attempts to convey spectral and temporal fine structure cues to CI users, auditory training has been used for CI users to take advantage of brain plasticity to adapt to the impoverished auditory inputs (e.g., Fu & Galvin, 2007). However, previous studies of auditory training only examined the improvement in speech recognition scores of CI users from pre- to post-training. It is yet to be tested whether CI users listening effort is reduced when the recognition accuracy of mental speech representations is improved with auditory training.B. SignificanceAs reviewed above, there is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the training effect on listening effort in CI users. Until this lack of understanding is addressed, the path forward for reducing the listening effort of CI users will remain unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, this proposal will use a rigorously designed phoneme recognition training paradigm to examine how auditory training targeted at the basic speech components of vowels and consonants may reduce CI users listening effort in addition to improving their speech recognition in noise. In terms of theoretical contributions, the proposed research will provide fundamental data related to the cognitive impacts of perceptual learning of degraded speech with CIs. Specifically, comparison of the response time of the secondary visual task in the dual-task paradigm before and after training will indicate the changes in demand of working memory and selective attention for the primary task of speech recognition in noise induced by auditory training. Regarding clinical implications, our research outcomes will help identify sensitive measurements of listening effort that can be used in the clinical evaluation of CI outcomes. The knowledge gained from this project will also allow audiologists to better understand the cognitive benefits of auditory training to CI users in daily life (e.g., reduced mental fatigue, better multitasking ability, etc.) and make informed recommendations of aural rehabilitation to CI users.C. Experimental DesignParticipants will be 20 post-lingually deaf adult CI users with more than one year of CI experience (i.e., past the initial adaptation period). Half of them will be randomly assigned to the training group, while the other half will be the control group without training. A power analysis of our previous training data (Krull et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2021) showed that a sample size of 10 for the training group would allow us to detect the training effect with a power of 0.90. All participants will be native English-speaking adults who can understand the tasks and commit to participating in the multiple testing and training sessions (1-2 hours each). We do not expect any effect of sex but male and female participants will be recruited in equal numbers from racially and ethnically diverse groups to the extent possible. With an existing large pool of CI users in the Phoenix area, we anticipate no difficulty in recruiting the proposed number of participants. Methods: All participants will use their own hearing devices with daily settings, whether those are unilateral CI, CI+HA, or bilateral CIs. Pre-, post-, and retention-tests of the clinical standard AzBio sentence recognition (Spahr et al., 2012) will be conducted in a sound booth at the ASU Auditory Implant Lab. The combined speech and 10-talker babble noise will be presented via a single loudspeaker at an overall level of 65 dB SPL. In the pre-test, participants will first be tested with an adaptive procedure (Luo et al., 2018) to determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for 50% correct word recognition in sentences (i.e., speech reception threshold; SRTpre). In each trial, the SNR will decrease or increase if more or less than half of the words in the sentence are correctly recognized, respectively. The SRTpre will be the average SNR of the last six reversals with a list of 20 sentences. Participants will then be tested with a dual-task paradigm to measure the listening effort. The primary task will be AzBio sentence recognition at the SNR of SRTpre. Participants will be asked to verbally repeat a list of 20 sentences presented with an interval of ~8 s and their responses will be recorded for later scoring. The simultaneous secondary task will be a mental rotation task. In each trial, two randomly selected Japanese characters will be visually displayed on a computer screen with one of them rotated by 90o. The character to be rotated and the direction of rotation (clockwise or counter clockwise) will be randomly selected. Participants will be asked to judge whether the two characters are the same or not by pressing the corresponding button as soon as possible. The next trial will begin after the button pressing or after ~3 s without a response. There are equal probabilities for trials with the same or different characters. The average response time between stimulus onset and button pressing of the mental rotation task will be used to indicate the listening effort. This kind of measure of listening effort has been shown to be sensitive to the variable spectral resolution in CI users (Pals et al., 2013). After the pre-test, the training group will receive phoneme recognition training online at www.gorilla.com (as in Kim et al., 2021) in a quiet room at home on five days over two weeks. On each day, participants will listen to consonants and vowels at the SRTpre with an overall comfortable level via direct audio input and recognize them in a forced-choice task with a trial-by-trial feedback on response accuracy. If the response is incorrect, participants will get the correct answer and listen to the speech token again. Consonants recorded by Shannon et al. (1999) and vowels recorded by Hillenbrand et al. (1995) will be used for training on each day. A similar phoneme recognition training paradigm has been shown to effectively improve CI users speech recognition in noise (e.g., Fu & Galvin, 2007). The training group will take the post-test one day after the completion of training, while the control group will take the post-test two weeks after the pre-test. In the post-test, the same adaptive procedure as in the pre-test will be used to measure SRTpost. Participants will then perform the dual-task at both SRTpre and SRTpost. This allows us to compare the listening effort at the same SNR (i.e., SRTpre) or with the same speech recognition performance (at SRTpre and SRTpost) before and after training. Retention test will be conducted two weeks after the post-test using the same procedure as the post-test to measure SRTretention, as well as the listening effort at both SRTpre and SRTretention. Different sentence lists will be used in different tests. After the dual-task in pre-, post-, and retention tests, participants will provide subjective ratings of listening effort using the NASA Task Load Index (Hart & Staveland, 1988). Data Analyses: All the statistical analyses will be conducted in R (R Core Team, 2022). A linear mixed effects (LME) model will be used to analyze the SRTs with a within-subject factor of testing session (pre, post, and retention), a between-subject factor of group (training and control), and a random factor of subject. Similar LME models will be used to analyze the subjective rating of the listening effort and the response time of the secondary visual task measured at the same SNR (SRTpre) or with the same speech recognition performance (at SRTpre, SRTpost, and SRTretention) in the pre-, post-, and retention tests. Hypotheses: We generally hypothesize that auditory training can both improve speech recognition in noise and reduce the listening effort of CI users, and that the training effects can largely retain for weeks after training. As such, for the training group, SRTpost and SRTretention would be similar, and both are expected to be lower than SRTpre. The subjective rating of listening effort and the response time of the secondary visual task in the dual-task paradigm measured at the same SNR (SRTpre) would decrease at post- and retention tests than at pre-test. CI users would achieve the same speech recognition performance at lower SNRs with similar listening effort after than before training. In contrast, the control group would show similar SRTs and listening effort in the different testing sessions. Timeline: The experiments will be ready to go at the beginning of 2023. We will focus on subject recruitment and data collection in the first half of 2023. Data analyses and manuscript preparation will start in the second half of 2023 and continue until finished.",
FP00033809,795,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  amplified  the  social  and  health  inequities  experienced  by  racial/ethnic minority populations including Latinxs. It is also widely believed that both mis/disinformation and structural inequalities in the social environment contributed to disparities in COVID-19. However, it remains unclear how  exactly  these  factors  interacted  in  contributing  to  such  disparities.  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to develop a computational understanding of the impact of social media misinformation on vaccine uptake in Latinx communities.  The  central  hypothesis  is  that  the  interactions  between  (exposure  to)  misinformation  and  structural inequalities in the social environment influence health decision-making, and it is possible to quantitatively model such interactions. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Designing and implementing  new  studies  that  define  experiment  and  data  acquisition  protocols  for  best  supporting  the development  of  analytic  models;  2)  Determine  how  to  model  social  media  misinformation  and  online behavior  in  the  face  of  misinformation;  and  3)  Determine  how  precisely  (in  quantitative  terms) misinformation and other adverse conditions interact to impact vaccine uptake.   The proposed research is significant, because it will lead to discovery of a comprehensive, computational understanding of the interactions between social media misinformation and other sociopolitical determinants of health disparities in Latinx communities. Such a computational/quantitative understanding is missing in the current knowledge. Research results from this project will have an important positive impact immediately because  they  will  lead  to  the  development  of  precise  interventions  for  effectively  addressing  the  health disparities.

My research interests are closely related to this phenomenon. I am interested in how we can best support children who speak multiple languages by using their languages during intervention. However, this kind of research can be controversial in the United States. In the US, there are issues with language prestige, which can impact motivation to learn. In other words, children in the US may be less motivated to preserve their home languages due to societal value on the importance of English. Moreover, policies such as English-only education prevent study of multilingualism in some academic settings.  Conversely, in Israel, effects of language prestige can be controlled because the population places value on both English and Hebrew. The present study seeks to examine language transfer. According to Cummins (1978) linguistic interdependence theory, learning in the first language (L1) can be positively transferred into the second language (L2). Notably, intervention studies which have examined cross-linguistic transfer have focused primarily on vocabulary, and they have found that bilingual intervention positively impacts both languages, while intervention in the second language only impacts the second language (e.g., Armon-Lotem et al, 2021; Restrepo et al., 2013). Vocabulary intervention does not need to occur in isolation. Narrative interventions can offer children vocabulary learning opportunities, along with components of micro (e.g., syntax, mental state terms) and macro level communication skills (e.g., story parts and organization).   The present study aims to use different instructional models (blocked: first L1, then L2; blocked: first L2, then L1, and mixed L1/L2) and examine their impact on learning of narrative skills both within and across languages.

Sindhu is a is entering her second year as a PhD student in speech and hearing science, with interest in working on improving intervention for multilingual and multicultural populations.   The proposed project will not present a conflict of interest with Sindhus current responsibilities and commitments. In fact, she currently studies at Arizona State University under a training grant entitled PRIDE, which is designed for preparing researchers in early intervention for children with disabilities from multicultural environments. Thus, this research closely aligns with the goals of her training grant and responsibilities at ASU. She has completed coursework in this regard and is actively involved in research working with bilingual populations in the United States.  The proposed study is important because it addresses a gap in the research in our field, regarding the cross-linguistic transfer of narrative skills. In addition, Sindhu will gain valuable experience working on bilingual research in a country without issues of language prestige. This research will further our understanding of bilingual learning.

Visiting Israel in order to receive narrative sample analysis training for this project is important because Sindhu will be immersed in the multilingual environment of Israel, which is very different from that of the United States. This will be important for her to understand as it pertains to understanding the influences of Hebrew exposure on English narrative language samples. In addition to being immersed in the multilingual environment, Sindhu will also engage in narrative sample analysis training. This is crucial to the research we are doing on cross-linguistic transfer. We will be able to provide Sindhu with an in-depth training on narrative sample analysis and the influences of Hebrew exposure, which she will then be able to use to continue to assist in analyzing English narrative language samples while in the United States.   It would be beneficial to Sindhu to be able to gain this narrative language training in person to truly see the impact of the multilingual environment on narratives and learning. Funding from this grant will enable Sindhu to get narrative language analysis training and invaluable experience working in our lab.   Sincerely, Dr. Carmit Altman Prof. Sharon Armon-Lotem       ",
FP00033923,797,,,,,1,,,"    INDUSTRY SPONSORED RESEARCH AGREEMENT FIXED PRICE Exhibit A:  Scope of Work Description of services:   AIM 1. Create a Gen1 Pediatric Boot prototype that measures heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and temperature (T). The benchtop prototype will record these values and communicate them wirelessly. The prototype will use sampling rates  at  or  above  the  gold  standard  instrumentation  in  the  NICU.  The  prototype  will record  the  data  in  a  wired  and  wireless  manner  to  demonstrate  robust  communication. Milestone 1. The prototype will be demonstrated on the benchtop using contrived input, e.g. arbitrary waveform generators.   AIM 2. Create a Gen2 Pediatric Boot that will include a custom fabricated microneedle array that will sample interstitial fluid in a minimally invasive manner. The array will be integrated  into  the  Gen1  system  with  the  aim  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  recording pCO2,  SpO2,  and  pH.  The  system  will  be  tested  using  spiked  artificial  biofluid. Milestone  2.  The  Gen  2  prototype  will  be  characterized  on  the  benchtop  and  fully characterized.  AIM  3.  The  system  will  be  refined  into  an  integrated  wireless  system  with  a  flexible printed circuit board. Based on the data from the Gen1 and Gen2 devices, we will work with the physicians to determine which of the parameters will be included in the Gen3 device. The circuit board will be embedded into a Pediatric Boot. The boot will be fully characterized on the benchtop followed by characterization on human subjects. No less than 6 human subjects will be tested with the system for the pilot study to determine the power needed for a full study. Milestone 3. Completed Gen3 prototype tested on human subjects.  AIM 4. We will design machine learning techniques to extract digital biomarkers from sensor and EMR data and to predict impending health complications. Data from public repositories as well as two datasets obtained by the investigating team in the past will be used for machine learning algorithm design, training, and validation. Given the success of deep  learning  models  in  detection  and  prediction  tasks  on  time-series  data  in  other domains, we will focus on designing such models for postnatal health monitoring. This will  include  designing  and  testing  models  based  on  convolutional  neural  networks (CNNs),  long  short-term  memory  (LSTM)  networks,  and  transformers,  which  capture long and out-or-order dependencies in the time-series data. We will also design transfer learning techniques that allow utilization of our trained models across different domains (i.e., new patients, times, sensor modalities) without the need for gathering ground truth labels  in  new  domains.  Our  knowledge  transfer  approach  will  play  a  critical  role  in scaling the developed AI technologies to large populations because manual labeling of sensor data is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly.

FP00033969,801,,,,,1,,,"Emergency response protocols for treating overdose in the field often include administration of naloxone to reverse overdose but no standard procedure exists for after the patient is stabilized. Post-stabilization protocols vary widely; some first responders transfer patients to the hospital or call in behavioral health professionals to broker services, while others leave a stable overdose patient without any further service or follow-up. Results from a needs assessment conducted by our team with first responders indicated that first responders shared information on treatment and social service resources <24% of the time. To capitalize on the time after a patient becomes stable following an overdose (but before first responders depart the scene), we created and piloted First Resource. First Resource is a simple, intuitive smartphone application for use by first responders. The app allows first responders to share social service and treatment resources, using motivational techniques, with community members quickly and anonymously. As the only class of provider who consistently administers care to overdose victims in the field, first responders are uniquely situated to improve opioid overdose response and prevent recurrent overdoses in a community. At the point when first responders engage with community members, they have a distinct opportunity to motivate and connect the community member (or their supporters) to providers of key treatment that addresses opioid addiction directly, such as medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and other social and behavioral health services.  First Resource will assist first responders as they work to integrate systems of care, connecting community members to vital social and treatment services. It will also serve as a catalyst for institutional culture change in first responder departments, ensuring that referral becomes a regular and rote end to every crisis response interaction. With our study, we focus on four major aims: Aim 1- Enhance the First Resource app prototype to add new functions and increase usability, triangulating preliminary, in-hand user experience data with new data collected from first responder stakeholders. Aim 2: In a multi-site randomized controlled trial, assess efficacy of the First Resource app in (a) increasing first responders' provision of referrals to patients post-stabilization; (b) increasing compassion satisfaction; and (c) increasing first responder psychological well-being. Aim 3: In a randomized controlled trial, assess efficacy of the First Resource app in (a) increasing patients treatment-seeking behavioral intentions, (b) increasing the proportion of patients who contact a service provider; and (c) increasing patient ratings of first responders compassion. Aim 4: Build statewide stakeholder capacity for connecting overdose patients with follow-up services, and decrease first responder stigma related to OUD. The evidence-based Organizational Process Improvement Intervention (OPII) along with Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) methods will serve as frameworks for FR-BRIEFs approach.",
FP00033985,802,,,,,1,,,"World-Centric Sound-Source Localization: A Multisystem ProcessOVERVIEWOur long-term goal is to improve an understanding of how humans localize sound sources in the actual world (world-centric sound-source localization). The proposal argues that world-centric sound-source localization requires combining information about auditory-spatial cues with information about the position of the head, i.e., sound-source localization is a multisystem, not just an auditory, process.INTELLECTUAL MERITWhile sound-source localization has been studied for over 200 years, the majority of this work involved the role of the auditory-spatial cues (e.g., interaural time differences, interaural level differences, and spectral features) in sound-source localization. Auditory-spatial cues only indicate the location of a sound source relative to the head (head-centric sound location), not relative to the world and other objects in it (i.e., world-centric sound-source location). In addition to head-centric sound location (based only on auditory-spatial cues) not being able to indicate where sound sources are in the world, head-centric locations are prone to cones-of-confusion errors, and cannot by themselves determine if a change in an auditory-spatial cue indicates that the sound source and/or listener moved and, if so, how. To describe more completely sound-source localization in the actual world, communication in noisy and reverberant environments, and navigation using sound requires an understanding of world-centric sound-source localization. World-centric sound-source localization is determined by using multisystem neural processes to combine estimates of the auditory-spatial cues (head-centric cues) and estimates of head position. We will use our unique laboratory in which listeners and sound sources can move and three procedures refined during our previous research efforts (Wallach Azimuth Illusion (WAI), Auditory Filehne Illusion, and Front-Back Reversal procedures) to study world-centric sound-source localization as a multisystem process.BROADER IMPACTSOur sound-source localization work includes basic research and its dissemination aimed at better understanding normal auditory processing. And, we: (1) Have actively engaged students at all levels of their education in our research, (2) Worked to better understand how patients fit with Cochlear Implants (CIs) localize sound sources, and (3) Helped develop a better understanding of the role of sound-source localization in the development of virtual/augmented auditory realities. (1) Educational Impacts: The Spatial Hearing Lab (SHL) engages students [undergraduates; master-level students; clinical speech, hearing and language masters and doctoral programs (AuD) students, and PhD students]; speech, hearing, and language faculty; and clinicians and their patients. The SHLs Research Intern Program hires students each semester as SHL Research Interns to serve as subjects, help run experiments, and assist in SHL research activities. Every other week there is a combined SHL and Auditory Computation and Neurophysiology Lab (ACNL) lab meeting (ACNL is directed by Dr. Zhou who studies auditory cortex in a marmoset animal model) where faculty (basic science and clinical faculty), staff (SHL Research Interns, ACNL, and Clinic Staff), and students working in the SHL, ACNL, and Clinics learn from each other. (2) Hearing Impairment: The SHL has collaborated with Dr. Dormans Cochlear Implant Lab (CIL) studying the ability of CI patients to benefit (including improved sound-source localization performance) from having sound delivered to both ears via bilateral CIs, bimodal use of a CI and a hearing aid, taking advantage of single-sided deafness with one good ear and one fit with a CI, or in rare cases when CIs and hearing aids are fit to both ears. If the opportunity arises, we plan to continue to work with Advanced Bionics (AB, a CI manufacturer) on projects involving sound-source localization and CI patients. (3) Auditory Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR): Facebook Reality Labs has supported SHL research on The Size of the Auditory Scene and how spatial hearing affects that size. That is, in complex auditory scenes (e.g., ones that might be rendered via VR) how many sound sources can listeners perceptually process at one time? If the auditory scene is large, this would require a broad bandwidth VR system and, thus, such systems could be computationally difficult and expensive. A smaller scene would pose less of a challenge and expense. Our research has shown that listeners can only process three or four sound sources in an auditory scene at one time and spatial separation of the sources has a small effect on auditory perception of auditory scenes of this size. Again, when the opportunity exists, we plan to continue our interaction with Facebook Reality Labs to better understand how sound-source localization impacts virtual/augmented realities.",

FP00034010,804,,,,,1,,,"Women aged 50+ years comprise 77% of breast cancer diagnoses and 93% of all breast cancer survivors. Unfortunately, the interaction between cancer treatment and normal aging often results in a number of health consequences. Up to 75% of breast cancer survivors suffer cognitive changes during treatment, and over 45% experience clinically significant cognitive decline pre- to post-treatment. An optimum treatment for cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is likely one integrating interventions known to improve cognition in similar populations, such as older adults. Our previous research supports moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training for improving cognitive function in older adults. This work suggests that physical fitness and brain health may underlie exercise-induced changes in cognitive function. We recently applied an aging framework to gain preliminary information on the effects of physical activity on cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. Our work in this area suggests that aerobic exercise training may similarly attenuate cognitive decline due to cancer and that cancer-related fatigue may represent one source of exercises cognitive benefits in the context of cancer. Our preliminary data in aging and cancer, along with the well-documented benefits of exercise relative to proposed CRCI risk factors (e.g., low fitness, greater fatigue), provide a compelling argument in support of aerobic exercise training for improving cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. While evidence in this area is growing, few large trials have been conducted and none, to our knowledge, with consideration of intervention dissemination and implementation in practical settings. We propose a randomized controlled trial in which 160 post-menopausal breast cancer survivors (3-24 months post primary adjuvant therapy) will be randomized to a community-based aerobic exercise program or health education control (80 per group). Groups will be stratified to ensure equal numbers in each group based on age, stage of cancer diagnosis, and baseline cognitive status. This study utilizes a novel study design that blends investigations of effectiveness and implementation, which will improve our ability to advance scientific knowledge from evidence-based treatment for CRCI to practice in community settings. Our exercise protocol is based upon our previous studies with demonstrated efficacy in older adults without cancer, and our community-based approach is based upon our previous studies with demonstrated implementation success in breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women without cancer. The specific aims are: 1) Examine the effectiveness of a 6-month, community-based aerobic exercise program, compared to health education control, on indicators of cognitive function (i.e., cognitive performance, neuroimaging metrics of brain health, self-reported cognitive impairment) in post-menopausal breast cancer survivors; and 2) Gather information on the interventions potential for scalability. Participants will complete a comprehensive battery of cognitive, neural, behavioral, and patient-reported outcomes prior to the intervention, at post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention to address study Aim 1. Participants will be randomized to one of the two groups after all pre-intervention data have been collected. Individuals randomized to the aerobic exercise program will receive a 6-month membership to a community fitness center and an individualized exercise program led by an exercise trainer employed by the fitness center. Individuals randomized to the health education control group will receive one-on-one cancer support and education, and will be offered a 6-month membership to a fitness center at the end of the study. To address study Aim 2, we will evaluate recruitment success, participation rate among area fitness centers and exercise trainers, participant and exercise trainer adherence to the exercise program, continued engagement in physical activity among intervention participants after the program ends, and continuation of the program in the area fitness centers after the program ends. Data gathered from this study will provide important information on aerobic exercise training for improving cognitive function and the potential of a scalable, community-based approach for promoting exercise in breast cancer survivors. If successful, the approach proposed here may have the potential to improve uptake of physical activity among survivors, to be disseminated on a large-scale, and to inform clinical guidelines for treating CRCI.",

This legacy has produced social, health and economic inequalities for Native Americans, and the problem continues due to a complex series of factors that were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Achieving health equity for Native Americans requires epistemological and systemic change. A new way of working together is needed that optimizes how universities and researchers can work in partnership with Native communities to advance tribal sovereignty and self-determination in achieving health equity for Native people. The overarching goal of our proposal is to promote community-centered research approaches that amplify Indigenous ways of knowing, doing, and being through all aspects of the research lifecycle. Through this goal, our intended outcomes include 1) establishing a community of practice via community engagement and co-creation 2) creating a gold standard platform for equitable research partnerships that advance tribal sovereignty and Indigenous self-determination 3) developing an Indigenous Ambassadors, Scholars, and Fellows program 4) hosting a national conference.",
FP00034023,806,,,,,1,,,"Scope of WorkAlzheimer's disease (AD) affects 6.2 million Americans aged 65 or older, with direct costs estimated at $321 billion in 2022. Research suggests that interventions for AD could significantly reduce the prevalence of dementia in the coming decades and generate billions in savings for society. Yet, only one therapeutic, aducanumab, has come to market in nearly two decades. Current evidence supports that AD prevention at the preclinical phase before symptom onset is likely to be the most effective but will require the establishment of sensitive and cost-effective biomarkers to identify high-risk individuals and serve as endpoints for AD randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid, and emerging blood-based biomarkers (BBBM) for AD pathology of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) have significantly advanced the field, they are expensive, invasive, or need additional validation. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has long been embedded in AD RCTs to screen participants and to measure N outcomes (e.g., hippocampal volume). There is a strong research interest in increasing the sMRI utility for RCTs in screening and developing elaborative morphometry techniques for outcome measures. Collaborating with a group of clinical researchers, physicians, and neurologists, the current project aims to develop a series of geometric machine learning methods to integrate deep learning and Bayesian networks for using sMRI (with commonly collected clinical/demographic data) to complement BBBM for brain pathology identification and predict future cognitive decline as RCT screening tools. The proposed interpretable machine learning structure will enable the development of effective univariate biomarkers as RCT outcome measures. We will develop and validate our methods in >10,000 sMRI images (subsets paired with amyloid/tau PET and BBBM) from 8 existing projects to train and validate our methods and examine their comparability for determining eligibility to the screening criteria and measuring outcome responses in 4 completed RCTs, whose populations vary from cognitively unimpaired (CU) (Alzheimers Prevention Initiative-API: PI Reiman; brain-mind intervention-BMI: PI Tang) to mild and moderate AD (fornix deep brain stimulation study-ADvance: Imaging Core PI Smith; aerobic exercise in AD-FIT-AD: PI Yu). Project aims: (1) Develop hierarchical Bayesian networks with our novel Gaussian kernel, which is geometry-aware and embeds with intra-kernel convolution; (2) Develop tetrahedral convolutional neural networks (TCNN) with our new volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator and a hybrid deep learning (DL) + Bayesian networks (BN) geometric learning framework to leverage both DLs feature learning ability and BNs feature aggregation ability. Our proposed interpretable learning models identify imaging biomarkers relating to AD development; (3) Validate the system in longitudinal cohorts and completed RCTs; (4) Develop and disseminate open-source software tools for geometric deep learning and Bayesian networks. The developed open-source software will be designed for easy use in AD clinical trials and adaptable to analyze sMRI data from many other neurodegenerative, neurological, and psychiatric disorders.",

FP00034109,809,,,,,1,,,"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the U.S., serving approximately nine million Veterans each year. In response to concerns about timely access to care for Veterans, Congress passed the VA MISSION Act of 2018. This legislation streamlined the Veterans Community Care Program to give Veterans greater access to non-VHA providers in the community. With an increasing number of community providers joining this program, especially in rural areas, new efforts seek to educate providers on military culture and the unique considerations of providing medical and mental health care for the Veteran population. The military community has a distinct culture and providing a baseline level of training for current and future health care professionals is vital to the development of the patient-provider relationship and quality of care provided to the Veteran. Veterans, current service members, and their families face unique challenges including: re-transitioning to civilian life, finding post-military employment, securing housing, re-adjusting to the isolation from the military unit and the independence associated with civilian life, challenges in joining supportive communities, and restoration or renewal of prior relationships and the establishment of new ones. Additionally, Veterans are at increased risk for experiencing a potential host of physical and mental health-related issues specific to their service, making access to appropriate and coordinated care even more vital. However, these unique and complex care needs are often not adequately addressed by providers outside of the official VA network and thus, community care providers are experiencing many challenges effectively identifying and meeting the needs of their Veteran patients. For example, community providers may not even know to ask new patients if they, or a family member, have ever served potentially missing the opportunity to collect a fuller patient history or connect patients to resources targeting Veterans and their families. To address these gaps in cultural and clinical competencies, Arizona State University (ASU) in partnership with the Phoenix VA Health Care System, has adopted innovative education solutions, specifically Project ECHO, to create a virtual learning network of community providers to build their capacity in treating mental health and medical issues associated with military service.",

FP00034130,811,,,,,1,,,"1.PROJECT BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been especially devastating to adults living with autism spectrum disorder. They have faced isolation from educational and support services and have suffered from higher rates of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 than the general population. During lockdowns and limited in-person business activities, adults with autism were among the first to lose their jobs and, based on history, will be the slowest to regain them. As many as 75% of the 5.6 million adults with autism in the U.S. are unemployed or underemployed, depleting our workforce and negatively affecting businesses in need of qualified, dedicated employees. Amid this crisis, federal programs have underperformed in helping adults with autism. People with disabilities, including intellectual or developmental disabilities, experience poverty at twice the rate of the general population. Further, only 17% of adults with disabilities receive Medicaid funding for long-term support servicesand 75% of those adults live with family members without the support they need to thrive. With one in 44 children in the U.S. diagnosed with autism each yearand more than 70,000 of those young people exiting high school annuallyArizona and the U.S. must scale new models to help adults with autism live more productive, independent and fulfilling lives. Individuals with autism, regardless of IQ and ability, remain highly disadvantaged adults. Meta-analysis of outcomes indicates that less than 20% of autistic individuals have Good outcomes, while 51% have Poor outcomes. We can and must do better for this growing population. Providing opportunities for choice regarding where and with whom to live are crucial to expanding access to independent living options.2.PROJECT GOAL: First Place AZ will support a two-year pilot encompassing supportive housing amenities and digital locker technology for Arizona residents diagnosed with autism and/or intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (I/DD). Further, it is the intent that ASU CHS will evaluate the process, outcomes and impact of selecting and supporting diverse individuals with autism and/or I/DD who meet the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) category of households that have experienced negative economic harm because of COVID-19. The experiences and evaluation data from this study can be used to inform best practices in this area to improve the lives of autistic people and the families in the State of Arizona and beyond.3.PROJECT OUTCOME: First Place AZ will utilize identified evidence-based practices to provide supportive amenities to adults with a diagnosis of autism and/or I/DD.  First Place AZ will share this data, and any other data with ASU CHS to enable ASU CHS to evaluate the outcomes and impact of this approach. Ten (10) Arizona residents diagnosed with autism and/or intellectual/developmental disabilities (I/DD) who meet the ARPA income requirements, will lease consumer-controlled apartments at First Place-Phoenix and be provided supportive housing amenities for up to two years. One hundred (100) individuals will create Kiip user accounts and upload up to five documents. Up to 40 Kiip assistant accounts, from friends and/or family members, will be created to assist neurodiverse adults in collecting, storing, and sharing documents.",

FP00034132,813,,,,,1,,,"It is generally established that the microorganisms in our gut influence human health. As such, obesity has been associated with a less favorable gut microbiota (GM), while exercise has been associated with a more favorable GM. Therefore, we suggest investigating the GM in obese and non-obese athletes and their sedentary counterparts. This will allow us to compare differences in gut flora based on exercise level and body composition, and relate this to their diet and gastrointestinal (GI) health. Such answers are expected to reveal important information currently lacking on the impact of exercise on the GM and body composition. Executive summaryDesign: This study assesses the gut microbiota (GM) diversity and composition, self-reported diet quality, and gastrointestinal (GI) distress in obese and non-obese athletes and their sedentary counterparts.Participants: Healthy Arizona State University (ASU) NCAA Division I non-smoking Football student-athletes and sedentary students without symptoms of chronic disease, intolerance, or allergies will be matched for body fat mass (obese, BMI =27.5 kg/m2 vs. non-obese men, BMI: <27.5 kg/m2, age 18-25 years old), with a total of n=25 participants per group.Procedures: Participants will undergo a body composition assessment (InBody770, InBody USA, Cerritos, CA), provide a fecal swab, and complete a web-based diet quality questionnaire (REAP) and a GI symptoms rating scale (GSRS) covering the previous 7-day period.Analysis: 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing will be used to analyze microbial richness (a-diversity), community composition (-diversity), and taxonomic classification; REAP and GSRS scores will be calculated. Statistics: Differences in continuous clinical outcomes will be assessed with General Linear Models (GLM) and differences in categorical outcomes with logistic regression. All models will adjust for relevant covariates (i.e., body composition, diet quality, foods with high vs. low fiber, and GI complaints). Non-parametric counterparts will be performed when appropriate (i.e., GI symptoms). For the GM analysis, alpha diversity will be compared using the Kruskal-Wallis sum rank test, and beta diversity will be compared with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We will correlate the most abundant taxa with diet quality and GI complaints. Significance will be set at P=0.05 with false discovery rate corrections applied where appropriate.Significance of researchThe novelty of this proposal lies in comparing well-trained high-level collegiate student-athletes with different types of body composition with their sedentary counterparts. Most literature addresses the influence of diet on the gut microbiome 1, but little is known about the influence of exercise.2 Additionally, the GM may play an important role in the development of obesity.3 As obesity in some sports comes with the job (i.e., lineman need to be heavy), this allows us to compare obese vs. non-obese athletes undergoing the same training program, while standardizing most diet options (mutual dining hall options). If GM differences are related to body composition and thus playing position, current dietary recommendations and use of certain sport-specific products consumed by the athlete may be tailored to align with individual digestive capabilities. This will help limit GI dysfunction associated with microbial gut communities, reducing negative overall health consequences.",
FP00034141,814,,,,,1,,,"Method of Approach and Conformance to Scope of Work1.Executive SummaryMany Arizona schools are forced to hire underqualified, inexperience teachers. This critical teacher shortage extends to preschool and prevents equitable access to high quality early childhood education, especially for children from low-income families and those living in rural areas of Arizona. This was a pressing problem before the COVID-19 pandemic and continues today. School closures, open teaching positions, and family health challenges have exacerbated learning loss in all children, including those who had access to preschool prior to the pandemic.Nevertheless, research is clear that high quality preschool programs can have positive, long-lasting benefits for all children. In fact, children from economically disadvantaged families may benefit more from high quality preschool programs than children from higher SES families (Schweinhart, 2013). Therefore, how can we significantly increase the number of high quality preschool programs in Arizona? Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is a promising approach! Through Project ECHO we can provide free, high quality, accessible, evidence-based professional development training to early childhood educators where they work and live.Project ECHO is an innovative online model for improving education and health outcomes https://chs.asu.edu/project-echo. In Project ECHO, we move knowledge, not people. Expert hub teams work with providers in local communities to increase workforce capacity and in turn, the school readiness of children (Figure 1). Project ECHO exponentially increases access to high quality professional development in rural and underserved areas. Importantly, the Project ECHO training model includes training components consistent with adult learning principles that promote translation of research into practice (Figure 2).We formed the Arizona Early Childhood Professional Development Collaborative in 2020 to leverage the expertise of multiple early childhood agencies in Arizona to improve professional development training and access. Our Collaborative is one project under the umbrella of the Language and Literacy Translational Team in the College of Health Solutions at ASU. From 2020-2022, despite the pandemic, we trained more than 300 early childhood providers from 13/15 Arizona counties on seven high priority topics. Participants gave overwhelmingly positive reviews of trainings. We have also initiated pilot research to assess training effectiveness for improving knowledge and implementation of trained practices.Steps to Meet Scope of WorkIn 2023, our Collaborative will provide Project ECHO training to 150 early childhood preschool providers in Arizona in the science of reading. As detailed later in the proposal, training aligns directly with Arizonas Early Learning Standards, the Continuum of Effective Literacy Practices, research recommendations for early literacy teaching, and adult learning principles.Who: Three cohorts of early childhood preschool providers (~ 50 per cohort)When: One cohort each in spring, summer, and fall of 2023 (could be replicated in subsequent years)Schedule: 14 week series for each cohort with 1.5 hour ECHO training sessions per week (scheduling around holidays)SOR Topics: (2 weeks per topic): Language and Print Rich Classrooms; Oral Language; Alphabet Knowledge; Phonological Awareness; Dialogic Reading; Literacy-Based Dramatic Play; Writing and SpellingTrainers: One expert didactic presenter; 5 expert hub team members; 1 student technical support per seriesAssessment: All participants complete pre- and post-training questionnaires for each session and for the series regarding knowledge gained and practices implemented as well as satisfaction with training. All participants have the option to consent to participate in efficacy research with more detailed pre-post measures, including weekly reporting of implementation. Participants completing research receive a $100 research incentive.Certificates:All participants receive a professional development certificate from ASU detailing the training topics and the number of hours of training completed. In addition, with permission, we will enter hours into the Arizona Early Childhood Workforce Registry.The Project ECHO training series begins with a planning document completed by the training team that specifies (a) measurable course goals; (b) measurable training session objectives; (c) assessments; (d) homework and reporting methods; and (e) training materials. The plan for each session also includes training team areas of expertise and affiliations. All team members are encouraged to complete Project ECHO online training through the University of New Mexico.Shelley Gray (Project Lead) has a Ph.D. and is a certified, licensed speech-language pathologist. Karie Taylor (Project ECHO Coordinator) is an early childhood special education teacher with her masters degree. Both have more than 20 years experience working with young children and training students and professionals. All expert didactic presenters will have graduate degrees in education or a closely related field and more than five years in-depth experience with the topics they teach. Hub team presenters will have bachelor degrees or higher in education or a closely related field and a minimum of three years working with young children.Each training session (see Figure 3) follows a similar format, emphasizing participation by everyone. The fast-paced session mixes whole group and small group modelling and discussions. Case-based presentations by volunteers from the community involve the whole team helping to solve problems and cheer successes. This is an effective professional learning community paired with expert support and reflection.  Participants complete homework each week involving implementation of practices they learn in ECHO training sessions.",
FP00034158,815,,,,,1,,,"OverviewParkinsons disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with an annual costof $52 billion in the United States [1]. The number of Americans dying from PD continues to rise, witha 63% growth in the past two decades [2]. With no cure available, therapies to treat motor symptomsinclude dopamine replacement drugs such as levodopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, currenttherapies are used in an open-loop setting where the treatment parameters (e.g., medication timeand dosage; stimulation frequency, pulse width, and amplitude) are preset without being autonomouslyadjusted over time. Because patients experience constant motor fluctuations (i.e., temporal fluctuationsin the degree of benefit from the treatment) the open-loop nature of the treatment results in dangerouscircumstances of under-treatment, leading to falls, injury, and death [3, 4]. To address this problem, wepropose to design a closed-loop system for symptom monitoring and adaptive treatment in people withPD. We will develop and evaluate a cyber physical system that (i) assesses PD symptoms objectively,continuously, and in real-time; (ii) automatically predicts when symptoms are worsening, e.g., off medicationperiods; and (iii) closes the loop by adaptively adjusting the treatment, e.g., recommend initiating nextdose of levodopa on-the-fly based on the patients motor performance. Our proposed human-in-the-loopsystem integrates data, human input, and machine learning for optimal and timely delivery of healthcareimprovements through automatic symptom assessment and autonomous treatment control.Intellectual MeritThis project will create a CPS for personalized and adaptive motor function control by developing algorithmsand tools for efficient data gathering in-the-wild, motor symptom assessment, forecasting of motorfluctuations, and identifying optimal treatment regimens. Intellectually rigorous aspects of the project are: Multi-task interactive learning: we will investigate approaches for efficient gathering and labeling of multimodalwearable sensor data to detect multi-symptom motor function, and to identify optimal treatmentregimens. We will develop optimization algorithms that balance machine learning model accuracy andhuman input (i.e., annotations provided by patient and clinician). Automated health assessment: we will research computational methods for robust analysis of wearablesensor data for multi-modal assessment of PD symptoms and health event classification. We will leveragenew mathematical techniques drawn from functional analysis and topological time-series analysisto reliably compute motor function features in noisy environments. Motor function forecasting: we will develop machine learning models that combine multi-scale and multiresolutiondata about motor function performance, treatment history, and treatment regimen to forecastmotor function and impending off states while providing interpretations about the model predictions. Treatment control: we will develop sequential decision making algorithms that integrate sensor data andclinicians recommended treatment regimens to automate adaptive treatment through imitation learning. Validation: Our team has significant experience in conducting in-field studies for technology evaluation.We will assess the performance of the proposed system in a two-phase user study focused on symptommonitoring and levodopa control involving people with PD in naturalistic settings.Broader ImpactsThis research will not only address the technical challenges in building systems for accurate monitoringand adaptive treatment, but will also enable actual management of many health conditions. The projecthas major impacts on high-precision interventions and on availability of consumer applications. It will leadto the development of products, services, and businesses around the concept of mixed initiative medicalcyber physical systems. The proposed interdisciplinary research, which spans computing, engineering,and health, will advance discovery while promoting teaching and learning. The PIs will integrate researchactivities into interdisciplinary courses and summer-school events held annually. Our outreach activitieswill focus on underrepresented community college students and people with Parkinsons disease in thegreater Phoenix area. Building on their past success, the PIs will involve graduate and undergraduatestudents, including female students and underrepresented minorities, in research.Keywords: data analytics and machine learning, health, mixed initiatives",
FP00034321,816,,,,,1,,,"Background: In 2020, about 14 million U.S households experienced food insecurity (FI)-a critical social determinant of health that has been associated with sub-optimal health outcomes. About 35% of households with annual income below the poverty level experienced FI in 2020 compared to 7% among those with incomes at or above 185 percent of the poverty level. About 22% of households with a Black household head experienced food insecurity compared to 7% among households with a White household head. About 54 million U.S residents were projected to experience food insecurity due to the pandemic.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest safety-net program that targets food insecurity in the United States, reduces food insecurity and poverty and improves health outcomes among participants. The importance of SNAP is highlighted by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) which was enacted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. FFCRA leveraged SNAP to address increased FI due to the pandemic.Continuous SNAP enrollment is necessary for the optimal impact of SNAP on food insecurity, poverty, and health to be achieved. The routine recertification required to maintain SNAP participation results in administrative burdens that sometimes lead to SNAP disenrollment among eligible individuals. To reduce recertification burden, some states have implemented interventions such as electronic access to applications and special assistance by SNAP administrators. For such interventions to result in equitable impact, there is a need to identify whether there is an association between stable SNAP participation and population-level factors.Objective: To use the 2014-2021 North Carolina and South Carolina data to analyze the relationship between stable SNAP participation and population-level factors (food deserts, rural/urban residence, residential segregation).Specific Aims: To determine: 1) trends in SNAP participation patterns (2014-2021; 2) the relationship between population-level factors and measures of stable SNAP participation before the COVID-19 pandemic; 3) the association between population-level factors and stable SNAP participation during the pandemic. For each aim, we will also determine any difference between White and Black clients. Stable SNAP participation will be measured over a 12-month period and will include: 1) number of months on SNAP; 2) churning-exit and re-entry into SNAP within four months (yes, no) and 3) participation pattern (continuous vs discontinued/intermittent).",
FP00034360,817,,,,,1,,,"Speaker Embeddings via Federated Learning for Enforcing Fairness in Automatic Speaker Recognition Across Diverse GroupsPI: Suren Jayasuriya, Assistant Professor, School of Electrical Computer and Energy Engineering & Arts, Media and Engineering, Arizona State UniversityCo-PI: Visar Berisha, Associate Professor, School of Electrical Computer and Energy Engineering, and Speech and Hearing Science, Arizona State University Cash funding needed: $80,000AWS Promotional Credits needed: $20,000Amazon contact: Dr. John McKay, jomcky@amazon.comAbstract  Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are ubiquitous in modern applications from human-computer interfaces to speech-to-text conversion to voice identification. State-of-the-art ASR leverages advanced neural network architectures trained on large corpora of speech data. However, ASR performance is primarily biased towards white, European-centric speakers who form the largest demographic of speakers in these public datasets. ASR performance is degraded significantly for minority groups including Black, Hispanic/Latino, and individuals with disability. In this project, methods for improving fairness and mitigating bias for ASR will be developed that leverage statistical techniques to help performance for groups with protected attributes. In particular, we develop new learning-based embeddings which capture salient information about the speaker while enforcing fairness constraints, trained on data collected from a wide, diverse set of speakers. These embeddings will be constructed in a federated learning framework to protect the privacy of clients data while improving performance metrics. This research will enable new ways to analyze demographic parity for ASR as well as computational methods to help mitigate bias and preserve privacy. Keywords  automatic speech recognition, federated learning, speech embeddings, demographic parityIntroduction Automated speech recognition (ASR) systems utilize state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for converting speech to text, and are widely used for virtual assistants, closed captioning, and digital dictation platforms, particularly for human-computer interfaces. The rise of publicly available datasets has enabled large deep learning networks to be trained for ASR. However, there is significant concern that speech recognition systems suffer from racial/demographic bias due to the diversity of these training datasets. A recent study across five commercial ASR systems from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft was shown to produce an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers as opposed to 0.19 for white speakers [1]; other studies have shown WERs higher than 0.5 for many speakers with speech impairments [2]. Similar results are hypothesized for other groups such as Hispanic/Latino, non-European speakers. It is clear that existing ASR systems can lead to large inequities and disparities for different users from these groups, which can affect the end performance or user interaction for the technologies and services that utilize ASR. In addition to demographic bias, there are needs to preserve the privacy of speech data that is being collected on the client side, while simultaneously improving ASR on-device deployment. Recently, federated learning [3] has enabled privacy-preserving training of machine learning models by decentralizing the training process. Multiple clients (typically edge devices) communicate with a centralized server to collaboratively train the weights of a deep learning model without sharing their personal data. Recent work has also investigated the use of federated learning to preserve statistical fairness metrics [4]. Federated learning has also been shown to work effectively for ASR [5] with preserving edge performance similar to a server-based model. However, there has not been significant work on mitigating bias for demographic groups for ASR in a federated learning framework. In this project, we aim to computationally address automatic speaker recognition (ASR) to mitigate bias for demographic groups. In particular, we are interested in speakers with non-typical or different vernacular and dialect, or individuals who suffer from speech impairment or disorders, and for whom conventional ASR systems have not been designed in mind for. The proposed research needs to solve several challenges including (1) designing speaker embeddings and feature learning that boosts the performance of downstream ASR tasks, (2) ensure that bias is mitigated and there is fairness across demographic groups, and (3) accomplish these tasks in federated learning setting to preserve privacy. To do this, we introduce new learning-based speech embedding methods and leverage constraints for fairness for the ASR downstream task. Further, we propose an extensive study of the effect of different protected attributes for ASR in a federated learning framework, and leverage a wide, diverse set of speaker data to help study fairness in this context. Strength of PIs: This research team consists of two PIs who have complementary expertise in speech/audio and machine learning. PI Suren Jayasuriya is an assistant professor in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering & the School of Arts, Media and Engineering, with expertise in machine learning applied to computer vision, image and audio signal processing. Related to this project, his two graduate students Jianwei Zhang and Albert Reed have conducted internships in the Amazon Alexa AI team working on machine learning for natural language processing and information retrieval problems. Co-PI Visar Berisha is an associate professor with a joint appointment in the College of Health Solutions (Speech and Hearing Science) and the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering. The overarching goal of his research is to develop and apply new machine learning and statistical signal processing tools to better understand and model signal perception. With a focus on speech, the goal is to develop reliable, data-driven models that can mimic aspects of human cognition.Methods We propose two main thrusts for our research study, namely the development of a state-of-the-art speech embedding algorithms that can work in a federated learning setting, studying bias and fairness of utilizing these embeddings for ASR on a large corpus of speech data, and enforcing constraints to help improve performance with respect to underrepresented demographic groups in the dataset. The first thrust will evaluate the speaker embedding algorithm on several datasets to investigate representational bias for groups such as Black and Hispanic/Latino speakers, age (especially the elderly), and individuals with impaired speech. The second thrust will seek to improve performance of the method with respect to these demographic groups, namely by performing statistical optimizations and resampling strategies to mitigate bias in the ASRs results.  Thrust 1: Evaluating the performance of speaker embeddings for different demographics via federated learningAn embedding is a relatively low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional input. Ideally, embeddings capture meaningful characteristics of the input data; and embeddings generated from data that are similar in those meaningful characteristics, are located close together in the embedding space. Good embeddings can be learned once and then reused across different datasets and models. Foundation models in natural language processing (e.g. BERT, GPT-3, etc.) are good examples of this. However, it is not known how these embeddings encapsulate the speech differences for a diverse set of speakers, particularly those underrepresented in publicly available datasets. Prior work: Recently, both the PI and co-PI have successfully collaborated to design an embedding model for dysphonic voice detection (approximately 1.2% of the worlds population has impaired (dysphonic) voice production). Our framework, which contains one encoder and one MLP classifier, is jointly trained by a combined loss based on contrastive and classification loss. Data warping methods are used on the input samples to improve the robustness of our method. For the task of distinguishing the dysphonic and healthy voices, our method not only achieves good in-corpus and cross-corpus classification accuracy, but also learns consistent voice embeddings across different corpora. Please refer to our preprint [6] for more details.Figure 1: Prior work by the PIs to develop feature-based speech embeddings for impaired (dysphonic) vocal quality [6].Figure 1: Prior work by the PIs to develop feature-based speech embeddings for impaired (dysphonic) vocal quality [6].Proposed work: While our team has made considerable progress in speaker embeddings for a particular health application, there remains a large effort to help ensure this method enables fair ASR performance in downstream applications. In particular, we aim to show that diffusion-based models, coupled with fairness and bias constraints, can help overcome disparities in ASR performance. To realize this in the first thrust, we will conduct a large study to test the performance of an ASR pipeline for various speaker demographics. The results of this study will then help inform Thrust 2 where various fairness constraints will be leveraged. To perform our study, we will collect a large corpus of data by combining several existing datasets for speakers including: (1) the Mozilla common voice English dataset for the cross-corpus evaluation [7]; (2) Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) [8]; and (3) a dataset of over 100 individuals with impaired speech due to neurological disease (a subset of this sample was used in [9].)We will conduct studies to evaluate ASR algorithms on a distribution of data where the data is balanced within demographic groups as well as when the dataset is unbalanced to report any bias that emerges. In particular, we are interested in federated learning where the model must be trained in a decentralized fashion. Common algorithms such as FedAvg [10] and agnostic federated learning (AFL) [11] perform averaging/ensembling over the distributed models being trained at the client side. However, these algorithms will likely not work in the presence of bias in the dataset, and result in worse performance for certain underrepresented demographic groups. We will conduct an evaluation of our speaker embeddings trained in a distributed, federated fashion to see if this bias shows up in this context. Figure 2: Feature normalization method to help provide interpretability for ASR performance with respect to protected attributes within the populationFigure 2: Feature normalization method to help provide interpretability for ASR performance with respect to protected attributes within the populationWe are particularly concerned with testing for the effects of representational bias [12] in these datasets. One way to test bias is to observe how the speech embeddings that are learned vary across different groups. We propose a procedure, described in Figure 2, to normalize the features based on a cumulative distribution function (CDF) computed from within a demographic group. This will help determine what features are correlated with prediction outcomes and help interpret differing ASR performance. We also will conduct ablative studies for various forms of lossy speech transformations such as noise, compression, and background to study how any disparities in performance get exacerbated by the non-idealities of real-world environments where the speech is recorded. Thrust 2: Enforcing fairness constraints for demographic parity in ASRBased on our results from Thrust 1, we will then proceed to consider constraints in our training procedure for enforcing fairness and mitigating representation bias for various subgroups within the population. In this project, we undertake a common definition of fairness as the absence of any prejudice or favoritism towards an individual or a group based on their intrinsic or acquired traits in the context of (algorithmic) decision-making [12]. In particular, we are concerned with ensuring demographic or statistical parity for our methods and will use common metric such as statistical parity difference (SPD) and equality of opportunity difference (EOPD) for benchmarking. Below, we list several techniques we will explore to determine which method trains our embeddings to perform the best.Strategic sampling and data augmentation: The simplest approach is to strategically sample with replacement to make the training data look balanced with respect to the sub-group frequencies in the data. We will conduct this sampling across client datasets for federated learning and investigate how to account for different imbalance and non i.i.d. data that occurs in this setting. We will sample rare examples more often during training, or, equivalently, utilize non-uniform misclassification cost for ASR to weight underrepresented groups higher in training. This strategy is nave and we expect it to serve as a baseline for the other methods listed next. In addition, we will leverage our previous work on speech sample augmentation strategies that artificially simulate data from the protected group to balance training data [15]. Adversarial training for fairness through blindness: Our next strategy will attempt to achieve fairness through blindness by not allowing the model to look at, or specifically encode, information about a protected variable, then it cannot be biased. To achieve this, an adversarial network will be constructed to modify embedding features (based on our feature CDFs computed earlier) to try and ensure the network does not rely on the statistics of the majority group too much in training. This will be achieved through a minimax objective: maximize the classifiers ability to predict the class, while minimizing the adversarys ability to predict the protected variable based on the underlying learned features. Furthermore, we will ensure that these embeddings are trained on the client side, and thus no private information is shared with the main server. One challenge to this approach is to look for redundant encodings, where demographic information can leak into the signal (e.g. vernacular or dialect can be encoded into pitch and pronunciation scores), which may provide a threat model for the federated learning that can be exploited.   Reducing bias amplification for fairness through awareness: The alternative to fairness through blindness is fairness through awareness [13] where domain information is explicitly encoded and mitigated. Similar to the approach by [16, 17], we will leverage corpus information to help encode parity among demographic groups while training our methods. Let the classifier output a joint probability P(Y, A | X)  for target class Y , domain attribute A, and input X. We reduce bias amplification by optimizing functions similar to the following:, which removes correlations at test-time for our method. We will implement this optimization to improve demographic parity. Expected results Our timeline for the year is the following: Q1  setup embedding learning algorithms and automatic speaker recognition algorithms as well as benchmarks and metrics for evaluations. Q2  Gather relevant datasets and conduct evaluative study on federated learning in this context. Prepare public release of this dataset with reproducible software environments and benchmarks. Q3  conduct embedding normalization and conditioning experiments on dataset and start to implement fairness strategies. Q4  complete research on fairness strategies, and report on final results in a conference publication. We will opensource our software algorithms via Github with Docker environments for ease of reproducibility.

FP00034414,819,,,,,1,,,"Project title: Uncovering reasons for Native Americans experiencing 8-fold higher mortality than Whites from                     gallbladder cancer (GbCa): A pilot study in Maricopa County, ArizonaMayo Principal Investigator: Ping Yang, M.D., Ph.D., QHS/Cancer Epidemiology; Mayo Clinic Arizona (MCA)ASU Principal Investigator:  Valentin Dinu; College of Health Solutions; Arizona State UniversityBackground, Hypothesis, and Rationale. Gallbladder cancer (GbCa), the most frequent malignancy of the biliary tract, presents the most striking racial disparity among all cancers, where incidence and mortality are 6- to 8-fold, respectively, higher in American Indians and Alaskan Native (AIAN) people than in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Top two prominent risk factors for GbCa are gallstones (with or without symptoms), which present in ~80% of GbCa patients, and diabetes mellites (DM), which is most prevalent in AIAN among all U.S. populations. We hypothesize that the appalling racial disparity in GbCa mortality is partly due to delays in early diagnosis and effective treatment of GbCa as well as the pre-existing conditions, namely, gallstone disease (GSD) and/or DM. Because all these three diseases mentioned above are well-documented in hospital discharge records, we propose to acquire and analyze Arizona State medicaid program data (2008-2021) to test our research hypothesis.    Aims. This pilot project is designed to explore and establish a feasible method for testing our hypothesis that delays in diagnosis and treatment significantly contribute to the racial disparity in GbCa mortality. Specifically, our primary aims are to investigate (Aim-1) whether the intervals between diagnosis and treatment of  GSD, DM, and GbCa differ among AIAN, NHW, and Hispanic White (HW) patients, HW patients serve as another comparison group; (Aim-2) in GbCa patients, whether the intervals between diagnosis of GSD or DM and treatment of GbCa differ among AIAN, NHW, and HW patients; and (Aim-3) whether types of GbCa treatment differ among AIAN, NHW, and HW patients. Our secondary aims are to explore (Aim-4) whether the patterns observed in Aims 1-3 apply to other areas in AZ beyond Maricopa Co., particularly counties with higher AIAN and HW people; and (Aim-5) whether target hospitals and communities can be identity for next-step engagement to further investigate barriers that contribute to the observed disparities. Abbreviated Methods. We will acquire and analyze data from all de-identified GbCa patients from three racial/ethnic populations, i.e., AIAN, NHW, and HW, utilizing claims and encounter data resided in Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS). AHCCCS is the state agency that administers Arizonas Medicaid program, covers the behavioral and physical health care services for approximately 2 million Arizonans. All Arizona licensed hospitals, regardless of license type, are required to report inpatient and emergency department discharge records to the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS). We will take advantage of existing Mayo Clinics partnership with Center for Health Information Research (CHiR) at Arizona State University (ASU), which is the source for all processing of the AHCCCS data. We will also utilize and analyze existing data resource from a Maricopa County based Latinx community. Planned analyses include, not limited to, case-control comparisons of selected risk factors, e.g., history of other diseases/conditions, time of treatment of GSD and/or DM before diagnosis/treatment of GbCa, basic clinical information, e.g., age, sex, GbCa stage, initial treatment type, time between initial diagnosis and initial treatment, and time between initial treatment and death (i.e., survival time); and if available, other risk factors and epidemiological characteristics, e.g., smoking/drinking history, personal and family history of gallbladder and other diseases). Noted, we do not need to know patient-level information; we will only generate aggregated tables; and we may modify the list of risk factors based on accessible databases and available information. Three limitations are (1) only medicaid patients who enrolled in AHCCCS program are included; (2) patients medical history recorded outside of the AHCCCS system will not be captured; and (3) asymptomatic gallstone, which were incidentally found, will be underestimated.Potential Impact, Future Plans, and Relevance/Potential Benefit. This hypothesis-driven pilot project aims to expand scientific expertise in GbCa early diagnosis and optimal therapy in the context of racial disparities. Meanwhile, focusing on MCCCs catchment area at Arizona campus, we may identity target hospitals and communities for next-step engagement to further investigate barriers that contribute to the observed disparities. If our hypothesis supported by results from this study, discovery of novel prevention strategies will be perused leveraging the methods and models developed, which will be the basis for extramural funding applications and peer-reviewed publications. Our optimal goal is to provide evidence for an innovative strategy to early detect and effectively intervene the modifiable risk factors to reduce GbCa mortality. Moreover, the resources, infrastructure, and informatics methods established herein can be feasibly adapted to other cancer sites.",
FP00034418,820,,,,,1,,,"Title: The interplay of SNAP and WIC participation: Does it affect nutritional quality of household food purchases?Sponsor: Robert Wood Johnson FoundationCollaborating Sponsor: NORC at the University of ChicagoStart date: December 2022Duration: 18 monthsSCOPE OF WORKIn the proposed project, we will examine the healthfulness of household retail food purchases by households eligible for two of the major federal food assistance programs, namely the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). We will calculate the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015) on households food purchases and compare it for four different types of households: participating in SNAP only, WIC only, both SNAP and WIC, or neither program. Our secondary goal is to assess area-level moderating factors; for instance, whether the differences in HEI-2015 across different types of households are uniform or different across area of residence (e.g., rural vs urban; or low vs adequate access to healthy food stores). To accomplish this, we will use 5 different dataset, two that are restricted to public use, and three that are publicly available. For the restricted-use data, we will obtain access by the USDA if the grant is funded. Examining interactions between SNAP and WIC can reveal potential complementarities between them, which can motivate policymakers to: (1) simplify disparate enrollment procedures to maximize participation of eligible households in social safety net programs, and (2) streamline nutrition-focused messages across similar and allied programs.",

This means that our college coordinates all ECHOs run by Arizona State University. Our college prioritizes community-based training; thus, faculty are allowed to provide training through Project ECHO as part of their service to the college. This covers the basic operational costs of Project ECHO. However, the capacity to conduct research is not covered by faculty service nor are the staff hours required to conduct research studies. Therefore, we seek funding to cover the costs of planned efficacy research.                                                             rev. 2/2/21 6  Section 2: Aims, BEF Mission, Collaboration, Dissemination, Potential Impact 1. Specific Aims/Scope of Work.  In one or two sentences, state the Specific Aims of this proposed evaluation project. What are the goals of the specific project being proposed in this application? (max. 600 characters with spaces, about 100 words) 1. Test the efficacy of Project ECHO professional development (PD) for improving preschool teacher's knowledge and implementation of high quality instructional practices to improve children's oral language and early literacy skills. 2. Determine whether children enrolled in Project ECHO classrooms demonstrate greater gains in oral language and early literacy skills than children enrolled in comparison classrooms. 3. Determine whether teacher level variables (e.g. PD participation, responses to the Preschool Teacher Literacy Beliefs Questionnaire moderate teacher or child outcomes.     2. Fit with Mission.  The mission of the Brady Education Foundation is to fund projects that seek to close the opportunity and resulting achievement gaps associated with race and family income. Provide a brief explanation of how this project is consistent with this mission. (max. 600 characters with spaces, about 100 words) Neighborhood poverty is related to lower classroom quality. Children in lower quality classrooms demonstrate lower gains in oral language, early literacy, and social-emotional skills than their peers in higher income neighborhoods. High quality preschool experiences can provide a buffer against poor cognitive, language, and social outcomes for children from economically disadvantaged homes; however, teachers from low income areas typically lack access to high quality professional development shown to raise instructional quality. Project ECHO provides this access for free.  3. Collaboration.  Briefly describe how researchers (i.e., the Principal Investigator and other researchers conducting the evaluation), practitioners (i.e., program personnel), and community stakeholders (if applicable), have collaborated thus far and will continue to collaborate to conduct this evaluation. Please consider each phase of the evaluation as applicable (i.e., formulation of questions and study design, recruitment, data collection, interpretation of findings, dissemination). (max. 1,500 characters with spaces, about 250 words) We formed the Arizona Early Childhood Professional Development Collaborative in 2020 to leverage the expertise of multiple early childhood agencies (>12) to improve professional development training and access for Arizona's early childhood educators. From 2020-2022, despite the pandemic, we trained more than 400 early childhood providers in 13/15 Arizona counties on seven high priority topics. We collected pilot efficacy data and participants gave overwhelmingly positive reviews of trainings. In the proposed study, our Collaborative continues their work (Co-PIs Gray and Soto-Boykin, Co-I Seltzer, Project Manager Taylor) with Arizona State University leading the evaluation study (design, research questions, data analyses, budget administration, IRB) and our AZ PD Collaborative supporting recruitment and training. rev. 2/2/21 7  4. Dissemination. Briefly describe how the findings from this project will be disseminated to:  a) the research community (e.g., peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, etc.) (max. 600 characters with spaces, about 100 words)  We will disseminate research results by (a) preregistering our study on the Open Science Framework, (b) presenting results at research conferences; (c) publishing results in peer-reviewed journals; and (d) sharing deidentified data on the Open Science Framework. b) the practice community (e.g., conference presentations, submissions to listings such as the What Works Clearing House at the Institute of Education Sciences, etc.) (max. 600 characters with spaces, about 100 words)  We will disseminate findings to the community by (a) preparing community briefs that translate findings into lay terms for dissemination to all of our trainees, their organizations, and our Collaborative partners; (b) conducting a 'community-partnered research conference' for all Project ECHO participants and their communities at the end of the project to disseminate findings and to plan future projects; (c) updating the Project ECHO community website with ongoing information about the evaluation study; and (d) submit our work to sites such as the WWC; social media, blogs, and podcasts. c) policy makers, if applicable (may be at local, state, or national level) (max. 600 characters with spaces, about 100 words)  We will disseminate community briefs to local (e.g. school boards, city councils, tribal councils), state (Superintendant of Public Education, Govenor's Office, AZ Dept. of Education), and national policy maker and organizations (Project ECHO, professional organizations, senators and representatives, educational foundations).

We will share results with these Centers for further policy dissemination.   5. Potential Impact. Briefly describe how the results of this project have the potential to inform private funding decisions and/or public policy. In your reply, if you are aware of and/or currently working with any current or potential funders of the program, public (e.g., public school system) or private (e.g., foundation), that will be interested in the results from this evaluation, please identify and describe your relationship with each organization. (max. 1,500 characters with spaces, about 250 words) Results from this efficacy trial have the potential to increase both public and private support for the Project ECHO training model in early childhood settings. The overarching goal of Project ECHO is to empower local communities to access expert knowledge wherever they live. There are dozens of published articles on the benefits of Project ECHO; however, research to date relies almost exclusively on pre- to post-training gains in knowledge and self-reported implementation practices. rev. 2/2/21 8 Overall, studies have not utilized causally interpretable research designs or collected independent measures of implementation. The proposed study would increase the level of evidence supporting Project ECHO by implementing a randomized controlled trial using independent measures of classroom instructional quality. Our research team has years of experience conducting this type of study. If results indicate that Project ECHO is efficatious at such a low cost, it will be of great interest to school systems, early childhood businesses and vendors, states, families, and professional organizations. Presently our Collaborative has received internal funding from Arizona State University and administrative support from the Arizona Association for the Education of Young Children (AZAEYC). AZAEYC has a representatives in our AZ Early Childhood PD Collaborative.   rev. 2/2/21 9 Section 3: Rationale for Evaluation and Program Information 1. Literature Review.  the need for the program to be evaluated, and  the need for this specific proposed evaluation of this program.  a) Provide a review of the literature that supports: (max. 9,000 characters with spaces, about 1,500 words)   Need for the Program National assessment results indicate a sustained and persistent achievement gap in the reading skills of children from more- versus less-advantaged backgrounds (National Center for Education Statistics, NCES, 2019). In fact, the percentage of children in a school who live in poverty is the single best predictor of standardized reading comprehension scores at all grade levels (Ransdell, 2012). As a group, children from economically disadvantaged households start school with lower language skills (Dickinson, 2011; Hanson et al., 2011), poorer phonological sensitivity (Raz & Bryant, 1990), and poorer print concepts than their more-advantaged peers (Smith & Dixon, 1995). We know that inequality in early childhood experiences and learning produces inequality in abiilty, achievement, health, and adult success (Heckman, 2011, p. 32). Therefore, preschoolers from economically disadvantaged families require high-quality instruction in oral language and early literacy to close the achievement gap between them and their more advantaged peers by kindergarten entry.  Provision of high-quality preschool programs for children from families living in poverty is a national priority, predicated on a growing body of evidence demonstrating that preschool can have positive, long-lasting benefits for all children. Further, children from economically disadvantaged families may benefit more from high quality preschool programs than children from higher SES families (Schweinhart, 2013).  High quality preschool experiences can provide a buffer against poor cognitive, language, and social outcomes for children from economically disadvantaged homes (Dearing et al., 2009); however, most children attend child care centers of average or poor quality (Tietze et al., 2013; Vermeer, van Ijzendoorn, Carcamo, & Harrison, 2016). There is ample evidence that neighborhood poverty is related to lower classroom quality and children enrolled in lower quality classrooms demonstrate fewer gains in early literacy and math skills and poorer social-emotional outcomes than their peers enrolled in classrooms in higher income neighborhoods (McCoy, Connors, Morris, Yoshikawa, & Friedman-Krauss, 2015).   Fortunately, high-quality, accessible professional development offers a pathway for increasing early childhood classroom quality (Egert, Fukkink, & Eckhardt, 2018) when preservice preparation may not (Pianta, Barnett, Burchinal, & Thornburg, 2009). PD and coaching have been shown to improve teachers language and early literacy instructional practices (Burchinal, Vandergrift, Pianta, & Mashburn, 2010; Sheridan, Edwards, Marvin, & Knoche, rev. 2/2/21 10  2009). Unfortunately, there is limited access to effective PD and teacher satisfaction with PD experiences can be low (Garcia & Weiss, 2019).   Taken together there is a well-established research base showing need for closing educational opportunity gaps associated with race, ethnicity, and family income. High-quality preschool programs can help close these gaps. Project ECHO offers a promising solution for increasing early childhood program quality. We know that effective PD helps teachers to (a) do their jobs more effectively (b) stay in their teaching position longer, (c) increase job satisfaction, and (d) improve instruction; but this requires a strong learning community (Garcia & Weiss, 2019). Early childhood educators living in rural and underserved areas lack access to these learning communities and to experts in their field.  Project ECHO exponentially increases access by connecting expert hub teams to providers in local communities. The hub team and local community members form a learning community to increase knowledge and skill implementation, to problem solve, and to support each other. Importantly, there is never a charge for Project ECHO PD training.  Theory of Change Our approach to PD training and measurement is guided by our theory of change. We proposed that Project ECHO PD training will build teacher knowledge, increase reflective discussions about evidence-based oral language and early literacy instructional practices, and motivate teachers to implement learned practices. This will result in proximal teacher effects including increased use and quality of oral language and early literacy teaching practices and an increased quality of oral language use and early literacy skills in classroom environments. These increases will lead to proximal child effects including an increase in code-related skills (phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, print concepts, writing) and an increase in oral language skills (vocabulary and sentence complexity, in conversational turns). We propose that teacher variables (education level, teacher beliefs, quality of baseline instructional practices, participation in PD training sessions) may mediate these outcomes.  Need for the Proposed Evaluation We need a well-designed study of Project ECHO to demonstrate its efficacy across training multiple teams and early childhood educators. The Project ECHO model has already increased access to PD training for thousands of educational and health care professionals around the world and has done so with low programmatic costs and no cost to trainees. The feasibility of this training model is established, internationally and locally by our AZ Early Childhood PD Collaborative. However, research to date on Project ECHO has been limited to non-causal research designs and has relied heavily on self-reported measures of knowledge and practice implementation. The proposed study would test the efficacy of Project ECHO using a causal design and direct proximal measures of rev. 2/2/21 11  teacher knowledge, implementation of taught practices, and child gains in oral language and early literacy. With positive results in hand, the likelihood of securing funding for a larger scale-up efficacy study is more probable. b) References for literature review.

In particular, we intend to reach teachers who often have very limited access to high quality professional development training. b) History. Include as applicable: (max 3,000 characters with spaces, about 500 words)   Where and in what year was the original program developed?   Where has the program been implemented since it was developed?   Has it been modified since its original development, and if so, how?   Where is the program currently being implemented?   How long has the program been implemented in the setting(s) in which this evaluation would take place? *The Arizona Early Childhood Professional Development Collaborative was formed in 2020 in Arizona. *The program has been implemented all over the state of Arizona, reaching early childhood educators in 13/15 Arizona counties.  *The recruitment activities for Project ECHO trainings continue to be modified by adding more and more agencies from around Arizona to our mailing and dissemination lists. We also find that past trainees return for different topics and pass the word on to their colleagues. We have also learned a great deal about how much material we can cover in one training series and expect participants to actually implement. Thus, we've fine tuned our training series to take this into consideration. *Project ECHO itself is implemented around the world. Our Project ECHO trainings are implemented with educators throughout the state of Arizona. *Project ECHOs implemented by the Arizona Early Childhood Professional Development Collaborative have been implemented since early 2020 and are ongoing.

Children would range in age from 4-5 in their prekindergarten year of preschool. d) Duration/intensity of program participation for individuals who complete the full program (e.g., 60 minutes classes, once a week, for a total of 3 months). (max. 150 characters with spaces, about 25 words) 90 min trainings every other week (16 sessions over32 weeks total) plus three small group coaching/feedback sessions 60 min each during the 32 weeks.  e) What are the intended goals and desired outcomes of the program? (max. 1,500 characters with spaces, about 250 words) The overall goal of our Project ECHO trainings is to increase young children's school readiness and success by closing opportunity gaps and dismantling systemic racism in early learning settings in Arizona. The desired outcomes are to (1) increase the quality of early childhood education programs in marginalized communities to rev. 2/2/21 14  include a focus on providing positive and fair learning experiences for all children; (2) train preschool teachers to provide tailored, effective oral language and early literacy learning experiences for children; and (3) close disparities in preschool child outcomes within Arizona focused on oral language and early literacy skill attainment. f) What types of activities do participants engage in to achieve the goals and desired outcomes of the program? (max. 3,000 characters with spaces, about 500 words) Participants engage in five different types of learning and practice activities as part of each Project ECHO training session. The order of these activities may vary. 1. Present and listen to cases presented by their peers directly related to training topics and completion of their homework assignment from the previous training session. For example, two different teachers may show pictures or videos of children engaged in play and conversation at an indoor dramatic play center. Each would explain the challenges they faced incorporating talk and print into the centers (and thus would like help from others) and would also explain what went well and how they plan to apply new practices in the future. 2. Listen to a brief didactic training (10-15 minutes) on a topic presented by an expert in the field. This expert is typically part of the hub team that attends each Project ECHO session. Participants and other hub team members ask questions of the didactic presenter. The presenter also makes resource materials available to participants through the Canvas course shell. 3. Make a plan for homework completion. After the didactic session participants receive their homework assignment (directly related to modelling in the didactic session) to complete over the next two ",
FP00034455,822,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have published over one hundred thousand research articles and made available over eight hundred thousand virus genome sequences. These sequences, along with their metadata, can be used to understand virus evolution and spread and their implications for public health, a field of study called genomic epidemiology. However, these sequence records do not typically contain patient metadata such as demographics, clinical severity, or comorbidities, preventing researchers from uncovering trends in population health. To understand the severity of the problem, we analyzed nearly 748 thousand SARS-CoV-2 records from GISAID and 60 thousand from GenBank for the presence of patient metadata finding age and gender were represented in < 1% of GenBank records and in GISAID, 26% included sex, and 24% had age. For other fields, the amount of missing data is even more pronounced, with neither resource providing information on a patients race and only GISAID specifying severity (i.e. ICU) in less than 5% of records. To address missing virus metadata, researchers could utilize the publication associated with the new sequences, however, the virus sequence record is often never updated with a link to the publication. From the set of records that we analyzed, 3.4% (of 748K) in GISAID and < 1% (of 117K) in GenBank had a link to a publication. This greatly hinders secondary data analysis of these sequences and limits the ability to use them at scale to uncover associations between the viral genome, transmission risk, and health outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to enhance genomic epidemiology and population health of COVID-19 with a framework to continuously and automatically enrich SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid sequence metadata in public databases such as GenBank and GISAID with metadata in associated published articles. We will incorporate input from clinicians at the front-line of patient care during the pandemic and build on our NIH funded work (R01AI117011), which used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enrich the geographic metadata of a sequence record using its corresponding published article. We have used these data in virus phylogeographic models and shown the benefit of using enriched metadata for modeling virus evolution and spread. The availability of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, paired with full text COVID-19 articles and preprints, presents an opportunity for metadata enrichment and scientific discovery beyond our prior work. Our specific aims are to: (1) enrich SARS-CoV-2 sequence metadata using text extracted from publications and (2) derive key epidemiologic insights for different patient demographics using our enriched SARS-CoV-2 sequence dataset. We will leverage our prior joint work funded by the NIH to enable the secondary use of enriched metadata for genomic epidemiology to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and spread among different population groups. We will disseminate the enriched data through our GeoBoost2 data dashboard, GenBank LinkOut and the i2b2 platform.  ",
FP00034477,823,,,,,1,,,"A.1.  Specific Aims  We  propose  a  two-year  collaborative  project  to  synchronize  data  harmonization  efforts  and  analyses  of individual-level  data  in  immunocompromised  populations  to  assess  effectiveness  of  vaccine  boosters  and immune responses using data from 11 Serological Sciences Network (SeroNet) institutions. Our goal is to inform public health guidelines on COVID-19 vaccine and boosters to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness in  these  vulnerable  populations.  To  do  so  requires  large  datasets  of  well-defined  populations  with  clinical information and a robust collaborative infrastructure able to evolve as new research questions arise during the pandemic. Therefore, we propose to mimic the NA-ACCORD strategy of pooling cohorts at multiple sites in North America  (https://naaccord.org).  The  foundational  work  of  the  NA-ACCORD  enabled  them  to  rapidly  pivot  to establish the CIVET-II cohort collaboration during the pandemic. To be time- and cost-efficient, we propose a single pooling project that merges data from both (i) electronic medical records as well as (ii) prospective cohorts from SeroNet sites across the U.S. The cooperation of many SeroNet sites is crucial and will allow results to be more generalizable to the wider U.S. population, including investigation of sources of heterogeneity (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity and geography). Data harmonization efforts will be streamlined, and analyses will be divided by research area across all sites to allow multiple publications to occur simultaneously. The Specific Aims are:   Aim 1: To conduct real-world data (RWD) analyses using electronic medical record (EMR)-data from four health care systems across the U.S. (Kaiser Permanente, Feinstein (FIMR)-Northwell, Veterans Affairs-Case Western and Cedars-Sinai) to determine: Aim  1a:  Vaccine  effectiveness  for  prevention  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection,  severe  COVID-19  and  post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PAS-C or long COVID) in cancer patients (lead: Kaiser Permanente; co-leads: FIMR-Northwell, Cedars-Sinai) Aim 1b: Vaccine effectiveness for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 and long COVID in persons with autoimmune disease including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (lead: FIMR-Northwell; co-lead: Kaiser Permanente) Aim 1c: Vaccine effectiveness for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 and long COVID in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) (lead: Case Western; co-lead: Johns Hopkins)  Aim 2: To conduct meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies from eight SeroNet institutions (Cedars-Sinai,  Johns  Hopkins,  Feinstein-Northwell,  Emory  University,  University  of  Minnesota,  Arizona  State University, Mount-Sinai, Yale University) to determine: Aim  2a:  Post-vaccine  immune  responses  on  SARS-CoV-2-related  and  disease-related  outcomes  among patients with lung cancer (lead: Mount Sinai, co-lead: Cedars-Sinai) Aim  2b:  Post-vaccine  immune  responses  on  SARS-CoV-2-related  and  disease-related  outcomes  among patients with hematologic cancers/hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients (lead: Cedars-Sinai, co-lead: Yale) Aim 2c: Post-vaccine immune responses on SARS-CoV-2-related and disease-related outcomes among SOTR (lead: University of Minnesota, co-lead: Johns Hopkins) Aim  2d:  Post-vaccine  immune  responses  on  SARS-CoV-2-related  and  disease-related  outcomes  among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (lead: Arizona State University) Aim  2e:  Post-vaccine  immune  responses  on  SARS-CoV-2-related  and  disease-related  outcomes  among patients with SLE (lead: Emory University; co-lead: FIMR-Northwell)  Aim 3: To investigate heterogeneity in vaccine effectiveness according to age and social determinants of health (SDoH), common clinical risk factors, and laboratory-based correlates of immunohematologic function using pooled data assembled for Aim 1 and 2. Aim  3a:  Heterogeneity  in  post-vaccine  immune  responses  by  age,  sex,  ethnicity/race,  geography,  and socioeconomic status (lead: Johns Hopkins; co-lead: Cedars-Sinai and Case Western) Aim 3b: Heterogeneity in post-vaccine immune responses by tobacco use, diabetes, heart failure, and modifiable atherosclerotic risk factors (lead: Case-Western; co-lead: Kaiser Permanente) Aim 3c: Heterogeneity in post-vaccine immune responses by extent of antecedent anemia, anisocytosis, and lymphopenia (lead: Case-Western; co-lead: Kaiser Permanente) Introduction A.2. COVID-19 vaccination substantially reduced morbidity and mortality associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus  2  (SARS-CoV-2)  infection  and  severe  illness.    However,  despite  effective  COVID-19 vaccines many questions remain about the efficacy of vaccines and the durability and robustness of immune responses, especially in immunocompromised persons. For example, patients with lung cancer have a greater than sevenfold higher rate of becoming 1 infected with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19, a greater than threefold higher hospitalization rate with high complication rates, and an estimated case fatality rate of more than 30%.2 The potential  effects  of malignancy  and/or  anticancer treatments  on  COVID-19  vaccine response  as  well  as  the impact of a vaccine on anticancer treatment, incidence of adverse events and progression and long COVID, are unclear.  Several  studies  show  that  solid  organ  transplant  recipients  (SOTR)  who  receive  a  variety  of immunosuppressive regimens to prevent organ rejection, have substantially lower seroconversion rates,3-6 and the durability of the immune response in these individuals is unclear.7,8 Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants have poor survival, especially when infected within the first year after transplantation and if they have high immunodeficiency index.9 Humoral vaccine response in stem cell transplant and CAR-T patients is limited and affected by time interval between transplant and vaccination, immunosuppressive therapy and lymphocyte  counts  at  vaccination.10  People  living  with  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  are  also  at  an increased risk of COVID-19 and severe disease manifestations.11,12 The effects of antiretroviral therapy or HIV-related immunosuppression on vaccine response are unclear.13 In addition, individuals living with HIV may have immunological features that result in different B-cell or T-cell responses when compared to immunocompetent HIV  negative  individuals.14-16  Published  studies  on  the  immune  response  to  SARS-CoV-2  vaccination  in immunocompromised population show significant variability in immune response to vaccination. Current studies are limited by sample size and inability to evaluate heterogeneity in treatment, sex, race/ethnicity, age and other social determinants of health (SDOH).13,17,18 Further studies of humoral and cellular immunity and safety profiling after completion of primer and booster vaccinations in immunocompromised populations are needed. SeroNet  has  several  institutions  focused  on  conducting  epidemiologic  studies  in  immunocompromised populations  using  either  EMR-based  real-world  approaches  and/or  building  novel  prospective  cohorts  with longitudinal assessments. When combined, there are substantive populations of patients with cancer, including hematological malignancies, solid cancers, and hematopoietic cell transplants. The cohort groups are accrued and followed prospectively for endpoints of interest and impacts of various immunotherapies/cancer treatments. In addition, there are large number of patients with autoimmune diseases, patients living with HIV and SOTR. We  propose  to  leverage  the  existing  infrastructure  to  establish  the  SeroNet  Pooling  Project.  Our  general approach will be to establish a forum to coordinate a synchronized effort to pool individual-level data on immuno-compromised populations across multiple SeroNet sites across the U.S. Our proposal will leverage the existing SeroNet  Epi  Ops  and  Data  Ops  Working  Groups  infrastructure  to  formulate  a  plan  of  action  to  harmonize, synchronize and transfer data across participating sites and facilitate meta-analyses of individual-level data to answer  critical  research  questions  in  immunocompromised  populations.  We  plan  to  facilitate  parallel  data harmonization  and  analyses  on  specific  immunocompromised  populations  (i.e.,  lung  cancer,  hematologic malignancies/HSCT, SOTR, HIV and SLE) using a model where different sites are assigned to lead or co-leading different research questions. Lastly, we plan to disseminate results through scientific publications, adherence to data sharing policies and wider community-level communications of SeroNet findings.  A.2. Our  goal  is  to  build  upon  the  existing  SeroNet  consortium  to  create  bridges  that  link  individual  SeroNet awardees/sites in a common goal: to finally be able to answer clinically relevant research and medical practice questions  in  unique  immunocompromised  subpopulations.  While  many  SeroNet  sites  are  recruiting immunocompromised populations, we often require larger sample sizes to address certain questions than what is  currently  available  at  single  center.  Pooling  data  offers  unique  opportunities  to  address  more  granular questions around specific diseases and specific therapeutics in addition to evaluating potential disparities by sex, geography and race/ethnicity. Our approach to conduct both (1) EMR-based RWD and (2) meta-analyses of  cohorts  is  innovative.  We  will  use  an  integrative  data  analysis  approach  to  merge  separately  collected epidemiologic  data  from  multiple  cohort studies into  a  single, more  powerful  dataset  to  investigate  complex interactions. This approach is ideal for investigating sources of heterogeneity, given that cohort studies are often limited by low representation of vulnerable groups defined by specific treatments, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic (SES), geographic region, age, or the intersections of these factors. The result of this Pooling Project will be an efficient and powerful means to obtain additional knowledge on questions of immune response in vulnerable populations, with data that are relatively robust and externally valid.

Each SeroNet site has designated a representative from its parent award (Tables 1 and 2) with outlined  responsibilities.  We  have  members  with  a  diverse  clinical  and  research  background  in  oncology, hematology,  infectious  diseases,  epidemiology,  pathology,  cardiovascular  medicine,  clinical  informatics,  and biostatistics. In addition to the steering committee, operational subcommittees include: (1) Data Informatics to oversee standardization of the data definitions, integration of data from EMRs or cohorts, and conduct analyses (Figure 2). This subcommittee will consist of staff analysts at each site and will meet regularly. Activities will be shared with the SeroNet Data Coordinating Center to ensure alignment with the variable definitions of the CBCs as well as compatibility with the data model for easy uploading to ImmPort. (2) Project-specific committees to oversee analyses/manuscripts and other deliverables for each Specific Aim and will be led by the responsible institution (e.g., Lung Cancer Subcommittee led by Fred Hirsch for Aim 2a).  Data Sources: EMR-based RWD: To support Specific Aims 1a-1c and 3a-3b we will obtain EMR-based RWD from four health systems  (Table  1).  Data  will  be  extracted  using  standardized  algorithms  using  ICD-10  codes  to  identify immunocompromised persons (hematologic and solid organ malignancy; SOTR; autoimmune disease, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and SLE).  In addition, we will use common case definitions to extract  data  on  demographic  (age,  sex,  race/ethnicity),  laboratory  values  (e.g.  complete  blood  cell, comprehensive  metabolic  panel),  clinical  co-morbidity  (e.g.,  Charlson  index  comorbidity  score),  COVID-19 vaccination,  SARS-CoV-2  infection  and  severe  COVID-19,  and  disease-specific  variables.  Data  accrual  will adhere to a federated model, in which individual sites will retain the fully granular case data, and will be sharing deidentified aggregate data sets for analysis.

To define and merge study measures across studies, we will  use  existing  harmonization  pipelines  in  part developed by the SeroNet Data Coordinating Center (Anjan Purkayastha and team). Our approach will be multi-step  (Figure  2).  This  involves  examining  the questionnaires  and  data  dictionaries  for  each  study site to identify site-specific data elements that map to initially  defined  common  integrated  data  elements (examples in Figure 3). Through an iterative process, we communicate with each site to obtain relevant data and  coding information.  The  data elements  are  transformed  to  a  common data platform and combined into a single dataset  with definitions, standardized  permissible  values,  and coding.  Real  world  data  analyses  (Aim  1a-c): To  determine  vaccine  effectiveness  for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 EMR-based data  on different immunocompromised population, we will extract EMR data on immunocompromised persons and age-sex matched comparison group specific for each population.  Key data elements  will  include  baseline  demographics,  clinical  comorbidities,  and  therapeutic  regimes;  SARS-CoV-2 infection  status  (by  PCR)  and/or  SARS-CoV-2  antibody  status  (as  known)  either  at  onset  of  the  pandemic (March/April 2020) or at time of subsequent initial patient encounter and during follow-up, vaccination status (including boosters), and the incidence of severe COVID-19 (defined by hospitalization). Retrospective data will constitute  the  initial  statement-of-work,  followed  by  repeat  data  pulls  during  the  2-year  study  period,  with harmonization to prior patient data sets. We will use survival analysis to estimate the effectiveness of additional doses  of  COVID-19  vaccination  in  immunocompromised  persons  versus  non-immunocompromised  persons. Multivariate  analysis  will  be  conducted  using  Cox  proportional  hazards  models.  Each  site  will  conduct  the analysis locally and aggregated deidentified results will be shared across sites for meta-analyses. This minimizes the risk associated with transfer of large individual-level clinical data sets.   Meta-analyses of prospective cohort analyses (Aim 2a-e): The data will be entered into pre-defined forms by  analysts  at  each  site.  These  forms  will  include  variable  definitions  agreed  upon  by  the  Data  Informatics committee and by investigators leading specific analyses (for disease-specific variables). Standard methods for individual-level meta-analyses will be used including estimating pooled rates with 95% confidence intervals and investigating potential study heterogeneity. Sub-group analyses will be performed by 1) subtypes of disease (e.g., lymphoma v. multiple myeloma v. leukemia) and 2) type of therapy (e.g., CD20 v. CD38).  Heterogeneity (Aim 3a):  We will analyze immunocompromised patient clinical and serology data to examine how demographic variables, such as age and sex, intersect with SDOH, including race and ethnicity, to predict SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immunity and outcomes over time. Principle component analysis (PCA) will be used  to  explore  clustering  of  serological  and  clinical  data  by  demographic  and  SDOH  variables.  We  will implement standard biostatistical methods, such as linear mixed effects models and statistical testing of null hypotheses  for  group  differences,  in  the  prospective  cohort.  EMR-based  RWD  will  be  analyzed  for  vaccine effectiveness using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. SDOH variables will be added to the base regression model with age and sex variables to examine how SDOH modify the hazard ratio.  Public Health Relevance and Timeline: This Pooling Project represent one of the largest collaborations to harmonize data across health systems and prospective observation cohorts to assess vaccine effectiveness and post-vaccine responses in well-defined groups of immunocompromised persons. Given the scope and scale of this project, we request a 2-year administrative supplement. The additional time will substantially improve the overall productivity of this project and allow us to address new questions as the pandemic evolves and new data is generated and available to harmonize at each site.

FP00034515,824,,,,,1,,,"              Food Waste Reduction  FY22-23 Project Statement of Work  1.0  Background The City of Phoenix, in collaboration with Arizona State Universitys College of Health Solutions and Walton Sustainability Solutions Service, proposes to engage up to 500 households in a new program and research study to reduce household food waste and increase composting of excess food. Households will include those in areas more significantly affected by COVID-19 in the past two years as well as other underserved areas (for example, those living in food desert areas of the city). Participants in the Citys ongoing backyard gardening program may also elect to participate.  The proposed program is an important area of study. The National Academies recently issued a comprehensive report on consumer food waste reduction given its important role in sustainability, health, and even household financial security. The report highlighted our current understanding of how food waste is generated in the household including attitudes about food waste, potential drivers of food waste, and perceived barriers to reduce food waste. The report also identified important gaps in the literature, including a limited number of rigorously designed interventions that included a control group as part of the experimental design. This is a key component of behavioral research studies that provides stronger evidence on the effectiveness of interventions.  Developing strong research behind municipal programs such as that proposed by the City of Phoenix can therefore serve two key purposes. First, the program can identify applicable, scalable strategies to address the problems that arise from household food waste, which range from larger scale waste and environmental issues to smaller scale impacts on healthy eating and personal finances. The City of Phoenix has committed to zero waste by 2050 as a major sustainability goal, and food waste constitutes a major component of the waste stream in Phoenix. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 63.1 million tons of food waste were generated in the commercial, institutional, and residential sectors in 2018, representing 21.6% of total municipal solid waste generation. Across consumer, retail, and supply chain environments, food lost to waste amounts to 150 trillion calories of unconsumed food each year, enough to provide every American more than 1200 calories of daily dietary intake (generally, the recommended daily caloric intake is 2,000 calories a day for women and 2,500 for men). Further, were landfills envisioned as a nation, their methane emissions would be third behind the US and China, making them a key source of climate change impacts. Importantly, for the average family of four, food waste represents up to $1500 of take-home annual income. Because the largest proportion of household food waste comprises perishable food items, including fruits and vegetables, this also represents lost opportunities for healthful eating. Americans continually fail to consume adequate servings of fruits and vegetables daily; reducing food waste among households therefore translates to possibilities for healthier diets. Taken together then, addressing the problems of food waste can drive environmental, health, and financial benefits for both the City and its residents. This program will therefore strive to provide a set                 of actionable deliverables guiding the City on residential food waste reduction, an approach begun with some success in the initial collaboration on food waste reduction our team conducted previously. Second, the Citys program can include research to document its impact in a rigorous way. In doing so, it can contribute to filling key knowledge gaps in the literature base, which can drive solution generation for household food waste on a grander scale. Developing a successful, evidence-based approach to household food waste reduction can help the City be a leader in providing key information for other municipalities around the country to further their own sustainability efforts as they relate to food waste reduction. 2.0  Project Team Walton Sustainability Solutions Service (WSSS) at the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University will collaborate to complete the proposed scope. The team includes:   Christopher Wharton, PhD  College of Health Solutions   Maricarmen Vizcaino, PhD  College of Health Solutions   William Campbell  Walton Sustainability Solutions Service   Graduate Research Assistant (TBD)    Undergraduate Research Assistant  bilingual (TBD) 3.0  Description The ASU Rob and Melani Walton Sustainability Solutions Service (Solutions Service), together with the Radical Simplicity Lab in the College of Health Solutions at ASU, propose to collaborate with the City of Phoenix to conduct a study of a proposed food waste reduction program. Some study details will be developed in concert with the City in relation to logistical possibilities with partners. However, an overall study description follows along with a budget and project timeline. We propose first to conduct a pilot study in order to ensure materials delivery, logistics of data collection, and other aspects of the study are systematic and functional. The pilot will consist of 5-10 households who will follow all the procedures described below. The pilot study will allow researchers to fix any issues related to delivery of the intervention, and then to scale up in preparation for a study incorporating hundreds of households. After the pilot and review of study delivery, the team will conduct a randomized controlled trial  the gold standard in medical research because of its potential to deliver the highest level of evidence by controlling diverse types of bias. Participants will be randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group. The study will be based on the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM) by Klockner & Baum, a theoretical model developed to examine ecological behavior that combines the strengths of previous behavior-change models. Our team has previously tested and established empirical validity of the CADM to successfully describe the different factors that contribute to household food waste across both national and international samples. The ASU study team will work                 with the City, using its existing resources to launch an application process to recruit up to 500 households into the study. Households will meet specific inclusion/exclusion criteria established by the City and the research team. Some of these criteria will include household access to the internet, respondents who are adults 18 years of age and older and the primary food purchaser in the home (i.e., the individual who does most of the grocery shopping for the household), and only residents of the City of Phoenix. Participants will be asked to complete an introductory survey including key measures of behavior change constructs related to the CADM (these include theoretically based constructs such as personal norms, social norms, habit, and environmental barriers among others), food security, and relevant demographics at the household level. The survey will also include a single item measure of perceived food waste previously established by our lab to be a valid subjective measure of food waste. Lastly, participants will complete a short food appreciation scale developed by our lab. Participants will then be randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group in roughly equal numbers (e.g., n = 250 experimental, n= 250 control). All participants will receive supplies for collecting food waste for pickup by the Citys contracted waste collectors, which may include compostable bags and/or buckets. In this scenario, the research team will label bags/buckets with a code that will be assigned to each participating household (e.g., S01, S02, etc.). Participants will be trained on how to collect food waste using the bags/buckets, and how to dispose of them for waste collectors weekly or biweekly removal (to be determined by the waste collection organization responsible for pick-up). Either the participants or the food waste collectors will weigh each households total food waste weekly or biweekly and report total weight by household to the study team. This will be done using online forms for easy completion and immediate access to data by the research team.  The first two weeks of the study will establish baseline levels of food waste for all households. After the two-week baseline, the experimental group will be contacted to begin receiving educational content. The experimental group will be contacted on a weekly basis for five weeks. Each week will represent a different content theme that has been established by the literature to be a key area of education for food waste reduction. Both the experimental and control groups will be asked to continue measuring their food waste during the duration of the intervention.  Educational content will include web-based text information, downloadable tools, infographics, videos, and a podcast delivered through an interactive online portal. Some of these materials have already been developed and/or selected by our research in a previous research collaboration with the City of Phoenix. Based on our findings that indicated greater interest for infographics and greater perceived usefulness for the videos, we will update our materials and provide emphasis on these modes of delivery. In addition, content will be translated and delivered in Spanish, integrating materials published elsewhere in Spanish as well (e.g., links to recipes in Spanish). All materials will be delivered in the intervention using a Canvas site (the common learning platform used at ASU), allowing the research team to control when content is available to participants. However, after the                 intervention is conducted, all materials will be transferred to a web site to be available publicly indefinitely. After five weeks of the educational intervention, the experimental group will complete a survey including all the same baseline measures. Thereafter, follow-up data collection will occur after three months and again at six months post-intervention to evaluate the persistence of any changes in household food waste and related behaviors and attitudes. Each week of participation will be incentivized for participants to maintain retention in the study. Incentives are estimated at $10 per week. The control group will be considered a wait-listed control group. This means that once the experimental group has completed its intervention, the control group will receive access to the same intervention materials along the same timeline as the original experimental group. This format ensures that the study can be used to conduct rigorous comparisons between groups while also allowing all participants across both groups to eventually receive the intervention. Lastly, the team also proposes to conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews with Hispanic participants that enroll into the study. Previous food waste prevention studies in the US have mostly focused on non-Hispanic White participants. Thus, it is still unknow what cultural factors may facilitate or hinder food waste prevention among the different ethnic/racial groups of the US population. To our knowledge, no previous food waste prevention study has been conducted with Hispanic adults. Given that the proportion of the Hispanic population in the City is more than 42%, we believe this to be a priority population in the present study.   4.0  Deliverables The study will provide the City of Phoenix with the following deliverables:   Current State Assessment:  Baseline measures will provide the City with insight into households current levels of food waste in key geographical areas of concern to the City. Baseline measures may also provide valuable information on drivers of food waste among Phoenix families such as household size and environmental barriers.   Program Evaluation: The study will provide insight into the effectiveness of the program for food waste reduction. It may also provide measures of food waste diverted to composting. It would also be possible to include evaluation measures, including assessments of attrition in the program, participant attitudes about the program and what they valued, etc.    Advancement of Sustainability Science: The study will also significantly advance the current state of the science as well as provide the City useful tools for scaling the program or acting as a leader/consultant to other interested municipalities, including web-based tools in two languages. The data might also be used to assess financial savings related to food waste diversion from landfills.   Public Resources for Food Waste Prevention: The study will update its current website with most recent science-based educational materials. In addition, it will provide all of the content in Spanish to increase inclusion among Phoenix residents.    Reporting and Food Waste Reduction Tools: The study will include interim and final reporting so that the City and interested stakeholders can understand the progress and impact of the   study. Further, the research team will provide workshops with stakeholders at the end of the study to discuss the tools used, how to scale them, and other actionable opportunities for the City in relation to household food waste reduction.               5.0  Project Cost & Terms Project cost payable from City of Phoenix to ASU is $452,137. These costs will be incurred in FY22-24. The project is expected to take approximately 21 months (October, 2022  June, 2024). City of Phoenix shall remit not less than fifty percent (50%) of the total contract price upon approval of this Statement of Work. The remaining amount of the contract price due under this Agreement shall be paid upon receipt of an invoice from ASU at completion of the project. Invoices are due and payable within 30 days. ASU will mail invoices to the City of Phoenix contact identified.  The City of Phoenix will consent, upon successful completion of the project, to the development and publication of a short (1- to 2-page) case brief explaining the challenge, project approach, solution and impacts of the project. Such consent would be dependent on the City of Phoenixs satisfaction with the results. The case brief would be posted on ASU websites and used as the basis for public relations, marketing and ASU student education. This proposal is not the final contractual agreement between ASU and the City of Phoenix. Once the proposal is agreed to, the letter obligating IGA funds will be issued to ASU by the City of Phoenix.

We anticipate the higher potassium sports drink will lead to better rehydration by optimizing intracellular fluid rehydration.Summary of Proposed Research:Twelve healthy, physically active males aged 18-55 y will participate in this crossover counterbalanced study. Each subject will repeat the experiment four times, with the only difference being the type of drink consumed during the rehydration portion of the protocol.Subjects will visit the lab after at least 10h of fasting, and they will consume a light breakfast. An intravenous catheter will be placed in an antecubital vein, and a blood sample will be taken after 20 min for baseline. Dehydration will be accomplished on the morning of testing via mild exercise and heat exposure to elicit a body weight loss of -2%. The subjects will perform four bouts of 25-min low-intensity exercise and 5 min rest (alternating cycling & walking) or till they reach -2% of body weight dehydration. Following a 20 min rest in a thermo-comfortable environment, a dehydrated baseline blood sample will be taken, and the subjects will start the rehydration protocol. The volunteers will consume one of the four drinks below in a cross-over balance mode. During the first hour, four equal doses will be consumed in15-min intervals at a total volume of 150% of their body weight loss.Drinks: Water, GoodSport, Gatorade, and BodyArmorBlood and urine samples will be collected for hydration biomarker assessment. Body weight will be recorded, and intra- and extracellular fluid volume will be assessed during baseline and rehydration.",
FP00034721,827,,,,,1,,,"Overview. Modern scientific research depends on large, heterogeneous datasets as well as computational methods that power the generation, curation, storage, transmission, and analysis of these modern datasets. Among computational methods, simulation has proven itself to be a versatile solution over a broad range of research questions and scientific domains. Across domains, researchers rely on computational simulations in the development of explanations, predictions, and validations of complex systems. Today, simulations are no longer just used to generate artificial datasets, and data-driven, empirical simulations are often used to develop explanations and predictions of complex systems. In every area of bioscience-related research, from biophysics to biodiversity, harnessing the data revolution requires scalable techniques to separate signal from noise. As datasets become larger and more complex, graduate students need specialized training to create larger and more complex simulation software. This specialized training includes not only technical dimensions of research software engineering but also social aspects of it as well. The underlying goal of this project is to educate a group of graduate trainees from the natural and data sciences in techniques for large-scale computational simulation and modern practices of research software engineering. While the majority of research software, including computer simulations, is written by trainees in traditional STEM graduate programs, these programs do not have the capacity to teach students specialized knowledge relevant for research software engineering. Due to these training deficiencies, when STEM trainees create computational tools, the code is often unreadable, incorrect, inefficient, not portable, undocumented, unavailable, missing version control, and/or lacking tests.  The lack of specialized training harms the reuse, reproducibility, and dissemination of research software requiring researchers to continually reinvent computational wheels. Given the importance of research software in modern research programs, this lack of training is a pressing problem for the scientific community and society in general. This project expects to train a total of 123 PhD and Masters students: 24 NRT trainees receiving NRT stipend support, 24 additional, unsupported NRT trainees, and another 75 non-NRT graduate students who will participate in project funded activities. Participants will receive project-based training in understanding diverse bioscience datasets, programming, modern research engineering (including teamwork), computational pedagogy (via the Carpentries), simulation design, data analysis, high-performance computing, and complex ethical, policy, legal, and societal-value issues that arise in modern software and data analysis projects. Trainees will participate in a community of practice that will create an interdisciplinary environment where students can contribute their own domain-level knowledge, while learning specialized but broadly-applicable skills. Keywords: Track 1; research software engineering; computational simulation; computational biosciences; bioscience data; open-source software; Python programming; R programming; Carpentries pedagogy; Software Enterprise pedagogical model  Intellectual Merit. Trainees will participate in a convergent community of practice in the area of Large-Scale Simulations for Bioscience Research (BIOSIM). Trainees will contribute to a variety of projects within this area including improving existing open-source simulation software, creating new, large-scale simulation software, and working on smaller, student-led research projects. Students will apply their software to answer fundamental questions in bioscience research through the analysis of large-scale datasets and complex systems.  Broader Impacts. Research software generated by NRT trainees and other participants in project activities will be open-sourced, impacting research in a wide array of fields. The project will also produce researchers with strong skillsets in modern practices for research software engineering, resulting in downstream improvements in the quality of research software as they move forward with their careers. During the project, ASU will continue its platinum membership with the Carpentries Organization, a global community teaching foundational computational and data science skills to researchers in academia, industry, and government. This project expects to train at least 75 new Carpentries instructors. This includes both NRT trainees and additional students, faculty, and staff at ASU and neighboring institutions (e.g. community and tribal colleges in Arizona). These Carpentries instructors will contribute to the Carpentries community by teaching workshops, maintaining lessons, and/or in other capacities. Their efforts will help broaden participation in computing. ",

FP00034774,831,,,,,1,,,"Approximately fifty percent of cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality have been attributed to nutrition insecurity. Nutrition insecurity is characterized by sub-optimal diet quality and unsafe food practices and often co-occurs with food insecurity. In 2016, about 40% of adults with income above 130% of the federal poverty level had poor diet quality compared to approximately 60% of adults with income at or below 130% of the federal poverty level. The high prevalence of poor nutrition among low-income individuals highlights the need for interventions that aim to improve diet quality such as nutrition education interventions.Food pantries provide emergency food assistance to community members and are uniquely positioned to address poor diet quality among vulnerable populations. Food pantries can target poor diet quality by providing access to healthy food options. Food pantries can also equip clients with nutrition education that aims to increase their willingness to choose healthy food options when available, as well as management of limited food resources. Increasing access to nutrition education is critical given the documented evidence of improved nutrition outcomes, such as diet quality, safe food practices, and food resource management, among individuals who participate in nutrition education. Further food pantries occasionally employ community health workers (CHWs) to assist clients with addressing other social or health needs through navigation to other community resources. Training CHWs to deliver evidence-based nutrition education or navigate clients to such programs has the potential to improve diet quality among food pantry clients. The USDAs Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) is an evidence-based nutrition education program that targets low-income community members. EFNEP can be delivered by professionals and paraprofessionals. EFNEP aims to address nutrition insecurity by providing interactive nutrition and physical activity education to low-income populations. About 93% of EFNEP participants report improved dietary quality. EFNEP participation has been associated with a seven-point increase in adjusted Health Eating Index-an index that assesses adherence to dietary guidelines. EFNEP participation has also been shown to improve food security, physical activity, and resource management.  Despite the demonstrated positive effect of EFNEP, the program reach remains sub-optimal. In 2021, EFNEP reached about 200,000 low-income adults and 450,000 low-income youth which is less than three percent of the 25.6 million adults living in poverty. There is inadequate information regarding barriers and facilitators to EFNEP delivery or referral by agencies that work with low-income community members such as food pantries. There is also limited information regarding barriers and facilitators of EFNEP participation among low-income community members. My long-term goal is to increase participation in evidence-based nutrition education programs by food pantry clients while leveraging community resources and partnerships to increase the availability of healthy and nutritious food at local food pantries. This small research project (SRP) will build upon my current research that seeks to identify determinants of healthcare use and health outcomes among food pantry clients and to implement nutrition interventions to improve health behavior and health outcomes among food pantry clients. This SRP will advance this area of research inquiry using the following aims:Specific Aim 1: To identify barriers and facilitators to EFNEP delivery or referral by food pantry personnel. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with 5-10 food pantry and EFNEP personnel using an interview guide informed by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior (COM-B) framework. Specific Aim 2: To identify barriers and facilitators to EFNEP participation by food pantry clients. We will conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews with 10 food pantry clients. The interview guide will also be developed using the COM-B framework.",
FP00034786,832,,,,,1,,,"The future workforce and current thought leaders in precision nutrition need in-depth knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) to harness the power of modern technologies such as multi-omics and wearables to combat diet-related chronic diseases related to the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Arizona State University (ASU), through the College of Health Solutions (CHS), is poised to meet this need through its multidisciplinary, transformative new structure. CHS has organized its research enterprise and academic programs into Translational Teams, wherein faculty, trainees, and community stakeholders work together to more rapidly translate basic discovery into practice. We propose a predoctoral and postdoctoral training program - rooted in foundational disciplines of nutrition and big data analytics - that will focus on courses and practical experiences related to precision nutrition. Students will be drawn from long-standing and successful PhD programs in Exercise & Nutritional Sciences and Biomedical Informatics, both of which are already housed within CHS and have strong collaborative ties among faculty and programmatic requirements. Our training program will provide an interdisciplinary, comprehensive training in precision nutrition topics, reflecting the expertise of our mentor team in nutrition and metabolism (obesity and diabetes; microbiome and functional foods; energy balance; wearable technologies; and digital health interventions) and artificial intelligence and systems modeling (multimodal and multiscale data integration; systems biology; actionable and interpretable AI; AI-based personalization ; time-series and mobile device analytics; and geographic information systems). The training program will support nine new predoctoral students and two postdoctoral students, each of whom will be mentored by a multidisciplinary pair of accomplished nutrition and big data analytics scientists. All trainees will be provided a hybrid-delivered bootcamp experience in nutrition and data science upon entry into the program to build a strong foundation for interdisciplinary training. Trainees will then sample from relevant courses in statistical and machine learning, energetics, nutrigenomics, clinical applications, adaptive trial design, etc... The training will be further supported by regular seminar series and journal clubs; experiential rotations; annual symposia; and community, industry, and healthcare-based internships. As an institution that serves >25% Hispanic population, our training program will emphasize recruitment of this and other underrepresented student populations and engage with disadvantaged communities. We will leverage our rich training environment of ongoing federally-funded projects, along with our collaborative partners at the Phoenix VA Healthcare System, and the NIDDK Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, to provide trainee access to diverse datasets specific to underrepresented populations of the Southwest. This interdisciplinary training program will produce the next-generation precision nutrition scientists capable of solving the complex biomedical challenges we face in combating diet-related chronic disease outcomes.",

FP00034913,835,,,,,1,,," Project Summary/Abstract The goal of the EDRN Southwest Clinical Validation Center for Head and Neck Cancer is to improve oropharyngeal cancer screening through the rigorous validation of salivary biomarkers. The scientific approach of our Center is based on several fundamental principles.  First, that human papillomaviral (HPV) infection and persistence induces carcinogenesis in the oropharynx over decades, generating well-documented circulating and salivary viral nucleic acid and serologic biomarkers. These biomarkers have not yet been tested in rigorous, prospective studies with centralized CLIA/CAP biomarker validation. Second, the low incidence requires that effective screening paradigms for oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) use novel systems for large-scale prospective studies using self-collection sampling, digital enrollment, and distributive systems to enable enrollment in underserved communities. Third, that the clinical management of positive biomarkers be rigorously addressed. Our proposal builds on our extensive experiences with cancer biomarker development, validation, innovative clinical study management, and expertise in HPV oropharyngeal cancer screening. Our previous results on HPV serologic biomarkers have been confirmed in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. Our results have shown that multiplexed panels of IgG antibodies for HPV16 are required for adequate predictive value.  Our Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC. (MSD) team has fielded over 3,000 instruments worldwide, and over 700 commercially available biomarker assay kits. Their expertise at serologic assay development led to one of their V-PLEX serology panels being selected by Operation Warp Speed as the basis of its standard binding assays for immunogenicity assessments in all funded Phase III clinical trials of COVID vaccines. We will use the MSD MULTI-ARRAY platform to migrate the HPV serologic markers for target clinical applications in saliva. This represents an ongoing collaboration with experts in large-scale self-collection salivary biomarker screening at Arizona State University, experts on head and neck cancer screening at Baylor University Medical Center, AT Still University School of Dentistry and Oral Health, and clinical partners at Valleywise Health Medical Center. We will generate high-quality well-characterized samples to validate circulating and salivary biomarkers to enhance oropharyngeal cancer screening. Adhering to the principles of PRoBE design, we will perform Phase 2 validation of HPV serology and nucleic acid testing with cancer patient and control sera and saliva, followed by developing and testing the methodology to conduct a prospective Phase 4 salivary screening study. We will provide a resource for expertise and clinical repository for the rigorous validation of salivary and circulating biomarkers for cancer screening.  ",
FP00034916,836,,,,,1,,,"Food insecurity (FI), or the lack of consistent access to affordable food, is a major public health problem that persists in the US. FI is associated with poor dietary quality, compromised physical and mental health, and poor academic performance. FI among college students has gained considerable attention in the past 5-10 years, given findings from numerous studies suggest that the prevalence of FI in college students is 3-4 times the national prevalence (~39% vs. ~10.5% in 2019, respectively). However, our published qualitative and quantitative data indicate that college students likely respond to FI measurement modules differently than the general population. In particular, college students may have a difficult time conceptualizing the term money in the items because students have a unique portfolio of monetary (e.g., income from employment, money from parents/family, scholarships/loans) and non-monetary (e.g., meal plans, free food events) food resources to consider when answering FI questions. Ultimately, interpretational inconsistencies may result in misclassification of FI, inaccurate prevalence estimates, and unknown impacts on health outcomes. To our knowledge, there is no reliable and validated measure of FI for college studentsand few studies have used rigorous methods to assess associations of health outcomes with FI. Thus, the overall purpose of this study is to develop and test a new measure of FI that is reliable and valid for the college student population, through a mixed-methods study from four large, diverse public 4-year institutions and one large, urban community college (5 institutions). Through our first primary aim, we will use qualitative methods to develop a novel measure through conducting iterative interviews with key subgroups of college students (n=120), and content experts in FI and college student health (n=20). Once we have a draft new measure from these conversations, in our second primary aim, we will conduct psychometrics of the new college FI measure among a random, representative sample of 2500 full-time college students, allowing for further refinement of the new measure. Finally, we will continue to test the construct validity of the measure by comparing associations of health (body composition, diet, physical activity, sleep, and mental health outcomes) and academic outcomes (e.g., GPA) with the new college FI measure and the standard household FI measure with a new random sample of students (n=2000). Objective measures of body composition, diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress will be used in order to improve the precision of the estimates of the effects of FI on vulnerable college students. This project will yield an accurate assessment of FI for the college student population, representing over 16 million youth, and will launch a new pathway of understanding FI and its health implications in the college student population. Findings will provide evidence for how to best spend limited federal dollars to target and assist those college students struggling with FI.",
FP00034917,837,,,,,1,,,"Despite the food first approach of collegiate athletic departments, most athletes report the use of nutritional supplements, some of which may contain banned substances. Unfortunately, athletes who use contaminated substances risk a positive doping test result; based on USADA data, roughly 1 in 5 doping cases in the US have been associated with the use of supplements containing undeclared doping substances. From a compliance perspective, most departments have guidelines restricting use of untested supplements, but based on our data many athletes (20-50%) are not compliant with these recommendations. This results in unnecessary risk forathletes, as well as limited risk control at a departmental level. This proposal aims to develop a short screening questionnaire to help identify student-athletes who are not compliant with rules requiring use of third-party tested nutritional supplements only. We will do this by surveying a representative student-athlete sample (n=560) of eight Pac- 12 athletic departments to determine their usage of third-party tested and non-tested nutritional supplements, and to identify their knowledge of, attitudes towards, motivations related to, and barriers to their use of third-party tested supplements. This information will allow us to 1) better define college athletes usage of tested and non-tested nutrition supplements, 2) deepen our understanding of athlete compliance with nutritional directives by determining the barriers to the use of tested products, and 3) relate their usage of tested products to their knowledge base, attitude, and the self-reported use of educational resources.Collectively, this information will deepen our understanding of athletes nutritional supplement use at the Pac-12 and on a national level, and it will provide athletic departments a means to identify individuals at risk of positive doping tests in the future. This will help athletic departments tailor interventions to increase athletes use of third-party tested products in the short- and long-term.",
FP00034920,838,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed project aims to adapt, evaluate, and disseminate a brief and accessible mobile-based intervention to reduce alcohol use and Intimate Partner Aggression (IPA) among couples from low-income communities. This project is composed of two phases. In Phase 1 (Years 1 and 2), an existing alcohol reduction and emotion regulation skills intervention will be adapted for use among high-risk couples from low-income communities. Intervention adaptation will entail a multi-step, iterative process where 10 professionals with expertise in working with couples from low-income communities (Aim 1a) and 10 couples from low-income communities (Aim 1b) will provide feedback on existing intervention content to identify how material and delivery can be tailored for the target population. Intervention acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention will then be examined via a mobile-based open-trial with 25 couples from low-income communities (Aim 2). During Phase 2 (Years 3 to 5), a mobile-based RCT will be conducted to test intervention efficacy (Aim 3a), mechanisms of change (Aim 3b), and potential moderators (Aim 3c). The proposed research is aligned with the long-term objective of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development (K08) Award, which will prepare Dr. Julia Hammett for a successful health-related research career focused on alcohol-facilitated IPA. Dr. Hammetts research during graduate school has focused on the risk and protective factors of IPA among couples from low-income communities. During her postdoctoral training, Dr. Hammetts work has examined the effects of alcohol use, one of the major contributing causes of IPA, on aggression and violence between intimate partners. The current award would allow Dr. Hammett to expand her training by developing brief, evidence-based alcohol and IPA interventions once transitioning to her new research faculty position. The long-term objective of this award will be achieved through a five-year training plan involving a carefully selected mentor team as well as targeted coursework and hands-on training experiences. Training will focus on intervention development, evaluation, dissemination, innovative methods to enhance technology-based interventions, and advanced qualitative methods. Mentors (Drs. Davis, Stappenbeck, Parrott, Berkel, and Daniels) are committed to the candidates training and each will provide unique expertise to the research and training plan. Support from this award will be essential to the candidates development as an independent clinical scientist with expertise to contribute to high-impact alcohol research by developing and testing tailored and accessible mobile-based interventions to reduce alcohol use and IPA. Arizona State University is committed to support the Candidate throughout the duration of the award and is well suited to provide a stellar training experience that will promote NIHs mission to develop early investigators who can be competitive for long-term research funding. Ultimately, the overall goal of the current program of research is to advance the field of alcohol-related IPA and to help at-risk, underserved populations.    ",

Using the Veterans Health Administration records, we will create a logistic regression model to identify patients at low and high risk for CA and therefore guide CA screening and earlier detection.  Strengths of our approach are a wide variety of clinical data (biometrics, medications, labs, diagnoses), use of structured data without need for imaging data, a large and diverse dataset, and development of a simplified score for enhanced implementation.  Abstract  Lay   Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is increasingly recognized as a cause of heart failure and other disabilities. Despite new life-saving therapies, cases may be undiagnosed; therefore, clinicians need predictive tools to identify patients at risk.  In this project, we will use a nationwide electronic health records from the Veterans Health Administration to create a predictive score which will identify patients with possible CA and therefore may benefit from additional cardiovascular screening.  We anticipate that development and subsequent adoption of this tool will help to reduce the burden of CA in the population.                   4/6/2021    DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A MULTIVARIABLE PREDICTION MODEL USING EHR DATA TO DIAGNOSE CARDIAC AMYLOIDOSIS (AL AND ATTR) IN VETERANS WITH NEW ONSET HEART FAILURE  SPECIFIC AIMS  1)  Develop a comprehensive dataset of Veterans with HF, with and without cardiac amyloidosis (CA), encompassing clinical and administrative variables that is ready for statistical analysis. 2)  Develop and validate a full and simplified predictive model for detection of CA (both AL and ATTR) to facilitate clinician decision-making.  BACKGROUND CA (both ATTR and AL) is a fatal, systemic disease with high mortality but is often recognized years after initial presentation. 1  Fortunately, disease-modifying therapies that stabilize TTR are highly effective in reducing mortality (Number Needed to Treat for mortality is 8 in 33 months) and new therapies are under development.2   Unfortunately, CA (specifically wtATTR) is recognized on average more than 4 years after clinical presentation and in a quarter of patients, nearly 12 years. 3  Current screening for CA is primarily opportunistic and reactive rather than systematic and proactive.  That is, physicians may identify patients with risk factors for CA when evaluating a symptomatic patient with HF or aortic stenosis.  Physicians are taught to look for patients with red flag diagnoses such as carpal tunnel, spinal stenosis, and orthostatic hypotension.  The most recent ACC/AHA CA guideline lists 17 different diagnoses as clinical clues.1   However, the known conditions associated with CA represent clinical observations from amyloid experts rather than a validated prediction model to facilitate CA diagnosis.  For example, red flag diagnoses such as carpal tunnel may be more specific but less sensitive to detect CA compared to more prevalent diagnoses such as atrial fibrillation and heart block.  Therefore, without a validated prediction rule, the current approach to CA diagnosis is likely to under detect patients with CA and rely excessively on clinician experience.  Predictive models are urgently needed to improve CA diagnosis and clinical decision making.  Physicians need a prediction tool that will discriminate patients who need potentially burdensome screening with nuclear scintigraphy, blood testing, and in some cases, tissue biopsies.  For patients with a low risk of CA, a well-validated tool would avoid needless radiation exposure, cost, time, and invasive procedures associated with CA screening.  Conversely, a prediction tool would enable clinicians, including non-HF specialists, to refer high risk patients for CA screening at point-of-care and thereby improve accuracy and timeliness of CA diagnosis.  In the case of patients with AL CA, timely referral to a hematologist is essential given the median survival of less than 6 months without treatment. 4  Prediction models are widely utilized in cardiology to facilitate diagnosis and prognosis.  The HF2pEF score 5 estimates the likelihood of HFpEF using 6 simple clinical and echocardiogram characteristics to create a composite score ranging from 0 to 9.  The score can discriminate HFpEF from noncardiac causes of dyspnea and facilitate determination of further diagnostic testing.  Similarly, the VEST score is a screening tool for PAH that relies on 3 criteria from echocardiogram reports that discriminates patients with pulmonary vascular disease from other causes, thereby 4/6/2021    reducing the need for invasive pulmonary artery catheterizations.6  These are examples of easy to use, predictive models that are used daily by clinicians to facilitate decision-making.      Predictive tools for CA are not yet available in practice and have current efforts have limitations in generalizability and accessibility.  One research group developed a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts likelihood of ATTR CA. 7  The model was derived from medical claims datasets (IQVIA) and was narrowly focused on ATTR CA rather than including CA patients (i.e., those with AL CA) which limits the clinical utility.  Further, this model was not validated in the VA system which is necessary due to differences in case mix. That is, CA has a high predilection for men who compromise 98% of VA HF patients, and therefore prevalence of CA is likely higher in the VA. 8  The derivation data source was limited; it lacked important clinical data such as medications, labs, and procedures.  Other research groups have utilized ML of cardiovascular image data to identify pts with CA. 9 10 These are efforts are useful but have not been validated in external populations.  Further, these models require imaging data which would potentially bias selection towards sicker patients referred to cardiologists.  Thus, there remains a need for a simple electronic health record (EHR)-based model that can inform screening decisions across settings, including in primary care.  Veterans are a critical population impacted by CA, and the VA Health System has important strengths that can be leveraged. Veterans represent 1 in 14 Americans and 1 in 8 men.  Further, older age is a critical important predictor of ATTR 11, and 24% of Veterans are older than 75 years compared to 8% of non-Veterans. Veterans are a vulnerable population with higher risk for mental and physical health struggles.12  The VA EHR provides fully integrated patient record system across all VA medical centers, and this patient information can be linked to active-duty military and Medicare data.  Thus, the VA patient record will allow for longitudinal analysis across the course of a patients lifetime which is important for an indolent disease as ATTR CA.  Finally, access to costly therapies for CA (e.g., tafamidis) is excellent given low VA copays ($11 per month) 13 and low annual co-pay cap ($700) and provides an opportunity to study real-world effectiveness of treatment.     SIGNIFICANCE Creation of high performing statistical models will enable VA clinicians to identify and treat previously undiagnosed patients with CA. This will improve quality of life and life expectancy. Importantly, Veterans represent a vulnerable population including those affected by homeless, health illiteracy, and rurality. Establishing a population health approach to CA screening will advance the science and thereby facilitate improved CA detection in the general U.S. population.  METHODS For Aim 1, we will use the VINCI platform for data access and procurement from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). Data abstraction will be based on the variable and population specifications outlined below.  For Aim 2, we will develop and validate a predictive model for CA for clinical decision making. A list of potential predictor variables described below was compiled based on literature, cardiologist expertise, and our work utilizing the VA CDW. The purpose of this model is to create a predictive profile that can be used to quantify the probability of a patient being diagnosed with CA based on the predictor variables. In future work, this algorithm can then be wrapped in a software interface so that providers can easily calculate this probability while seeing patients.   4/6/2021    Source of Data and Participants: From the VA CDW, we will develop a cohort of Veterans with HF who sought any medical care in VA nationwide between June 1, 2019 and December 31, 2022.  June 2019 was chosen as the start date due to the approval of tafamidis, the first FDA-approved therapy for ATTR CA. The VA health system includes 126 hospitals plus additional community health centers.  Participants will be eligible to enter the denominator cohort if they have a new diagnosis of HF (inpatient or outpatient) in the prior 36 months.    Outcome: The outcome of interest (numerator) is CA, defined as new diagnosis of amyloidosis (ICD10 code, see Supplemental Table 1) and HF.  Because all patients must have recent onset of HF (within prior 36 months), this approach is intended to select for patients at earlier stages of CA, an important goal in reducing morbidity and mortality from this disease. A secondary model will use cardiac amyloidosis with diagnosis of HF at any time prior as the outcome of interest.  Predictors:  Predictors of interest include demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity), vital signs (pulse, BP, BMI), lab values (sodium, BUN, Cr, eGFR, hemoglobin, WBC, platelets, INR, albumin, NTBNP, troponin I), all inpatient and outpatient diagnosis codes, procedure codes, medications, and hospitalizations.  The diagnosis codes are comprehensive and therefore will include diagnoses that have a known association with CA including arthroplasty, carpal tunnel, spinal stenosis, and trigger finger.1   Sample size: Sample size will be determined by the size of the Veteran population with HF. Prior studies have reported approximately 25,000 cases of new onset HFrEF per annum in the VA. 8  Since HFrEF constitutes approximately half of all HF cases, we anticipate 50,000 cases per year which over the course of the study period (3.5 years) should allow for a sample size of 175,000 patients with HF.  Our pilot data indicates the prevalence of CA is approximately 500 per 100,000 Veterans in 2022.  Missing data: Missing data will not be imputed. However, pairwise deletion will be adopted in statistical analysis so that patient records on any non-missing variables will be included in model estimation. This approach is selected to avoid adverse selection of complete case analysis and is complimented by the ability of the planned statistical method to handle missing data.   Statistical analysis method:  A cross validation will be performed for model development and testing. We will use a random 70/30% training/validation split (by patient). For model development, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) will be used to quantify the association between predictor variables and the categorical outcome. This model is used when analyzing correlated observations such as multiple records from a single patient. Since it is expected that the database will contain multiple records per patient, the patient will be specified as a random effect. The provider will also be included as a random effect to account for patterns in diagnoses and ordering of diagnostic tests. Odds ratio 95% confidence intervals that do not contain the value 1.0 will be used to determine statistical significance for predictor variables. Non statistically significant variables will be dropped from the final model. Odds ratio parameter estimates will be reported to detail the predictive value of each input variable.   We will also test a GLMM random coefficients growth curve model to see if the accuracy of predictor variables changes over time. This growth curve model will include time as a random effect. We will use the likelihood ratio test to compare the random effects and random coefficients growth curve models. The final model developed in the training stage will be tested on the validation data 4/6/2021    using the same GLMM specifications as the training model. Cross validation accuracy metrics such as Area Under the ROC Curve and a confusion matrix will be used to assess the quality of the model.   The final algorithm will contain model regression coefficients for each variable and when run, will produce exact probabilities of presence of CA for a particular patient. This algorithm will be difficult to calculate during clinic visits without a software interface. We will therefore also create a simplified scoring system that can be used to easily categorize the probability of CA based on range values of predictors. We will categorize each predictor variable into 2-4 levels that will be based on clinical relevance, feasibility for providers to calculate during a clinic visit, and empirical findings (i.e., linear groupings that are predictive of CA diagnosis) from the model training and validation stages of the cross validation.  Risk groups: We will create risk groups based on the probability of CA diagnosis and we will develop these with clinical input. Risk groups will likely be categorized as high, intermediate, and low. A high-risk designation will designate a threshold that will stimulate a clinician to screen for CA.  Conversely, a low-risk group will be associated with a low likelihood of CA and potentially obviate a need for additional screening.  RESOURCES AND FACILITIES AVAILABLE  Southern Arizona VA Health Care System:  The team will have access to the VA CDW which contains all electronic health record data.  This is a high-performance, secure computing environment. Researchers have access to analytical applications such SAS and R. Further, our team will have access to a national VA network of health services researchers and staff who have expertise in analyzing VA data.   ASU: The team will have access to the Biostatistics Core, whose Executive Director is Ding-Geng Chen, elected fellow of the American Statistical Association and Professor in Biostatistics. Dr. Chen is an invaluable resource for any statistical assistance needed for this project. We will also have access to numerous computing programs such as SAS, R, and Stata, as well as database programs such as REDCap.  PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE, PRELIMINARY DATA:  For our preliminary work, we have access to a VA CDW sample of 500,000 Veterans from 2012 to 2022. We have calculated that the prevalence of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis has increased six-fold from 84 to 508 per 100,000 Veterans.  To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic description of cardiac amyloidosis in the VA population. We plan to submit this work in abstract form this Fall.  We also will report characteristics of patients with CA in separate abstract, including comorbidities, biometrics, medications, and laboratory values. This proposal aligns with our long-term interest in advancing care for patients with CA.  We have submitted a proposal to systematically screen all HF patients with Southern Arizona VA for CA and describe associated barriers and facilitator to implementation of CA screening.  Further, on January 14, 2023, we are holding the first CME conference (Updates in Cardiac Amyloidosis 2023) in the state Arizona that is dedicated exclusively to CA.  Finally, we are completing a scoping review manuscript of research studies that employ machine learning for detection of cardiac amyloidosis.  This publication will facilitate our work to build better predictive models utilizing statistical and machine learning approaches.                        4/6/2021    REFERENCES Maurer MS, Schwartz JH, Gundapaneni B, et al.

FP00034949,842,,,,,1,,,"This project aligns with the Health Behaviors Research Branch of NCIs Division of Cancer Control & Population Sciences focus area of policy and physical activity (PA). Physical inactivity is a public health crisis. Schools are prominent and accessible settings to promote childrens PA at the population level, and school-based policy may be an effective strategy to support children in meeting national PA guidelines. The state of Arizona recently passed ARS15-118 requiring two daily recess periods for all K-5 students  the first U.S. policy to target increased recess frequency in schools. Our proposed multilevel cluster-randomized hybrid trial will compare two implementation strategies (education and education+funding for playground supervision) to overcome barriers to policy adoption and implementation, and the policy effect on childrens PA.  State policy ARS15-118 was passed in the 2109-2020 school year, but major barriers persist including lack of knowledge and lack of funding to hire additional staff to supervise recess. This project compares the impact of providing education or education+funding for playground supervision on policy adoption, quality of recess implementation, and potential for sustainability (Aim 1) and the effectiveness of policy adoption and quality of recess implementation on changes in childrens segmented and overall PA accrual (Aim 2). This study utilizes sequential mixed methods framed under the Learning Health Policy Systems model and ecological framework of school policy and PA. A total of 26 schools will be randomly assigned to either an education or education+funding for playground supervision arm. The education arm will include email distribution of information about ARS15-118 and best practices for recess to principals. The education+funding arm includes information distribution and monetary support to hire two additional staff to supervise recess. Aim 1 will be assessed using data from surveys, direct observation, and principal interviews at participating schools using outcomes from the RE-AIM and PRISM frameworks. PA during recess, the overall school day, and outside of school (Aim 2) will be measured using accelerometry and direct observation among a randomly selected subset of third grade students (N=400) at schools in both intervention arms.   PA is a public health strategy to mitigate the risk of childhood obesity and associated chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Mandating two daily recess periods through state policy may be an effective strategy for population-level health improvement. This research has the potential to identify optimal implementation strategies to facilitate large scale adoption and implementation of similar policies nationwide and provide evidence of public health impact of state PA policy.

FP00034961,843,,,,,1,,,"The U.S. is still in the midst of a widespread opioid use epidemic. From 1999 to 2019 almost 500,000 people died from an opioid overdose (1), and over 2 million are now estimated to have an opioid use disorder (OUD) (2). OUD prevalence is disproportionately high among Medicaid enrollees (3, 4). The need for treatment far exceeds the supply of clinicians that prescribe and monitor medications for OUD (MOUD) (5, 6). MOUD are effective at reducing overdose deaths and improving outcomes, but are vastly underused, with only 25-40% of adults with OUD receiving MOUD (7-9). Emerging data suggest racial and ethnic disparities in the quality of care and outcomes for OUD. Studies have demonstrated racial, ethnic, geographic, age, and socioeconomic status (SES) differences in overdose death rates (10-14), patterns of opioid drug use and OUD (15-18), and patterns of treatment (19-22). Betterestimates using more sophisticated approaches to examining health equity are sorely needed. Few studies do more than scratch the surface of equity in OUD care; ideally such research would examine a combination of types of treatment and duration of care that takes into account differences that may compound across dimensions such as race, gender, and age group, referred to as intersectionality. Disparities may be exacerbated by differences in the regional availability and quality of care. Greater distance to MOUD prescribers is known to be associated with lower odds of receipt and continuity of MOUD (23); counties with higher-than-average rates of OUD typically have low treatment capacity; and there are racial/ethnic disparities in the availability of MOUD providers in neighborhoods segregated by race/ethnicity (24). Important changes in the clinical and practice environment have the potential to substantially interrupt patterns of care, disproportionately affecting Black and Latinx communities (25). The long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown, including the impact on the quality of care for OUD and further exacerbations of previous disparities in care (26). North Carolinas (NC) recent transformation of its Medicaid program offers an opportunity to examine an innovative set of high-powered incentives to advance equity. Using real-time NC Medicaid claims data, supplemented by claims from Medicare and private insurance (together accounting for over 75% of state residents) that will allow us to characterize provider level OUD care quality across payers, we will examine differences in OUD care quality by Medicaid beneficiaries intersectional status and examine key drivers of differences in quality. We will use nationalMedicaid data to compare patterns of OUD care quality in NC to the US as a whole and explore the use of electronic health record (EHR) data to provide an alternative assessment of OUD quality. Our aims are: Aim 1: Assess differences in the quality of OUD care by intersectional status, prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. H1.1: Older adults, Blacks, and men receive lower quality OUD care and the differencesare most striking at the intersection of these identities. H1.2: Comorbid behavioral health and other chronic conditions exacerbate the relationship between intersectional status and quality of care. H1.3: Regional factors such as rurality and other social determinants of health modify differences in the quality of OUD care. H1.4: The receipt of high-quality OUD care declined during COVID and pre-COVID differences in careby intersectional status have been exacerbated during the pandemic. Aim 2: Assess the extent to which differences in the receipt of high-quality OUD care are due todifferences in the availability of providers who provide high-quality OUD treatment by geographic area. H2.1: There are quality of care differences between providers who treat individuals from historically marginalized backgrounds with OUD. H2.2: Because of historical and ongoing residential segregation by race/ethnicity due to structural racism, there are differences in the closest distance to a high quality versus lowquality provider for Medicaid beneficiaries of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds with OUD. Aim 3: Compare differences by intersectional status in the receipt of high-quality OUD care prior to and after NC Medicaids transition to managed care. H3.1 Because of the emphasis on improving both quality and health equity, differences in the quality of care received by intersectional status will decrease. Understanding the differences in OUD care quality by intersectional status and the factors underlying anddriving those differences is critical to attaining an equitable, high-quality health care system. By identifying intersectional groups receiving lower quality of care and drilling down on the contextual factors surrounding these differences, including the local availability of high-quality providers, our results will guide policy makers indesigning a smarter set of incentives aimed at improving OUD care engagement and quality for all individuals.",

FP00034983,845,,,,,1,,,"Statement of needMy name is Maricarmen Vizcaino. I am a behavioral scientist in the making with the goal of building aresearch career that positively impacts peoples lives while protecting our planet and contributing to socialjustice. In our present times, more than ever, we need to build research paths that not only enhance individualhealth, but also protect the communities around us and our environment. This is the reason why I would like tofocus my research on the intersection between human health and sustainability.Through my academic training and collaboration with excellent senior investigators in varied fields, Ihave acquired a strong interdisciplinary background that allows me to approach a research question fromdifferent perspectives and to conduct research using diverse methodologies  from structural equationmodeling to examine the interaction of multiple social and environmental factors affecting behavior, tobiomarkers that quantify changes in glucose metabolism and the stress response following an intervention. Ifeel prepared to embark in an independent research career, but one of the biggest challenges I haveencountered is the lack of funding mechanisms for people with my background (Mexican national with atemporary work visa).Living in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, I used to cross the bridge every morning to attend the University ofTexas at El Paso and complete my undergraduate degree. After graduation, I decided to move to El Paso tocontinue my education and work towards my goal of becoming a behavioral scientist. I have been living in theUS for more than 15 years. I am very proud of my heritage and my culture, but I consider this country myhome. This is the place where I have grown into the person that I am today, where I have learned about thepotential of evidence-based science, and where I have built a life with my family  my daughter is American,bilingual, but her first language is English and thinks Phoenix is her home.I have been privileged to receive an advance education that allowed me to become fully bilingual andobtain a PhD degree. Still, I do not consider myself different from all the other immigrants that have come tothis country with the hope of living a better life and in the process contribute to their communities and makethis country a better place. In my case, the opportunity to obtain a robust academic preparation, the ability toconduct research in state-of-the-art facilities, and sadly the widespread violence and insecurity in my city waswhat prompt me to leave my country.Currently there are several programs that support early-career investigators from underrepresentedbackgrounds. Unfortunately, these opportunities are reserved for US citizens or permanent residents, and notimmigrants like me. For example, the LEAP for Diverse Scholars program from the American PsychologicalAssociation1 or the Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship Program from my own institution.2 This hasrepresented a strong obstacle during my academic journey despite my preparation and experience. Thus, theSBM Bridging the Gap Research Award represents an important opportunity to gain experience as anindependent researcher and successfully compete for a larger grant proposal, which may open up theopportunity for a tenure-track position in an American university.Description of proposed researchIncidence of diagnosed diabetes is higher in Hispanic adults compared to other race/ethnic groups inthe US according to data from 2017-2018 (Hispanic: 9.7%, Black: 8.2%, Asian: 7.4%, non-Hispanic White:5%).3 Hispanic adults with T2D are also regularly undertreated and consequently less likely to achieverecommended target glucose, lipid, and blood pressure levels, which places this subgroup of the US populationat a higher risk for diabetes-related complications (e.g., eye disease, liver disease), cardiovascular disease, andpoor quality of life.4,5Lifestyle interventions that effectively prevent T2D in the Hispanic population are scarce and presentseveral limitations, including robust cultural adaptations.6,7 All prior studies have primarily focused ondelivering the intervention in Spanish and in a community setting, some have included content specific forHispanics (e.g., Hispanic recipes), but none have reported considering the social norms, beliefs, and customsthat may facilitate or hinder behavior change within the context of Hispanic culture and environmentalbarriers (e.g., cost, disparities to health care access).6,7 This limitation is further augmented by the lack ofempirical evidence supporting the conceptual framework upon which some interventions are based. Forexample, The Vida Sana/Healthy Life program8 was based on the principles of social cognitive theory; however,the significance or relative importance of the theorys components (e.g., self-efficacy) were not formally tested.As a result, it is still uncertain which cultural elements are critical to incorporate in a T2D preventionintervention targeting Hispanics (e.g., social norms, beliefs, customs/habits) and how these elements interactwith perceived barriers (e.g., self-efficacy) and environmental constrains (e.g., cost, access).I propose the development of a plant-based diet T2D prevention intervention forHispanics that includes a robust cultural adaptation and that is grounded on a theoreticalframework supported by empirical evidence. The adoption of a plant-based diet is an ideal interventionfor a Hispanic cultural adaptation. Heritage can be nurtured by carefully crafting menus with recipes thatinclude traditional ingredients along with plant-based substitutions (e.g., chiles en nogada  a roastedpoblano chile stuffed with lentils instead of ground beef). Social customs can be incorporated by limiting, butnot eliminating completely, animal-source foods that are heavily ingrained in the Hispanic diet (e.g., carnesasadas for special days with plant-based frijoles charros) or by emphasizing plant-based dishes during Lent(Cuaresma as is known in Catholic celebrations).Plant-based diets  characterized by a higher consumption of plant-based foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables,legumes, seeds, nuts, whole grains) and lower consumption of animal-source foods (especially red meat) have been shown to provide cardiovascular benefits, improve metabolic control, and decrease the prevalence ofT2D.9-13 Simultaneously, plant-based diets limit diet-related environmental impacts by drasticallyreducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change, andpotentially safeguard valuable resources (e.g, water, land, labor) that are lost when fruits andvegetables are wasted.14-16Moreover, the factors that can facilitate or hinder the adoption of plant-based diet can be empiricallyexamined via the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), a theoretical framework that seeks toexplain ecological behavior.17 The CADM combines the strengths of previous behavior change models and theconcept of habit strength. Using structural equation modeling and the CADM framework, the relativeimportance of the different cultural elements of the proposed plant-based diet T2D prevention intervention forHispanics can be empirically tested.If funded, this will be the first study that conducts an in-depth exploration of the social norms, beliefs,customs, and environmental barriers that facilitate and/or hinder behavior change for T2D prevention amongHispanics that concurrently addresses the global emergency of climate change. This will also be the first studythat develops a T2D prevention intervention that is supported by an empirically tested theoretical framework.The results of this study will support the application for a NIDDK's K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Awardthat will propose a pilot trial to assess the feasibility to implement the newly developed plant- based dietintervention and its efficacy for improving metabolic control (hemoglobin A1c) and other cardiovascular riskfactors (lipid profile, blood pressure) among Hispanic adults at risk for developing T2D.Research planThe proposed research study will follow an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, in which the initialqualitative phase of data collection and analysis will inform and guide the final quantitative phase of datacollection:Qualitative Phase. Cultural elements that may facilitate and/or hinder the adoption of plant-based diets(e.g., social norms, customs) will be explored, along with perceived barriers (e.g., self-efficacy) andenvironmental constrains (e.g., cost, access to fruits/vegetables) via in-depth, qualitative interviews withHispanic adults at risk for developing T2D living in the US. Participants will be recruited through social media,listservs, and the surrounding community. Data collected will be transcribed, coded, and analyzed for majorthemes. Awarded funds will help to pay for social media ads, participant incentives, qualitative software,automated transcription, advanced training in qualitative data analysis, and student support. Qualitative phaseis expected to be completed in 9 months.Quantitative Phase. Results from the previous phase will guide the development of items that representthe different behavior-change constructs outlined in the CADM (e.g., personal and social norms, habits). Usingdata collected via research panels, items will be analyzed for construct validity and further integrated into thetheoretical model proposed (CADM). The overall model will be assessed for adequate fit; direct and indirectpathways will be assessed for statistical significance and relative contribution to explain the adoption of plantbaseddiets among Hispanic adults at risk for developing T2D living in the US. Awarded funds will help to payfor research panels and quantitative software license renewal. Quantitative phase is expected to be completedin 3 months.",

FP00035000,847,,,,,1,,,"Sustainability via Active Garden Education (SAGE) is an evidence- and garden-based physical activity and nutrition education program presently delivered in 40 low-income serving, early care and education (ECE; preschool) sites in Phoenix, Maricopa County, AZ. Gardens in ECE sites in underserved communities improve interest in and consumption of fruit and vegetables among young children; teach important science, social, and motor development skills; engage families and communities; and offer important outdoor learning opportunities. The overall objective of this project is to compare how three different SAGE implementation strategies impact measures of implementation (primary), sustainability (secondary), cost and child health outcomes (secondary). Strategies we will compare include (1) SAGE (garden + online curriculum + materials box) vs. SAGE plus e-support implementation package (text messages + newsletters + hotline), (2) SAGE with no in person support and training vs. SAGE with in person support and training, and (3) SAGE usual activities vs. SAGE with a ECE virtual learning collaborative to share SAGE implementation experiences and strategies with other ECE sites and community partners. We will (Aim 1) apply the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify inner and outer setting characteristics that hinder or facilitate SAGE implementation to tailor support strategies for local context; (Aim 2) use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to analyze SAGE implementation strategy components to determine the most efficient and effective combination of strategies across contexts; and (Aim 3) investigate costs that may influence implementation strategies and their effect on locomotor skills and nutrition effectiveness outcomes. In Aim 1 (MOST screening), we will measure ECE site and teacher characteristics via an in person visual assessment and a teacher and director survey (inner setting). We will also neighborhood characteristics and complete a social network analysis of ECE personnel. With this information we will use an implementation mapping process to collaboratively develop and finalize implementation strategies. In Aim 2 (MOST refine), 40 existing SAGE ECE sites will be pair matched by degree of individual implementation and site characteristics (size, enrollment) assessed in aim 1, and assigned to one of eight implementation strategy combinations to a full factorial model. Sites will be assessed at the beginning and ending of the academic year with site audits, parent and teacher surveys, and non-invasive child fitness, veggiemeter and eating in the absence of hunger measures. For Aim 3, (MOST refine) cost effectiveness ratio for each of the strategies will be calculated from a payer and societal perspective to determine which implementation strategy or combination of strategies may be most scalable. Results will help inform decisions about garden and curriculum implementation strategies that can be scaled to underserved communities.   ",

FP00035010,849,,,,,1,,,"Statement of work for SNAP program: This proposal builds upon ASUs significant experience in sample collection, analysis, and biomarker identification. ASU will participate in two tasks: 1.0 Saliva collection: During pandemic Dr. Murugan spearheaded an effort to establish a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited ASU Biodesign Clinical Testing Laboratory (ABCTL). Currently ABCTL has the capabilities to perform >20k molecular diagnostic tests/day and >1000 serology tests/day. ABCTL was one of the first in the nation to introduce saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing, in a drive-thru format for the public starting June 01, 2020. Since then, ABCTL collected, tested, and reported 1.44M SARS-CoV-2 tests with an average turnaround time (TAT) of <28 hours, and >44,000 SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequences, with variant/clades/subclades information. ABCTL developed a throughput automated sample processing workflow with minimal human intervention to achieve increased throughput and reduce any errors. Our updated saliva collection method using a simple straw significantly improved the automation, reduced the number of invalid tests from 30% to <1%. Initially participants were asked to give a saliva specimen in a cup or a 5 mL tube directly. Specimens received at the laboratory, had different viscosity, many of them with sputum, phlegm etc that made it difficult for the liquid handler to operate, and produced >30% invalid tests. We also tested multiple methods to liquify the saliva, both physical and enzymatic disruption using papain before processing. Finally, introduction of a simple straw and requiring the participants to spit through the straw improved sample quality and forced participants to provide a plain, liquid portion of the saliva. SNAP program requires saliva that can flow through lateral flow without any blockage. We will test and develop an improved saliva collection straw that can be integrated into the device. 1.1 Develop saliva collection system: 1.1.1  Test multiple filters and identify the best filter that works with lateral flow system. We will test multiple syringe-based filters with varying pore size to identify the best filter that works for the downstream applications. It is possible that we may need a sequential filtration built within the same straw to mitigate any clogging by food particles. 1.1.2  Fabricate an optimal saliva collection straw: ASU will fabricate a straw with appropriate filets (as identified in 1.1.1 above) that can be utilized and integrated into the system by IOS. 2. Integrated multiomic biomarker search, identification and down selection through multi-task and multi-label learning-based algorithm: We have extensive experience identifying biomarkers from large omics data sets and developing a complex algorithm to estimate dose and time of exposure gained from performance on a BARDA-funded radiation biodosimetry effort. Using our techniques, we were able to accurately diagnose radiation exposure between 0-10 Gy (with sensitivity and specificity), up to 7 days (time-resolved) post exposure. The key innovation of our approach is the use of transcriptomics data to ensure that we select epigenetic markers that have functional consequencesi.e., to distinguish silent (passenger) changes from the effectors (drivers) within the potentially heterogeneous and noisy gene expression changes among the exposed populations. 2.1 Literature curation to identify multiomic datasets: 2.1.1 Curate and download publicly available datasets. 2.1.2 Develop methods to normalize to reduce any variations (Batch effects) across the datasets and identify differentially enriched biomarkers between control and experimental groups. 2.1.3 Create a local database of processed datasets for sharing across IOS team and V&V partners 2.2 Biomarker identification and down selection: 2.2.1 Identifying Biomarkers: From the list of differentially regulated epigenetic features for each exposure, we aim to identify up to 100 predictive markers that are validated, among which any markers confounded by age, ethnicity, medications, and prevalent health conditions will be eliminated. During the predictive model training and feature selection process, we will down select them further to an optimal number that can predict exposures with maximum specificity, sensitivity, and time resolution, as well as with minimum resource requirements for translation to a Point of Care(POC)/Lateral Flow setting. 2.2.2 Filtering out confounded epigenetic features. From the initial lists of differential epigenetic features, we will filter out difficult-to-measure and non-informative variables with low values or low variance between the sample groups and identify potential confounders of epigenetic features using extensive mining and curation of public datasets. We will collect and analyze datasets from the public databases, GEO/SRA databases, and publications for various demographics, prevalent diseases (based on CDC statistics), common medication (e.g., statins), lifestyles (e.g., smoking and stress), and environmental exposures. Confounded features (FDR < 0.05) with combined prevalence of >10% will be filtered out in the final list of signatures.

FP00035065,852,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  Critical aspects to preventing and managing chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are an appropriate management of dietary intake and exercise. Although wearable sensors have been used for exercise monitoring, the utility of these technologies has remained limited in impact in diet monitoring and intervention. Current diet monitoring technologies are prone to measurement errors and have a participant data  entry  burden.  They  fail  to  account  for  human  cognitive  limitations  and  are  constrained  in  accuracy because of challenges in identifying ingredients. Furthermore, they do not utilize the information about dietary intake for personalized interventions. The increase in prevalence of continuous glucose monitors, coupled with wearable smartwatches and wristbands, has enabled the monitoring and evaluation of dietary intake by monitoring the post-prandial glucose response to meals and personal modeling of macronutrient composition from the signals captured. However, there remain gaps in knowledge about how to improve accuracy and timeliness of diet monitoring and nutrition information, how to design such algorithms for use in free-living environments, and how to use the information provide by these systems to aid glucose control. To address these  knowledge  gaps,  our  monitoring  of  post-prandial  glucose  responses,  as  measured  by  continuous glucose monitors, along with physiological data captured from wearables, provides the necessary data to interpret  dietary  intake  in  ambulatory  environments.  Furthermore,  our machine  learning  and  optimization algorithms provide actionable forecasting outcomes to prevent hyperglycemic events and to assist in healthy eating.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  the  unique  combination  of  behavioral  and  physiological  information  with wearable sensing, as proposed in this application, can provide daily identification of meal intake components that lead to elevated glucose levels, elevated glucose variability, and extreme hyperglycemia. To achieve these goals, we will design machine learning algorithms and analytical methods that estimate dietary intake using multimodal physiological data and examines the interplay between diet and exercise in Aim 1. The techniques will be evaluated using data that we will collect from 45 prediabetic people as well as historical data with 30 prediabetic persons from our prior studies. Using the data collected in Aim 1, we will develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms that predict impending hyperglycemia from multimodal data about diet,  health,  and  context  in  Aim  2.  In  Aim  3,  we  will  develop  sequential  decision-making  algorithms  that provide personalized feedback about healthy eating options considering a persons diet habit and diet goals. We will assess the feasibility of our innovative diet-based intervention technique in a clinical trial involving 68 prediabetic people. The proposed research is significant because it will provide the foundation for radically new tools for the prevention and self-management of a wide range of chronic conditions.  ",

[3] Enhancing the existing N-PHAM tool through the refinement of the existing statistical models to estimate these features' collective impact (along with other larger-scale walkability metrics) on travel, physical activity, greenhouse gases and household energy expenditure. The modeling work will include the use of person-level household travel survey data for selected regions.Marc A. Adams, PhD, MPH was selected to perform this work because of his published work to develop and validate a novel method of measuring pedestrian environment features (e.g., sidewalks, sidewalk buffers, crosswalks) using computer vision. He is an expert in the physical activity field as it relates to the moderating impacts of built environment features on physical interventions. Dr. Adams completed a NIH-funded R01 study testing a physical activity intervention to increase objective and reported physical activity and improve health outcomes across high and low walkability neighborhoods. Importantly this NIH-funded study supported a supplement grant to develop the computer vision models to be utilized in the current application.

FP00035123,855,,,,,1,,,"Justification. The incidence of gallbladder cancer (GbCa) in US is 1.4/100,000 in women and 0.8/100,000 in men,1 falling under the CDMRP rare cancers definition (<6/100,000). GbCa, the most frequent malignancy of the biliary tract, occurs in a non-sex organ with a doubled incidence rate in women than in men and presents one of the greatest racial disparities of cancers:2-5 with American Indian and/or Native Alaskan (AIAN) people at a 6-fold incidence and 8-fold mortality rate than both rates in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). GbCa is extremely fatal due to late stage diagnosis, and is among the minority of cancers presenting a greater proportion of mortality than incidence: its incidence accounts for 1.2% of all cancer diagnoses, but mortality for 1.7% of all cancer deaths.1Hypotheses. First of our two hypotheses is that gallstone disease (GSD) is the top one contributor to GbCa and delays in diagnosis and treatment for both GSD and GbCa significantly contribute to the racial disparity in GbCa mortality. Our second hypothesis is that analysis of multi-modal molecular data, genomics and metabolomics, will enable us to identifying disease-defining molecular pathways involved sex disparity in GSD, contributing to sex disparity in GbCa. Novel and powerful Machine Learning algorithms such as Deep Learning/Artificial Intelligence will supplement classical Machine Learning and Statistical modeling to provide improved analytical results. The identification of molecular biomarkers and pathways, in conjunction with well annotated clinical data from Electronic Health Record (EHR) provided by our colleagues from Mayo Clinic and Sangre Por Salud Biobank will help develop and validate rare tumor-specific models that can support clinical trial readiness.Objectives and Specific Aims. Our objective is to provide evidence for a sex- and race-specific, prioritized strategy for identifying biological pathways that will promote early detection and reduced GSD morbidity and GbCa mortality. Our proposed project has two analytic aims, one will characterize race and sex disparity in top three risk factors contributing to GbCa disease burden, and another will combine genome-wide and metabolome-wide data to explore biological signatures associated with gallstones, a hallmark of GbCa,6 as follows.Aim 1.  We will establish a feasible method for testing our hypothesis-1 that delays in diagnosis and treatment significantly contribute to the racial disparity in GbCa mortality. Specifically, we will answer 5 questions in 5 subaims: whether the intervals between diagnosis and treatment of GSD, diabetes (DM), dyslipidemia and GbCa differ among AIAN, NHW, and Hispanic White (HW) patients (Aim-1a); in GbCa patients, whether the intervals between diagnosis of GSD or DM and treatment of GbCa differ among AIAN, NHW, and HW patients (Aim-1b); whether types of GbCa treatment differ among AIAN, NHW, and HW patients (Aim 1c); whether the patterns observed in Aims 1a-1c vary among areas in Arizona (AZ), particularly counties with higher AIAN and HW people (Aim 1d); and whether target hospitals and communities can be identified for next-step engagement to further investigate barriers that contribute to the observed disparities (Aim 1e).  Aim 2. We will apply powerful Deep Machine Learning algorithms in conjunction with classical Machine Learning and Statistical analysis to provide improved analysis results.  This study will take advantage of a unique repository based in Arizona, Sangre Por Salud (SPS) biobank, with access to genome-wide variant data for 3,717 Latinx individuals and plasma samples for the metabolomics investigation in this study. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine metabolomic and genome-wide variant data to investigate the molecular factors contributing to the wide sexual disparity between women and men for the burden of GSD.",

FP00035166,858,,,,,1,,,"Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare (~1/2M) human genetic disease characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) of soft connective tissues eventually resulting in untimely death. The R206H ACVR1/ALK2 variant, causative for >97% of FOP mutations, conveys receptor neofunction where activin ligand activates rather than inhibits ACVR1, leading to upregulated BMP signaling.  Although elegant in vivo mouse and in vitro tissue culture models for human FOP have provided significant insight over the years, a complete, detailed knowledge and understanding of molecular signaling pathways contributing to HO in FOP remain to be fully elucidated.  Furthermore, HO is a common health issue associated with injury, aging and genetic diseases, and can have serious and significant deleterious effects on the health, lifestyle and longevity of affected individuals. Thus, the proposed studies are a significant health concern and priority. Better understanding of mechanisms regulating FOP ACVR1 variants is needed to develop more effective treatment therapies for FOP and for HO in general.  This knowledge will also improve Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (TERM) therapies to regenerate bone in a controlled and rapid manner.To fill current knowledge gaps, the studies proposed here will use 1) in vitro FOP patient derived dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), and 2) in vivo zebrafish FOP models, to further define FOP ACVR1 variant signaling pathways in FOP.  Rationale for the proposed studies includes the significant need to establish better in vivo animal models to study a variety of human diseases including FOP, and the demonstrated utility of zebrafish for this purpose.  The long-term goal of our research is to develop new, targeted therapies to prevent and/or treat human FOP, to control unwanted HO, and to identify improved methods for bone regeneration. The objective of this five-year R01 is to use FOP patient derived DPSCs and zebrafish FOP models to define new mechanisms and signaling pathways contributing to FOP.  The proposed studies are significant in that they address the serious health issue of HO, which occurs in FOP and many other genetic, age and injury related diseases, and may also lead to more effective bone regeneration strategies.  Aim 1.  Define and compare the molecular and cellular profiles of FOP and WT DPSCs.Rationale:  Although it is virtually impossible to obtain human FOP patient tissue samples due to the unwanted risk of injury induced HO, FOP patients do exfoliate their baby teeth providing access to soft tissue dental pulp that can be used to establish primary cell lines. Approach:  We will use our extensive published expertise to characterize and compare FOP patient and normal DPSCs, focusing on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and immunomodulatory signaling.  We will use single cell approaches to define key signatures of differentiating FOP derived DPSC populations as compared to age matched WT DPSCs.  We will also define key metabolomics signatures that may provide insight into new therapeutic targets for FOP patients. Aim 2. Define mechanisms regulating human ACVR1 R206H and zebrafish Acvr1l R203H activity. Rationale: While human Q207D ACVR1 and zebrafish Q204D Acvr1 both exhibit upregulated BMP signaling, human R206H shows upregulated BMP signaling while zebrafish R203H does not. This curious result suggests that amino acid differences between zebrafish and human Acvr1l/ACVR1 mediate R203H resilience to activation. Approach: We will establish a platform consisting of in silico structural modeling coupled with functional testing in an embryonic zebrafish ventralization assay to identify and functionally characterize differential signaling in human and zebrafish ACVR1 R206H/Acvr1l R203H variants. We will perform 3D structural modeling of human R206H and zebrafish R203H receptor variants, along with their FKBP inhibitors, and then use targeted genome editing and functional in vitro (DPSC cultures) and in vivo (embryonic zebrafish dorso/ventral patterning) studies, to define functional amino acids mediating human and zebrafish receptor activities.  We will also use this platform to inform small molecule screens to block human ACVR1 R206H signaling. At the completion of the proposed Specific Aims, we expect to have established and validated new therapeutic targets to block human FOP ACVR1 R206H signaling.  The proposed studies are innovative in that they will use FOP patient derived dental pulp stem cell lines and newly created FOP zebrafish models to interrogate FOP signaling pathways.  The proposed studies are significant in that they will improve understanding of R206H ACVR1 variant signaling and provide new experimental tools to continue to further our understanding. The anticipated impact of the proposed studies is high, based on the published expertise of the investigative team and the proposed innovative and rational approaches.",
FP00035185,859,,,,,1,,,"Apolipoprotein e4 variant (ApoE4) is a significant genetic risk factor for many aging-related neurological diseases, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). However, ApoE4 alone does not necessarily lead to pathogenesis, suggesting that environmental risk factors could interact with the ApoE4 gene to fully explain the etiology. Cadmium (Cd) is an emerging heavy metal neurotoxicant, and strong evidence supports that early life Cd exposure causes neurological problems later in life. Interestingly, we recently provided direct evidence of the ApoE4-Cd gene-environment interaction, which has established the groundwork for further mechanistic studies. Both ApoE genetics and Cd induce gut microbiome dysbiosis, a key component along the gut-brain axis (GBA) that is a communication pathway vitally important to brain function and illness. Using ApoE3/E4-KI mice, we unveiled that Cd-induced gut dysbiosis was uniquely regulated by the host ApoE genotype, and interestingly, the ApoE4-Cd interaction significantly upregulated circulating levels of propionate that was previously known to be essential along the GBA. However, as stated in this PAR-21-253, a vast majority of microbial metabolites remain unknown, and more importantly, causal associations between the gut microbiota and host metabolism are largely undetermined. To address these fundamental knowledge gaps, we hypothesize that early life Cd exposure causes persistent gut microbiome dysbiosis as well as dysregulated levels of metabolites and lipids along the GBA, which is an ApoE4-dependent and druggable contributor to the neurotoxic susceptibility later in life. The overall objectives of this collaborative study are 1) to identify and characterize a wide range of novel and bioactive microbial metabolites and lipids along the GBA using metagenomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics approaches, and 2) to establish a mechanistic and causal role among early life Cd exposure, gut microbiome dysbiosis, metabolic/lipid dysregulation along the GBA, and ApoE4-dependent neurotoxicity. In Aim 1, we will characterize early life Cd exposure-induced gut microbiome dysbiosis as a key intermediate in ApoE4-dependent neurotoxic phenotypes later in life. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanistic role of metabolism along the GBA in early life Cd exposure-induced ApoE4-dependent neurotoxicity later in life. In Aim 3, we will Determine how (A) gut microbiome transplant and (B) metabolites/lipids specific of a healthy gut modify ApoE4-dependent neurotoxic effects from early life Cd exposure. This proposal aligns well with the purpose of PAR-21-253 in that our results will significantly contribute to a knowledgebase of microbial metabolites/lipids and associated functions, which will be of wide interest to the research community. We will provide strong insights into how early life Cd exposure mechanistically interacts with the brain. Our results may also facilitate novel precision intervention paradigms for neurological diseases among populations with high risk of Cd exposure, especially those children in the US (long-term goal).",

Such changes can be facilitatedby new technologies that monitor behaviors related to diet and activity. In response to the NIHExploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program (Parent R21 Clinical Trial Required) (PA-20-194), whichcalls for novel scientific ideas, model systems, tools, agents, targets, and technologies, an improved methodfor tracking an individuals energy imbalance is proposed that focuses exclusively and innovatively on fat mass.Regular weight measurement is strongly linked to both successful weight loss and weight maintenance (e.g.,avoidance of weight gain). Such feedback is critical as it can provide early warning of upward weight trends andreinforcing feedback concerning downward trends or maintenance of an appropriate body weight. A commonfrustration in taking frequent weight measurements, however, is that in the short term, most weight variationis due to changes in water balance. With regard to weight management, such changes represent noise fromwhich the true trend in weight can be extracted and used to gauge actual progress with respect to weight goals.Herein, an improved method for tracking an individuals energy imbalance is proposed that is centered exclusivelyon fat mass (FM), which is the key quantity that should be individuals central focus in weight management.That is, the key quantity of interest concerning body weight (W) is anhydrous FM, which largely eliminateswater noise; increases in fat-free mass (FFM) and bone mass (BM) are generally considered to be desirable.The proposed R21 effort will assess WeighTrak, a novel weight management approach that integrates theavailable consumer-grade body composition (BC) scale measurements  e.g., W, FM%, FFM%, BM%, and/ortotal body water percentage (TBW%)  via unscented particle filtering (UPF). The UPF can approximate theideal Bayesian estimator even when the modeled system is nonlinear and/or has non-Gaussian noise properties.Optimal processing of BC scale measurements will enable more precise feedback of energy imbalance, minimizingvariations due to changes in TBW, FFM, and BM, which will then be presented to users in units of Calories(i.e., kilocalories) rather than pounds or percentages; such feedback is expected to be more meaningful to usersand result in better weight management. Obese individuals who wish to lose 3-5% of their body weight willbe enrolled into a 3-month physical activity and dietary training program. Successful individuals will then berandomized into two weight maintenance groups that receive different types of feedback over 12 months. Group1 will receive feedback based on changes in W (lbs/day) plus a graph of cumulative W (lbs) changes v. time anda maintenance W (lbs) reference line. Group 2 will receive feedback based on the UPF-computed changes inFM (Calories/day) along with a graph of cumulative FM (Calories) changes v. time and a zero Calorie changereference line. Statistical testing for differences in the maintenance groups FM values will then be performed.",

FP00035299,862,,,,,1,,,"Background: Firefighters have increased cancer rates compared to the general population, as recently determined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization. Cardiovascular disease is also a leading cause of firefighter deaths. A major concern of the Arizona fire service is exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the so-called forever chemicals based on their persistence in the human body and environment. PFAS exposures have been linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease and other diseases. We have previously shown that Arizona firefighters have higher PFAS levels in their blood than the general population. Arizona firefighters are requesting a study to test the effectiveness of blood or plasma donation to lower their PFAS levels, based on a single previous study in Australia demonstrating these interventions were effective in lowering PFAS levels over 12 months of time. However, the study did not determine if these interventions also reduced the risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Having a cellular biological clock greater than ones chronological age (years since birth), measured through blood DNA methylation markers, is a risk factor for multiple diseases including cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases, as well as death from all causes combined. We have previously shown that firefighters with increased serum PFAS levels also have biological clocks greater than their chronological age. Arizona firefighters are also interested in reducing their cancer and cardiovascular disease risks even if they do not have elevated PFAS levels and have expressed interest in testing a variety of interventions with these outcomes in mind.Goal: The goal of this research is to reduce firefighter cancer and cardiovascular disease risks, including but not limited to risks associated with PFAS exposure.",
FP00035364,863,,,,,1,,,"Infectious disease spread within the human population can be conceptualized as a complex system composed of individuals that interact and transmit viruses via spatiotemporal processes that manifest across and between scales. The complexity of this system ultimately means that infectious disease spread is difficult to understand, predict, and effectively respond to. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved impressive results in other learning and prediction tasks, but have not yet been widely applied to epidemic prediction and preparedness. This lack of pervasion of AI methods in this domain may be contributed to the lack of explainability of common ``black box'' AI solutions. In particular, AI methods are known to amplify the bias in the data they are trained on, problematic in infectious disease models which leverage large open and inherently biased spatiotemporal data. These biases may propagate through the modeling pipeline to decision making, resulting in inequitable policy interventions. In this CSIRO-NSF collaborative project, our goal is to investigate how the AI disease modeling pipeline can lead to biased predictions and to derive solutions that mitigate this bias. Towards this goal, our team will 1) investigate an AI solution that captures spatio-temporal heterogeneity for infectious disease spread prediction using large sets of available human mobility and disease case data, 2) use agent-based simulation as a sandbox to control the bias in a variety of data sets, 3) evaluate how existing solution for fairness in AI are able to mitigate this bias and investigate novel solutions for fairness in AI.

FP00035367,864,,,,,1,,,"Mutations in ASXL3 cause Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome (BRS), a rare disease estimated to affectapproximately 150-200 people world-wide. Work on BRS so far has primarily focused on describing casestudies since its discovery almost 10 years ago. Children with BRS present with neurodevelopmental andpsychomotor delay as evidenced by intellectual disability, speech impairment, neuro-behavioral issues, feedingdifficulties and failure to thrive. They also display characteristic facial features. Mutations are not usuallyinherited from parents. ASXL3 encodes a protein containing 2248 amino acids which is largely predicted to bedisordered with the exception of a HTH HARE-type, a DEUBAD and an atypical PHD-type Zinc-finger domain.We propose that DNA binding through the Zinc-finger domain is critical for its function and domain deletioncauses BRS. It is the goal of this proposal to lay the foundation for future studies exploring the molecularconsequences of abolished DNA binding and linkage with BRS symptoms in patients through genotypephenotype mapping. To enable testing the hypothesis that WT ASXL3 binds to DNA and that the ASXL3-Zincfinger deletion mutant does not bind to DNA, we will express and purify the ASXL3 gene with and withoutdeletion, as well as the Zinc-finger domain alone, through transient transfection of HEK293 cells. DNA bindingspecificity will be predicted and experimentally validated through gel shift assays. This in vitro system will beused to find the minimum deletion needed to detect a clear functional readout. To enable connecting genotypeto phenotype, we will establish a mouse model for BRS C57BL6/J mice using the minimum deletion identifiedin vitro. This region in ASXL3 will be deleted and the behavioral and neuronal phenotypes of affected mice willbe studied through established tests of intellectual disability and speech impairment. Ultimately, we wish toconnect our in vitro and animal model studies to generating hypotheses as to the role different mutations playin the severity of symptoms experienced by BRS patients. To begin this process, we propose to analyze indetail patient symptoms from literature and from our own case studies. The cell and animal model system willestablish the basis to study interactions of ASXL3 with genes associated with speech and hearing impairmentto allow us to derive future specific hypotheses on the molecular mechanism underlying BRS.",

FP00035574,867,,,,,1,,,"4.1 Specific Aims Principal Investigator: Chang, John C. A. According to Aging in Arizona report published in 2014, Arizonas population is set to double to 11 million by 2050 while the population older than 65 will triple to 2.5 million [1].This will lead to an increase in age-related diseases, which include cancers such as colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic ductal (PDAC) adenocarcinomas, both of which have average age of diagnosis between 68-70 [2, 3].CRC also has rising incidence for population younger than 50 years leading to recent lowering of screening age to 45[2, 3]. CRC and PDAC have vague symptoms  early  in  their  course  with  patients  seeking  care  through  their  primary  care  and/or  emergency physicians. These visits usually lead to CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) where 40-70% of the subtle features of CRC or PDAC are initially missed, leading to delay in diagnosis and worse clinical outcomes[4, 5]. Since prompt treatment is the key to best patient outcome, improving the diagnosis of these early malignancies could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. The most effective method of improving early diagnosis is through a second-observer, but for economic reasons, human-based second-observers are impractical. Artificial-intelligence-based second-observer (AI-observer) can potentially fulfill this clinical need in abdominal imaging, as demonstrated in breast imaging (Hologic ImageChecker and Quantra CAD). Our pilot AI-observer trained with a UNet architecture using 31 million parameters shows promise in detecting CRC even with limited number of training cases (80% sensitivity) but produces a large number of false positives (21 per case). Our goal in this proposal is to develop methods for decreasing false positives while maintaining high sensitivity by integrating clinical information and using transparent and detailed training cases.  Aim 1: We will test the hypothesis that the AI-observer can maintain high sensitivity of detecting CRC while lowering the false positive rate by including patient clinical information. In this aim, we will compare the sensitivity, specificity, false positives per case, and Dice coefficient between AI models trained using strictly CT images, CT images and independently weighted clinical information, and CT images and ensemble-weighted clinical information.  The clinical information includes routine laboratory study (LD), clinical history and physical examination (H&P), and family medical history (FMH) from a clinical visit within 2 months of imaging study. We will randomly select 10% and 20% of the 300 cancer, 150 confounding, and 500 normal cases for validation and testing purposes while the remaining 70% will be for training. This will repeat until sensitivity and specificity reach 85% (or when false positives decrease to less than 5 per case while sensitivity remains above 85%) for the test cases. This allows us to assess whether additional clinical information will further improve AI-observer outcome and  determine  which  method  of  information  integration  will  be  most  effective  at  improving  AI-observer performance.  Collection of additional cancer, confounding, and normal cases will be on-going through the project, beyond the currently available 289 CRC cases, of which 141 have been annotated with CRC on the CT images.   Aim  2:  We  will  test  the  hypothesis  that  our  pilot  CRC  AI-observer  can  improve  the  detection  with transparent and detailed training. In this aim, we will compare the model sensitivity, specificity, false positives per case, and Dice coefficient between models trained with varying proportion of late stage CRC (stages 3&4), early stage CRC (stages 1&2), confounding (diverticulitis, colitis, or enteritis), and normal (may include cysts in liver or kidneys) cases.  We will continue to gather cases throughout the project to achieve at least 100cases of stage 1&2 CRC, 200 stage 3&4 CRC, 150 confounding, and 500 normal cases. The breakdown of training ratios is listed in Table 1 of the Research Plan.  10 and 20% of the cases will be allocated for testing and validation purposes.  This aim tests the influence of training case imbalance on model performance. The segmentation outcome of the AI-observers trained with different case ratios will also be tested using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC cases. We aim to achieve a sensitivity and specificity of 85% for our internal test cases (or when false positives per case decrease to less than 5 per case while sensitivity remains above 85%).   Discovery Boost Grant Application  January 2022  4.2 Principal Investigator: Chang, John C. B. Significance Issues in Delayed and Missed Cancer Diagnosis: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and lethal cancer with average age of diagnosis between 68 to 70 [2, 3]. As Arizona is expected to triple in size of those older than 65 by 2050, these cancers can impact the health of this group [1].Unfortunately, early CRC is difficult to diagnose in  early  stages  because  of  vague  clinical  presentation[4,  5].This  problem  is  exacerbated  by  the  increasing incidence of CRC in younger patient (< 50) where clinical suspicion for cancer is low [6].These factors result in delayed diagnosis and greater morbidity and mortality for the patients. In the lead-up to the diagnosis, patients have  visited  their  primary  care  (PCP)  or  emergency  department  (ED) physicians  multiple  times,  resulting  in advanced cross-sectional imaging [7-9].Even with the best screening guidelines and health insurance, 40% of CRC remains diagnosed in the ED, 70% of which had prior consultations regarding these vague symptoms [7, 8].When imaging studies were ordered after these consultations, the early features of CRC are often overlooked in up to 30-40% fork cases [5].This delay results in significant decrease in 5-year survival in CRC [5].Thus, missing early CRC on routine computed tomography (CT) scan is a significant unresolved problem that leads to significant morbidity for patients.   Options  for  Improving  Detection  of  Overlooked  Early  Cancer  in  Routine  CTAP:  Although  computed tomography colonography (CTC) is a reliable way to detect early CRC compared to CT of abdomen and pelvis (CTAP), the technique has limited application due to the need for colon clean-out, which takes 24 hours to conduct, and requires dedicated insufflator and reading software, making this technique more applicable for scheduled outpatient screening rather than acute or routine abdominal imaging [10].However, radiology studies since 1949 have shown consistent rate of missing radiologic findings[11].The increased use and complexity of the modern imaging studies lead to a disproportionate misdiagnosis related to cancer than other benign findings in  the  screening  and  acute  settings  [12-19].Many  potential  solutions  have  been  proposed  to  remedy misdiagnosis, with the real-time second observer being the most effective [20, 21].Although a human second-observer is economically impractical, a computer-assisted detection (CADe) algorithm makes a real-time second observer  economically  and  clinically  viable,  as  implemented  for  screening  mammography  and  for  retinal hemorrhages [22-26].Therefore, developing a CADe second observer has the potential of improving early CRC diagnosis on CTAP. Methods for Implementing CADe Second Observer: Many versions of CADe for detecting various imaging abnormalities  have  been  implemented  using  parametric  or  nonparametric  approaches[27].Parametric techniques classify lesions based on their curvature or density achieving sensitivity in the range of 40-100% and specificity in the range of 70-90%[28-30].Nonparametric techniques that include AI with convolutional neural networks  (CNN)have  outperformed  parametric  techniques  in  multiple  imaging  competitions,  including  brain tumor segmentation and ImageNet challenges [31].AI-second observers have been developed to detect breast lesions from breast ultrasound, intracranial hemorrhage from routine head CT, PDAC from pancreatic CT, rectal cancer  on  3D  rectal  MRI,  and perirectal lymph nodes on rectal MRI [32-36].Of these, AI-second observer intracranial hemorrhage have shortened the time to diagnosis for patients with intracranial  hemorrhage  while the  remaining  observers  still require  clinical  validation  or significant technical improvement[32-36]. Issues Implementing  AI-Second  Observers  for  CTAP: There are multiple unique issues with  CTAP  that  can  pose  significant  challenges  for  successfully  training  an  AI-second  observer.  The  first important issue is the variation in images that arises from varying protocol (including contrast use, contrast timing, slice thickness, and reconstruction techniques), the variation in bowel contents (feces and fluid ) , the variation Discovery Boost Grant Application  January 2022  Figure 1. Varied Appearance of Different CRC and Confounding Disease.  A) Enhancing colorectal polyp. B) Asymmetric wall thickening. C) Ill-defined circumferential wall CRC. D) Wall edema from enterocolitis. White arrows point to the site of disease.  for in C A B  Principal Investigator: Chang, John C. 4.3 of bowel across different ages and body habitus (including rotation of the small bowel, length of the colon, and the amount of visceral fat between bowel segments), the presence of confounding diseases such as diverticulitis or enterocolitis (Figure 1), and the variation of cancer stage (from small polyp to wall-thickening with pericolonic infiltration) (Figure 1).Another important issue is whether AI-second observer developed to detect one disease can  successfully  detect  other  diseases.  These  two  issues  pose  potential  roadblocks  to  AI-second  observer success in detecting CRC and form the basis of our proposed research. We aim to address the issue of colon variability on imaging using our collected CRC cases in our database. The cases that we have collected are from various radiological groups in the Phoenix and Houston metropolitan area (6 unique groups with varying imaging protocol and contrast use) and possess varying body habitus (currently classifying) which allows us to control for variability in imaging protocol and patient body habitus. We will further control confounding disease with inclusion of these diseases in the training process and the varying cancer stage with inclusion of early and late  cancer  cases).  This  differs  from  other  reported  AI  research  where  collected  data  is  nearly homogeneous. Methods for Improving AI-Second Observer: Several methods have been proposed to improve the detection rates of AI-second observers. Multimodal techniques integrating genomic and radiomic information for predicting lung cancer survival have shown promise that additional medical history can lower the uncertainty of the final prediction[37].In the diagnostic setting for CRC, potentially useful information to lower uncertainty includes red blood cell volume (LD), family medical history (FMH), and patients own medical history and physical examination (H&P) [38].Although each piece of information adds incremental value, it is unknown which combination of these data can optimize the outcome of the AI-second observer, as some data may or may not improve (or even subtract from) model outcome [39, 40].Another method for improving the AI-second observer is through transfer learning. By pretraining the model on other image database, some of the learned knowledge is transferrable to a new task, although pretraining for actual application is required [41].The transfer learning provides incremental improvement in outcome but could possess hidden properties that have not been directly explored [41]. A third method is through varying the contextual information by varying of amount surrounding normal tissue included for  training  [42,  43].    This  technique  improves  the  accuracy  of  classification  when  low  false  positive  rate  is required  [42,  43].    Another  technique  to  improve  model  accuracy  is  by  hard  example  mining  [44].    In  this technique, a portion of easy training cases (correctly classified case) is replaced by hard examples, ones that previously caused false positive identification, so as to stretch the model parameters to improve the recognition of false positive features [44].  Lastly, imbalanced learning can create model bias and skew detection toward major classes, an effect that occurs with both classical and deep learning technique [45-47].  We aim to improve our  CRC  AI-observer  by  incorporating  clinical  information  using  an  ensemble  model  and  by  clear training ratio of cases between cancer, confounding, and normal cases. The goal of the proposed research is to improve the detection rates and patient outcomes of CRC by developing a real-time AI-second observer to detect both early- and late-stages of CRC on routine CTAP commonly obtained in emergency and outpatient imaging clinics. We will (1) design novel ensemble algorithms for training AI models incorporating a combination of imaging and clinical information and (2)  develop  a  standardized  training  template  to  improve  model  transparency.  The  inherent  imaging variability in our CRC cases will prevent over-fitting of cases and allow generalization of the model to cases from other centers.  By improving the early detection of cancers, we can potentially improve the 5-year survival and resection rates for these cancers [4, 5].  C. Innovation  As described previously, this project is innovative in developing a technology based solution to decrease medical errors in the imaging space which is non-existent in the marketplace for CRC. This seeks to challenge the current paradigm that medical errors are best improved through peer review rather than concurrent consultation.  The  proposed  solution  can  improve  the  outcomes  of  Arizonans  and  patients  harboring undiagnosed cancer. Our innovative approach will develop a large, annotated imaging and clinical history database (first in the literature) for exploring two less understood aspects of AI model development: 1) effects of imbalanced training on model outcome and 2) exploring the improvements obtainable from Discovery Boost Grant Application  January 2022  B A Model eline Cases Model A CT Scan  Algorithm ProjectTimValidation Normal Cases Training Masks Principal Investigator: Chang, John C. 4.4 incorporating clinical history to AI image interpretation. These discoveries are expected to lead to advances in  the  AI  training  and  decision  making  processes  which  will  lower  medical  errors  and  improve  healthcare efficiency and patient outcome for CRC patients. This will lead to future clinical trial to quantify the impact of early detection on subsequent patient survival.  Successful implementation of this novel algorithm will also improve the CRC outcome of underserved population where there is a lack of expert body radiologists.   D. Preliminary Studies Our  initial  results  using  a limited training  dataset show promise for a reliable AI  second  observer to detect early stages of CRC. We applied the UNet CNN architecture for CRC tumor segmentation (Figure 2A)[34]. The key advantage of  CNN  learning  is  that  it automatically  learns  visual features  distinctive  for  the task. However, since CNNs have  a  large  number  of learnable  parameters  (~31 million  parameters  in  the applied large, annotated training datasets are  often  necessary for reliable CNN learning. With limited training data, the model parameters that allow the CNN to make correct predictions for the training data are often not unique. For more reliable CNN learning and for a more comprehensive evaluation of how the CNN performs, we applied the deep ensemble technique (Figure 2B) [48]. To apply the deep ensemble approach, five CNN models were trained independently with random initialization using the same CNN architect and the same training data. Given a testing CT scan, each of the five trained CNN models was applied to produce tumor segmentation for the testing CT scan. The tumor segmentation results produced by the trained CNN models were then fused using simple voting rule to produce consensus tumor segmentation results. The data used in our preliminary study were collected from two sources: a private dataset collected at Banner and  MD  Anderson  in  Houston  and  a  public  dataset  downloaded  from  The  Cancer  Genome  Atlas  Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD) data collection. The private dataset includes CT scans for 58 CRC patients and 59 normal subjects. The TCGA dataset includes CT scans for 25 CRC patients. The tumor masks were manually traced in CT scans for each patient. 7 annotated patient scans were randomly selected from the private dataset as validation data for training. The remaining private dataset were used as training data. The TCGA data were used for testing the performance of the learned tumor segmentation model.  Figure 2. Preliminary CNN models.

Detection Outcome of Preliminary Ensemble Learning I  IA B CN CTAP CTAP  Our initial data show that an AI model can be properly trained even when some of the tumor images are not included. When we tested the ensemble learning model, it dramatically improved the false positive/case at the cost of a slight decrease in sensitivity (Figure 3). The preliminary results emphasize that AI can serve as a second observer but demonstrate room for significant improvement. E. Research Design Methods for Aim 1. We will test the hypothesis that the AI-observer can maintain high sensitivity of detecting CRC while lowering the false positive rate by including patient clinical information. We will train CNN of several different architectures to compare whether a multimodal technique improves detection over a standard observer trained on CTAP images only (S-CTAP).The standard observer will be trained using an UNet architecture and CTAP images without (Figure 4A) and with ensemble (Figure 4B) (three separate initial seeding).For the multimodal technique (M-CTAP), the CTAP images will use the same training dataset and UNet architecture without ensemble, while clinical information will be used to train model using ResNet architecture.  We will also explore two different methods of integrating the relevant clinical information using a weighted threshold ensemble.  The first method will train three separate ResNet model to evaluate the H&P, FMH, and LD separately before the output is ensembled with the CTAP images (3-CD, Figure 4C).The second will train a ResNet that evaluates all three sets of clinical information simultaneously prior to the output being ensembled with CTAP (c-CD, Figure 4D).The final decision Figure 4.

The experimental combinations are shown in Figure 4. Study Design: We will randomly select 70, 10, and 20% of the cases for training, validating, and testing the models, respectively. The cases will remain fixed for all the model training and testing steps. Training will be performed using k-fold dropout technique to minimize over fitting of the data. Training will be conducted until a plateauing  of  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  is  reached,  defined  as  <  0.1%  improvement  in  sensitivity  and specificity from the prior training episode on the validating cases. The final outcome will compare the sensitivity, specificity, false positives, and Dice coefficient of the various models (S-CTAP, M-CTAP, 3-CD, c-CD) at a per case level. Methods for Aim 2: We will test the hypothesis that our pilot AI-observer can improve the detection with transparent and detailed training. One of the key issues with AI model is the lack of transparency of training cases. In this objective, we aim to control the ratio of late stage cancer:  early stage cancer: confounding cases: normal cases while varying the total number of training cases (100 vs. 300 total training cases).We will compare the set ratios of 1:1:1:1, 1:2:2:1, 1:2:2:2, 1:2:1:2, 1:0.5:1:1, 1:1:0.5:1,  and  1:1:1:0.5,  as  well  as  randomly  selected  CRC  and normal/confounding  cases  (total  training  cases  of  100  vs.  300).The ratio  of  the  training  cases  will  assess  the  individual  and  synergistic effects  on  model  outcome  by  each  class  of  images.  The  randomly selected cases will come from the pool of CRC (both late and early stage) and non-CRC (normal-combined-with confounding) cases so as to  simulate  the  non-transparent  training  process.  The  randomly selected training pool will have CRC: non-CRC ratios of 3:7 and 7:3 at total cases of 100 and 300.UNet architecture will be used in building these  models  without  the  ensemble  technique.  The  experimental combinations are shown in Table 1. Study Design: We will compare the sensitivity, specificity, false positives, and Dice coefficient at a per case level from the outcome of different trained models using the previously noted combinations. Data Analysis Aims 1&2:  Statistical Analysis: Due to the nonlinearity of the CNN, the traditional power analysis cannot be applied to the current system. In general, training CNN for imaging analysis and segmentation requires thousands of cases. Here, we propose to gather 300 CRC cases each along with 150 confounding and 500 normal cases (950 total proposed  subjects)  all  with  their  associated  clinical  history  and  laboratory  data.  After  reaching  a  plateau  in sensitivity and specificity for detecting cancer lesions on the test cases, we will compare the final sensitivity, specificity,  and  Dice  coefficient  of  the  models  with  Wilcoxon  rank  test.  The  sensitivity,  specificity,  and  Dice coefficient statistic will be generated using a leave-out trial. Each leave-out trial will randomly select 90% of the test cases with 10 trials being run to generate a distribution for each model. The distribution between the models will then be tested using the Wilcoxon test. In addition, we will generate a receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) and test the area under curve (AUC).  1:1:1:1  1:2:2:1  1:2:2:2  1:2:1:2  Ratio of Training Cases: Late Cancer: Early Cancer: Confounders: Normal Cases  Table 1.

We intend to apply UNet for segmenting CTAP lesions and ResNet for processing clinical information (H&P, FMH, LD) as these architectures have been shown to outperform in these specific tasks [49].These networks will be integrated and optimized to segment the CT images by incorporating the probability of malignancy (prior probability) given patients history.  The outputs of these networks will be ensembled using either majority or weighted voting technique into a final outcome indicating whether and where an image contains a tumor. The data consist of the CT images prior to and at diagnosis and the corresponding clinical history consisting of symptoms  at  presentation,  family  medical  history,  physical  examination,  and  laboratory  work  such  as comprehensive blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel. Because tumor biomarkers (CEA and CA 19-9) are not typically obtained at initial diagnosis, we will collect these values if available but not initially incorporate them for training, unless the clinical metrics cannot reach 85% sensitivity and specificity. All images and clinical data will be collected retrospectively from 2012 to 2021 and on an ongoing basis through the duration of the project. The images will initially be collected from Banner Health Network and the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. To produce data for AI training, the CT findings relevant to CRC will be manually annotated using ITK-Snap 3.6.0 (open-source image segmentation software, www.itksnap.org). Annotation is performed on axial images by a trained technician/radiology-trainee at the instruction of JC with12 years of independent body imaging practice. These annotations will include the colon mass, colon mass with the associated colon segment, lymph nodes in associated draining station, peritoneal implants, and liver metastasis. For benign diseases, these will include colitis, diverticulitis, abscess/fistula, or cysts. A bounding box will also be placed over these same lesions with the same labels; each image slice will also be labeled with the number of tumor mass or name of benign lesions. This will allow future testing of image ensembles. Due to the nature of CNN, traditional statistical models do not apply for sample calculation, but are useful for assessing model accuracy. Traditional statistical measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and area-under-curve (AUC;  taken  from  receiver-operator  curves)  will  be  applied  to  assess  the  accuracy  of  the  CNN  model.  The reference standard will be the radiologist's (JC) annotation. In terms of sample size calculation, a traditional statistical technique has not been applied due to the nonlinear nature of CNN. However, literature has reported the empirical data size required to achieve various levels of image classification accuracy.  In terms of medical images,  the  accuracy  of  classifying  CT  studies  improves  with  increasing  number  of  training  samples  and frequently requires over 1000 cases to reach a clinically relevant accuracy of 80+% [50, 51].However, when more complex tasks are required such as classifying Flickr images, the accuracy improves in proportion to the size of the training data, up to a training set of 50 million images[52, 53].Based on these reports, we believe the minimum training dataset for simpler cases will be 500 to 1000 cases; more complex cases require a training database  beyond  1000  cases[52,  53].    With  our  initial  289  CRC  cases,  we  believe  that  with  on-going  data gathering throughout the funding period, we will collect nearly 500 CRC cases for final training of the AI-models.   We have already gathered 139 early and late stage CRC cases from Banner and 150 mostly late stage cases from MD Anderson in Houston. Of these, 141 cases have been annotated for training purposes. We also currently have 59 normal cases containing cysts but no other confounding lesions. These CRC cases will be divided into sets of 10 for the purposes of training. Each training set will contain 10 cases each for early stage, late stage, confounding, and normal cases (40 total). Should a set be insufficient in any category, substitutions with late stage disease (for insufficient early stage) or normal cases (for confounding disease) will be performed. Based on our current cases, we expect fewer early stage and confounding cases than late stage and normal cases. We aim to obtain about 300 cancer cases (200 late stage, 100 early stage), 150 confounding cases (enterocolitis and diverticulitis cases, n= 300), and 500 normal cases. This would yield 20 sets of late stage cancer, 10 sets of early stage cancer, 15 sets of confounding disease, and 50 sets of normal cases. For each training session, we will allocate 10%and 20% of these cases for validation and testing purposes, respectively. The cases will be randomly selected from each group to form the set. The training of AI model will iterate until we achieved 85% Discovery Boost Grant Application  January 2022  Principal Investigator: Chang, John C. 4.8 sensitivity  and  85%  specificity  of  the  presented  CT  slices  from  the  validation  set.  We  will  then  tabulate  the sensitivity, specificity, and false positives per case on a per case level using the testing dataset,  Potential Difficulties: There may be several potential obstacles for the proposed studies. The major difficulty in both aims relate to data preparation and python coding. As described previously, we have more than 150 CRC cases labeled and ready for testing. Further labeling and annotation of the cases will continue throughout the project with assistance from medical student and radiology technician under the guidance of Dr. Chang, PI. Post-doctoral fellow will work  with  Dr.  Liang  and  Dr.  Wang  to  develop  Python  code  for  the  AI-observers.  However,  with  both  co-investigators expertise in AI algorithm development, we do not see this as significant obstacle. The second potential issue involves insufficient training data to reach target sensitivity and specificity for the models. In this case, we will obtain additional cases of CRC from other Banner hospitals and imaging clinics in Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska through retrospective search of databases by diagnostic codes, as not all cases are referred to Banner MD Anderson clinic for cancer treatment. Banner hospitals and the recently acquired imaging clinics also serve private practice oncologists in the greater Phoenix area. Banner also acquired University of Arizona hospital in 2016-2017 fiscal year whose database has recently been merged with the Banner IT network, which can provide additional subject data for training. With the expanded search, we are confident that we can obtain an even larger number of cancer cases (> 1000) for training. The third potential issue relates to training data inhomogeneity, as the training cases are obtained from various clinical practices within Banner system (five unique radiology groups) and MD Anderson Houston. The inhomogeneity of the training cases may require increased training data to reach sufficient sensitivity and specificity, which we can address in the same manner as the second potential limitation. This issue is also considered a potential benefit as the inhomogeneity can train the model to have greater generalizability. Timeline of Events: Data Collection: We expect to continue case gathering  and  annotation  throughout  the entire  project.  We  currently  have  141  CRC cases annotated for training purposes and expect annotating  the  remaining  cancer  cases  (up  to 300)  while  collecting  confounding  and  normal cases would occupy up to at most 1 year. This is based  on  our  prior  research,  showing  ~14 minutes  to  manually  segment  a  CRC  case  (= 7000 minutes for 500 cases). This also includes searching for  CRC, confounding,  and  normal  cases  with  staging  of the CRC cases and gathering clinical data.  We also aim to exceed 300 CRC cases.   Aim 1: After data preparation, the actual implementation of the model will require 3 months while training and testing  the  model  will  require  additional  6  months  of  time.  We  will  initiate  the  model  building  and  training immediately so as to gain some preliminary knowledge of the process. Aim2: This aim will require the CTAP model from aim 1 and properly staged and labeled training data. Therefore, this objective would begin approximately 12 months into the project. Model training will be similarly extensive as in aim 1 and is expected to occupy 6 months. Refinement of Methodology: Given that the proposed training method and model construction are novel, we will use the remaining time for refining the models and the dataset. The time will be applied to building variants of the multimodal model and the implementation of that model. In addition, we will explore for potential methods to improve specificity without significantly",

The ECHO model leverages video conferencing technology to connect a team of specialists with primary care providers (PCP's) throughout the community in real-time, collaborative sessions (figure 1). Using proven adult learning techniques, these 'teleECHO' sessions employ case-based learning and mentorship to increase provider knowledge and confidence to treat complex patients. The results lead to the increased capacity of local workforces allowing patients greater access to care close to home, from providers they know and trust. For more information on the ECHO model, please see the attached supporting document titled 'About Project ECHO.'Arizona State University (ASU) has developed the Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) ECHO program to establish a state-wide, multi-disciplinary collaborative partnership to scale access to OUD treatment across the state of Arizona. This program is led by a multidisciplinary team of nine (9) subject matter experts (SME's) with backgrounds in clinical treatment of OUD, harm reduction, addiction psychiatry, pharmacy, psychology, OUD policy, and social issues related to OUD patients (ex. criminal justice system, LGBTQ populations, etc.). The MOUD ECHO meets biweekly for a total of twenty-four sessions in a calendar year. Each session has a dedicated topic (see attached program agenda/overview) in which an SME will provide a 20-30 minute didactic presentation to the group of learners. Then for the remainder of the 1-hour session, a participant from the learning community will present a case from a patient directly under their care. The group collectively consults on the patient case and provides feedback to the presenter on how to best move forward with treatment. As each case is discussed, the learning network collectively learns from each other and the experts on the call. Over time, providers in the MOUD program have reported increases in all aspects of knowledge and confidence in treating OUD patients that the program addresses (see attached program outcomes). Furthermore, participants also report that they have increases in overall job satisfaction, increased ability to meet their patient's needs, and that participation in ECHO program acts as a protective factor against professional burnout.The focus of this year's program will be centered on the cross-section between opioid-use disorder and mental illness. As such, we have integrated an ongoing special series dedicated mental health issues among patients with OUD, including the following topics: 1) Severe Mental Illness; 2) Trauma Disorders; 3) Managing Guilt, Shame, and Despair in OUD Treatment; and 4) Suicide Prevention. A complete list of the program topics and dates is included in the attached program agenda/overview.   Since program inception, the MOUD ECHO always been supported by a combination of funding sources including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), and the ongoing support from Arizona State University. To date, we have confirmed funding from AHCCCS and ASU for the 2023 program.

Patients with OUD also report negative experiences with provider communication in the primary care setting.4 Thus, it is the aim of this MOUD ECHO program to increase the knowledge, confidence, and ongoing support available to primary care providers across Arizona and the US to increase the system-level capacity to treat patients with OUD. Due to the ongoing barriers patients face in accessing treatment a special focus will be given to delivering patient-centered care, harm reduction, and reducing stigma across healthcare services.Recruitment PlanWe take a multifaceted approach to recruiting participants into our ECHO program, specifically targeting providers who are either newly waivered or are interested in becoming waivered. This plan includes the following strategies:1.      Advertising across our ECHO community: to date, we have 2,787 contacts within our own ECHO network that we communicate with regularly, including the ongoing communication of program offerings and upcoming sessions.2.      Generalized Outreach across Professional Networks: we leverage our collective resources to outreach across professional networks associated with program team members, community organizations, payer networks of providers, etc.3.      Direct Outreach to Community Clinics/Providers: our team will outreach directly to clinics and providers across the state of Arizona, particularly those in rural and underserved areas to promote the program and its benefits to providers.4.      Target Outreach to Establish ECHO Clinics of Excellence: every year we select a small number of clinics (10-15), to work closely with our program and become an ECHO Center of Excellence in treating OUD. These centers must complete tasks above and beyond standard attendance of sessions to earn this distinction.Please see some of our marketing materials attached within the supplemental documents.Prior ExperienceCollectively, our team at ASU has collaborated with over 60 healthcare partners to develop and launch a total of eight (8) ECHO programs. We have hosted 357 individual ECHO sessions across these programs and have delivered over 12,000 free, continuing medical education hours to over 2,000 unique learners.28 Oct 2022 12:28:565APPLICATION DETAILS REPORTTracking NumberApplicant Organization Name Arizona State University TEMP004359Application TypeApplication Sub Type Accredited Education ProgramMedical Education ProgramFoundation30 Aug 2022Medications for Opioid Use Disorder ECHO: Increasing the Capacity of Medical Providers to Treat Patients with Opioid Use Disorder Through Ongoing Education and Case-ConsultationStatusNewRequest DateProgram Title We have offered the MOUD ECHO program continuously since February 2020, delivering a total of 65 CME-eligible sessions. Each year the program has had a specific topic of focus central to patients with OUD. In 2020, shortly after the program launched, the Covid-19 pandemic hit the United States and the initial curriculum was revised to meet the emerging and ongoing needs of providers. There were many changes in practice policies and best practice standards throughout the pandemic, but particularly related to OUD treatment which saw unprecedented transformations in these areas. During the 2020 program, we utilized the model to rapidly disseminate the ongoing policy changes to providers across the state. Our hub team of experts synthesized the emerging policy changes and best practices as they emerged and communicated both the changes and their implications to clinical practices on a biweekly basis. This ultimately gave healthcare practitioners a centralized network to access rapidly changing information in near real time. Moving into the second year of the program (2021) the focus pivoted towards anti-racism and equity in OUD treatment, while the 2022 program focused on social determinants of health impacting OUD patients. The proposed focus for the 2023 MOUD ECHO program is the cross-section between OUD and mental health. Educational Outcome PlanThere are specific key measures we assess during this year long program, monitoring that program outcomes are in alignment with program objectives and to ensure we are providing the content that is most relevant to our audience. We have implemented a formal monitoring and evaluation plan (attached in supporting documents) to ensure high-quality and consistent reporting of program outcomes. This plan includes the administration of two survey's:1.      Post-Session Survey: administered after every session to assess session specific learning outcomes such as overall satisfaction. It also includes evaluation markers to assess perceived increases in knowledge, confidence, likelihood to change practice behaviors, the content's relevance to clinical practice, as well as the general CME related survey questions. This survey is identifying and contains all necessary information for reporting outcomes to our accredited CME office.2.      Biannual Survey: Since this program is run continuously throughout the year, we administer an anonymous retro-pre-post survey every 6-months to capture participants self-perceived growth in knowledge, confidence, and changes to their clinical practice through their participation in the program. Through this survey, we also assess participants perceived changes in overall job or career related measures such as job satisfaction, burnout, and ability to meet patient needs.Results of these surveys are reported to various stakeholders including quarterly reports to our funders and our CME office, as well as annually to Arizona State University. Furthermore, we have also presented program outcomes at various state and national conferences and aim to publish results in a peer-reviewed journal in 2023. 28 Oct 2022 12:28:566APPLICATION DETAILS REPORTTracking NumberApplicant Organization Name Arizona State University TEMP004359Application TypeApplication Sub Type Accredited Education ProgramMedical Education ProgramRequest DateProgram TitleFoundation30 Aug 2022Medications for Opioid Use Disorder ECHO: Increasing the Capacity of Medical Providers to Treat Patients with Opioid Use Disorder Through Ongoing Education and Case-ConsultationStatusNewNeeds Assessment with ReferencesNeeds Assessment.docx17 Oct 2022Letter of RequestLetter of Request_MOUD ECHO.pdf18 Oct 2022Program Agenda / OverviewSupplemental_CURRICULUM.pdf18 Oct 202228 Oct 2022 12:28:567APPLICATION DETAILS REPORTTracking NumberApplicant Organization Name Arizona State University TEMP004359Application TypeApplication Sub Type Accredited Education ProgramMedical Education ProgramFoundation30 Aug 2022Medications for Opioid Use Disorder ECHO: Increasing the Capacity of Medical Providers to Treat Patients with Opioid Use Disorder Through Ongoing Education and Case-ConsultationStatusNewRequest DateProgram TitleOrganizationsOrganization TypeApplicantType of InstitutionEducationPlease Specify Other Institution TypeUniversityAddress Line 1550 N. 3rd Street, 5th FloorAddress Line 2 CountryUnited StatesState/Province Tax ID/VAT Number86-6051042Websitehttps://www.asufoundation.org/First NameVirginiaLast NameDeSantoFax Number480-727-7782Organization/Institution NameArizona State University Foundationd/b/a PrefixMs.Middle NameESuffix Primary Phone Number480-965-1475Email Addressshaun.brenton@asu.eduAuthorized Signer NameShaun BrentonAuthorized Signer TitleAssociate Vice President of Corporate & Foundation RelationsAuthorized Signer EmailOCFRgrants@asu.eduIRS Tax Status LetterASUF_IRS TAX DETERMINATION LETTER.pdf18 Oct 2022CityPhoenixPostal Code85004Tax StatusNot For Profit 501(c)(3)W9 (Click on Blue Icon)2021ASUFW9.pdf18 Oct 202228 Oct 2022 12:28:568APPLICATION DETAILS REPORTTracking NumberApplicant Organization Name Arizona State University TEMP004359Application TypeApplication Sub Type Accredited Education ProgramMedical Education ProgramFoundation30 Aug 2022Medications for Opioid Use Disorder ECHO: Increasing the Capacity of Medical Providers to Treat Patients with Opioid Use Disorder Through Ongoing Education and Case-ConsultationStatusNewRequest DateProgram TitleOrganizationsOrganization TypePayeeType of InstitutionEducationPlease Specify Other Institution TypeUniversityAddress Line 1PO BOX 2260Address Line 2 CountryUnited StatesState/ProvinceAZTax ID/VAT Number86-6051042Websitehttps://www.asufoundation.org/Organization/Institution NameArizona State University FoundationPrefix CityTempePostal Code85280-2260Tax StatusNot For Profit 501(c)(3)First NameCherylLast NameCheryl O'TooleFax Number480-727-7368Middle Name Suffix Primary Phone Number480-965-6468Email Addressgiftprocessing-q@asu.edu   IRS Tax Status LetterASUF_IRS TAX DETERMINATION LETTER.pdf18 Oct 202228 Oct 2022 12:28:569APPLICATION DETAILS REPORTTracking NumberApplicant Organization Name Arizona State University TEMP004359Application TypeApplication Sub Type Accredited Education ProgramMedical Education ProgramFoundation30 Aug 2022Medications for Opioid Use Disorder ECHO: Increasing the Capacity of Medical Providers to Treat Patients with Opioid Use Disorder Through Ongoing Education and Case-ConsultationStatusNewRequest DateProgram TitleOrganizationsOrganization TypeAccrediting ProviderType of InstitutionUniversityPlease Specify Other Institution Type Address Line 1502 E.

FP00035641,869,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  amplified  the  social  and  health  inequities  experienced  by  racial/ethnic minority populations including Latinxs. It is also widely believed that both mis/disinformation and structural inequalities in the social environment contributed to disparities in COVID-19. However, it remains unclear how  exactly  these  factors  interacted  in  contributing  to  such  disparities.  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to develop a computational understanding of the impact of social media misinformation on vaccine uptake in Latinx communities.  The  central  hypothesis  is  that  the  interactions  between  (exposure  to)  misinformation  and  structural inequalities in the social environment influence health decision-making, and it is possible to quantitatively model such interactions. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Designing and implementing  new  studies  that  define  experiment  and  data  acquisition  protocols  for  best  supporting  the development  of  analytic  models;  2)  Determine  how  to  model  social  media  misinformation  and  online behavior  in  the  face  of  misinformation;  and  3)  Determine  how  precisely  (in  quantitative  terms) misinformation and other adverse conditions interact to impact vaccine uptake.   The proposed research is significant, because it will lead to discovery of a comprehensive, computational understanding of the interactions between social media misinformation and other sociopolitical determinants of health disparities in Latinx communities. Such a computational/quantitative understanding is missing in the current knowledge. Research results from this project will have an important positive impact immediately because  they  will  lead  to  the  development  of  precise  interventions  for  effectively  addressing  the  health disparities.

FP00035670,870,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary Recent technological advances, especially those for supporting continuous acquisition of personal health data, seem to suggest that precision health would soon become a reality, even in a home environment. Yet, careful examination reveals that there are still many significant barriers in practice. Physical therapy has been routinely used in prevention and treatment of chronic low back pain, a significant heath issue. However, presently there is no technology to reliably monitor compliance, ensure correctness, and track progress for unsupervised physical therapy at home. We identify two key technical challenges that impede the development of good solutions in this main: the system challenge and the inference challenge. To address these challenges, we take a design-driven approach in building a novel wearable system (addressing the first challenge), complete with innovative machine learning techniques (addressing the second challenge), for achieving precise at-home physical therapy in the domain of chronic low back pain. Our specific goal is to design, develop and pilot-test a novel wearable system, with integrated hardware (system) and software (algorithms), for supporting and improving unsupervised physical therapy at home, taking into consideration usability factors such as feedback mechanisms. The project exemplifies general design and engineering principles in developing realistic at-home solutions overcoming practical barriers in more general precision health contexts. The proposed work will bridge a significant knowledge gap in precise at-home physical therapy for treatment and prevention of chronic low back pain, which is a significant health risk to society. Our research efforts will advance knowledge and practice in the domains of wearable systems for healthcare, embedded machine learning/artificial intelligence, unsupervised physical therapy, and user behavior with personal health devices. Introducing visual biomechanical biofeedback based on wearable stretch sensors is a potential significant improvement over the main limitation of motion biofeedback and virtual reality exercise systems, namely the lack of a visual, personalized biomechanical model. Considering the nature of the problem, we employ a design-driven approach by explicitly addressing all aspects of the effort through innovative designs. The innovations in the proposed project collectively contribute to building a realistic system for addressing a real-world problem. The investigators have on-going research efforts preparing the team for addressing the challenges of the proposed work, including studies that form the foundation and preliminary work for key components of the proposed approaches. The unique composition of the team ensures that we have the right mixture of expertise for pursuing the proposed efforts.17",
FP00035675,871,,,,,1,,,"Achieving adequate physical activity (PA) is a major factor in preventing chronic diseases like cancer, yet only a fraction of adults and youth in the United States (US) achieve the recommended amounts of PA. Statistical trends show that underserved US residents, such as those who are low-income, high racial/ethnic minorities, or have physical disabilities, are least likely to meet PA recommendations when compared to their higher-income, white, and non-disabled counterparts - especially among women. These populations are also disproportionately at risk for developing certain types of cancers and other cardiometabolic diseases. Major barriers to PA among those living in underserved communities include lack of motivation, finances, access to opportunities, social support, and environmental safety.A promising opportunity exists through leveraging public school campuses for recreation (i.e., shared use). Access to school facilities, particularly outdoor facilities, is of heightened importance in underserved communities where access to safe places to recreate is often limited. Although access to school facilities after-hours is positively associated with PA, many open school playgrounds remain poorly or completely unused. Investing in the appeal of these spaces may increase usage, promoting positive health benefits. Existing studies measuring PA effects of renovated school playgrounds typically use older schools as comparisons. Alternatively, studies that analyze pre-/post- behavioral outcomes after playground renovations report conflicting outcomes (e.g., no increase v. significant increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA), and rarely consider other environmental and psychosocial influences. Further, examining the impact of school playground renovations on psychosocial constructs like neighborhood cohesion could provide deeper insight into the role that having safe, accessible, and appealing spaces to recreate has in promoting overall well-being.The proposed prospective, natural experiment will assess changes in usage, PA, and neighborhood cohesion among individuals attending two lower-income, high racial/ethnic serving school playgrounds after-hours following playground renovations. The study is guided by the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction embedded in a socioecological model of shared use and PA. We hypothesize that the intervention will impact individuals appeal and attitudes towards the environment, contributing to increases in usage, moderate-to-vigorous PA, and neighborhood cohesion. The research proposed under the F99 phase will allow for skill development in specific observational PA assessment and working collaboratively with district and school personnel. Following completion of this work during the doctoral program (F99 phase), I plan to expand on this research in a postdoctoral position (K00 phase) using mixed-methods to identify environmental and perceived barriers and facilitators to shared use and develop rigorous and prospective, yet sustainable and scalable interventions to overcome these barriers.",
FP00035787,872,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary A large majority of the older population typically does not meet the recommended public health guidelines for daily physical activity and instead sits for extended intervals throughout the day. As this sedentary time increases, serious metabolic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hyperinsulinemia, and all-cause mortality become more prevalent. Recent literature has shown the detrimental physiological outcomes of prolonged sedentary behavior may diminish with interrupted sitting periods. However, the potential effects have yet to be investigated in overweight and obese postmenopausal women, who are susceptible to cardiovascular and metabolic events. With reduced physical capacity, a relatively low burden intervention aimed to improve glucoregulatory and vascular function is an ideal therapy for this population. Using a robust discovery approach like metabolomics has enabled the analysis of small molecular alterations across various conditions. The ability to metabolically quantify the treatment effects may shed light on the underlying mechanisms that aid in healthy aging. For this fellowship, the candidate will leverage a Sponsors previously completed P01 clinical trial with the NIA, Rise for Health, to evaluate the metabolic effects of interrupted sitting time in postmenopausal women. The three five-hour study conditions (controlled sit, hourly standing breaks (HSB), and frequent sit-to-stand transitions (FSS)) will be analyzed with a metabolomics approach to identify the underlying metabolome signatures of each condition. Targeted panels of metabolites will then be assessed with adaptations in postprandial glucose and insulin AUC responses and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) outcomes. The candidate aims to build upon his preliminary findings from its pilot study, which demonstrated significant metabolic changes in the FSS and HSB conditions compared to the control. The candidate will train under Co-Sponsor Dr. Haiwei Gu at Florida International University in targeted metabolomics method design and advanced analysis.  In addition, a workshop hosted by the UC Davis West Coast Metabolomics center focused on untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics will be completed. A comprehensive training plan has been proposed to develop the expertise necessary to explore the entire metabolome and complete a dissertation centered on metabolic disease. The primary objective is to perform a complete metabolomics analysis of each sitting condition and identify underlying adaptations (Aim #1). Second, the candidate will assess how the metabolomic changes are associated with glucoregulatory biomarkers and AUC measurements of glucose and insulin (Aim #2). In addition, the candidate will examine the association between the metabolic signatures of FSS and HSB with FMD outcomes (Aim #3). Further understanding the benefits of reduced sitting time in an at-risk population will help promote its impact on healthy aging, reduce healthcare costs, and provide solutions to age-associated metabolic alterations.

FP00035847,873,,,,,1,,,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has successfully increased the number of older (>50 yo) people living with HIV (OPLWH) globally;13 however, it is now estimated that almost half of OPLWH are affected by HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.46 The most severe neurocognitive disorder is HIV-associated dementia (HAD).7 While only 5% of adults living with HIV globally are diagnosed with HAD,8 the prevalence of HAD is particularly severe in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which is also home to largest number of people living with HIV (and OPLWH).912 For example, among adults living with HIV in Uganda, the prevalence of HAD was estimated to 31% in 200713 and over 64% in 2013.14 HAD negatively affects survival, quality of life, and everyday function in OPLWH,15 imposing a large economic and social burden on Uganda.13,14,16 Similar countrywide rates of HAD exist across SSA,17,18 making HAD a critical issue for OPLWH in SSA, particularly in Uganda. Neurological researchers have investigated a wide range of physiological mechanisms for HAD,19 but to date, the neurological causes of HAD are still unknown. Researchers have also identified several socioeconomic factors that are associated with HAD,15 such as age, gender, and HIV infection duration,20 but these factors are not modifiable and offer limited guidance on strategies OPLWH in Uganda can take to mitigate their HAD risk. One understudied (and importantly  modifiable) potential behavioral risk factor for HAD is ART adherence, since non-adherence is known to increase HIV viral loads and reduce CD4+ T-cell counts.2123 Elevated HIV viral loads have been repeatedly associated with brain infections and sensory neuropathy, which has been hypothesized to cause HAD.24,25 Research has also shown that a low CD4 count is associated with HAD,20 which is hypothesized to occur by allowing HIV or other infections to enter the brain, causing HAD.26 Since ART non-adherence can lead to either immediate or delayed increases in HIV viral loads and/or reductions in CD4 count,27 a better understanding of the causal relationships among ART adherence, HIV disease severity (i.e. viral load and CD4 count), and HAD is necessary for identifying possibly behavioral interventions that can reduce HAD risk among OPLWH. The relationship between ART adherence and HAD may also be bidirectional, as it is known that HAD is associated with subsequent ART non-adherence.2830 Therefore, identifying behavioral solutions for either reducing HAD risk or managing the negative effects of HAD requires detailed longitudinal data containing measures of ART adherence, HIV disease severity, and HAD among OPLWH, which are rare in Africa. We have unique access to such data in Uganda, allowing us to statistically investigate these potential causal pathways. Our team has an extraordinary opportunity to study these relationships due to our long-standing collaboration (7 NIH-funded grants over the last decade) with one of the largest HIV clinics in Uganda. Mildmay Uganda treats over 55,000 clients, and importantly, Mildmay Uganda implemented an electronic medical records (EMR) system in 2017 that collects detailed longitudinal data on clients ART adherence, HIV disease severity, and comorbidities, such as HAD; our team has extensive experience working with Mildmays EMR data.3138 In this novel, exploratory R21 study, we will estimate a proof-of-principle model to investigate the impact of ART adherence and HIV disease severity on HAD. First, we will estimate composite-based structural equation models (cbSEM) to examine the causal hypothesis that ART non-adherence leads to a greater risk of HAD. Second, pathological studies have shown that short-term periods with unsuppressed HIV viral load alter white matter integrity in the brain,39,40 caudate, and basal ganglia nuclei.41,42 Thus, we plan to collect neuroimaging data from a strategically selected set of Mildmay Uganda clients both with and without HAD using a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to uncover potential brain-based biomarkers of ART non-adherence that would improve in the detection, diagnosis, and management of HAD. Mildmay Uganda estimates there are roughly 300 OPLWH who have been diagnosed with HAD since they began treatment at Mildmay, which provides sufficient statistical power for investigating the following specific aims:Aim 1: Estimate a cbSEM of ART adherence, HIV disease severity, and HAD among OPLWH in Uganda. We will investigate the direct and indirect effect of ART non-adherence on HAD, which will help to describe the patterns of ART non-adherence that are particularly risky for developing HAD. Importantly, we will be able to control for individuals demographics and health status, such as HIV infection duration, in these cbSEM analyses. Aim 2: Identify brain-based biomarkers that are correlated with ART non-adherence and HIV disease severity among 40 OPLWH stratified by ART adherence, HAD status and biological sex. We will collect advanced MRI measures at a fully-equipped imaging center local to Mildmay Uganda from OPLWH who vary in ART adherence, HAD status, and biological sex. These findings will suggest brain-based biomarkers of ART non-adherence, HIV disease severity, and HAD, which will enrich our cbSEM results and reveal key neurological targets for preventative interventions, such as physical activity, that are known to alter white matter integrity.Impact: This R21 will provide the first evidence of a modifiable behavioral risk factor of HAD among the population OPLWH who currently face the greatest risk of HAD in the world. In our subsequent R01, we will enhance the rigor of these findings by collecting behavioral and neuroimaging data from multiple Ugandan HIV clinics, with the goal of developing behavioral interventions to prevent HAD among OPLWH in future studies.",

The integrated programoutlined herein addresses all four of the BLiP Focus Areas with beyond-leading-edge innova-tions. These include advances in (i) nonlinear and sparse signal processing (Sparse Filteringand Point-frame filtering), (ii) non-repetitive waveform design, sequencing, and receiver pro-cessing (Doppler-resilient waveform scheduling and exploitation of polarization diversity),(iii) Track-Before-Detect, extending our results in gravitational wave detection and methodsfor multiple maneuvering targets; and (iv) interference modeling and mitigation.Our team, although academically based, incorporates substantial experience in imple-mentation and validation of radar signal processing methodology in addition to advancementof the theoretical foundations of the field. In particular, it includes professional staff whospecialize in implementation of algorithmic innovations in real-data environments as well asleading experts in fundamental and applied research.2 Technical ApproachWe aim to develop a comprehensive radar signal processing framework for track-before-detect, via the end-to-end integration of innovations in all focus areas (FAs) of the BAA.2.1 FA1: Non-linear Signal ProcessingWe will develop iterative sparse filtering methods, following clutter suppression, for estimat-ing and tracking location parameters (e.g., range, Doppler, and angles) of potential targets.These methods are inherently nonlinear because of the thresholding, scaling, and shrinkageoperators involved in their construction. We propose two related themes under this heading.Sparse filtering: Several variants of least mean square (LMS) with sparse regularization(e.g. 0, 1, and p) have been proposed (e.g., [1; 2; 3]). But LMS type algorithms in gen-eral exhibit slow convergence and are prone to poor tracking performance in time-varyingenvironments. A sparse version of RLS with 1-norm regularization, called SPARLS, wasproposed in [4]. This algorithm convergences to a global optimum at a computational com-plexity that is comparable to that of the EM algorithm. An online nonlinear version ofSPARLS was developed in [5]. However, these estimators are biased and, with 1 regulariza-tion, tend to over-shrink variables that they retain. Moreover, articles by Co-PI Pezeshki andcollaborators [6; 7] first highlighted that 1-regularized sparse recovery is extremely sensitiveto basis/dictionary mismatch caused by discretization of parameters such as range, Doppler,and angle. Signal modes almost never fall on the discretized dictionary modes and this gridmismatch causes leakage of a mode into nearby modes, invalidating sparsity and degradingaccuracy. Grid mismatch is particularly severe in radar, where leakage patterns often followthe Dirichlet kernel. This cannot be resolved by refining the discretization resolution [7].The minimax concave penalty (MCP), by Zhang [8], is an alternative semiconvex penaltythat performs variable selection while maintaining unbiasedness to a good extent. Wang etal. [9] employ MCP for sparse recovery with improved performance, but their framework doesHR001122S0008 Abstract1Source Selection Information  See FAR 2.101 and 3.104not apply to time-varying signals. Recently, Co-PI Pezeshki and collaborators [10] introducedan MCP-regularized RLS algorithm for online adaptive sparse system identification. Theproposed algorithm, called SPARLS-MCP, uses EM to produce recursive estimates of a sparsevector from streaming measurements and has a.s. convergence to a local minima. Numericalstudies on Rayleigh fading channels, Volterra systems, and multivariate time series modelsshow that SPARLS-MCP outperforms, in MSE, RLS and 1-regularized RLS. SPARLS-MCPalso appears to be much more robust to grid mismatch than the 1-regularized RLS.We propose to extend and apply SPARLS-MCP to iterative estimation of location pa-rameters of potential radar targets from streaming radar measurements and evaluate itsperformance on the data set provided by DARPA. We will also study the sensitivity of theSPARLS-MCP to grid mismatch and investigate approaches to further robustify it.Point-frame filtering (PFF): Point-frame filtering originates in the source localizationwork of Yardibi et. al [11], where the covariance matrix of a signal is approximated by afinite weighed sum of projections onto steering vectors. Subsequently, a robust version wasobtained by Kodituwakku et. al [12], who showed that a robust version of this techniquecould be used to improve detection probability of targets in heavy zero Doppler clutterrelative to conventional data tapering for short CPIs.forTwo questions arise: (1) Why do they work well, even on a single shot? (2) How to choosetheir parameters? These are answered in some, as yet unpublished, work by members of ourgroup, by interpreting the ideas in frame theory, specifically, adaptive dual frames (ADF).This setting opens up new pos-sibilitiesradar processing.The underlying ADF technique isgeneral and applies to both sin-gle parameters, such as Doppler,range, or angle, and to the entirerange-Doppler-angle space simul-taneously. Sparsity can also beincorporated in ADF. The result is a processing technique that is well-fitted to detection andlocalization of point targets. Figure 1 shows the effects of applying this filter for Doppler.Figure 1: Left to right: Standard Doppler processing,Blackman-Harris Doppler window, and ADF processing.2.2 FA2: Non-repetitive Waveforms and ProcessingNumerical studies show that sparse estimation methods are typically able to resolve sourcesthat are  1 Rayleigh limit (RL) apart in parameter space (e.g., range or Doppler) (whereastheoretically about 4 RL is predicted), but the resolution ability degrades considerablywhen sources are closer than that or one source is much weaker than a nearby source.This problem is exacerbated by leakage due to grid mismatch. Addressing this issue requiresdevelopment of methods for waveform scheduling, from within the available library, to createpulse train ambiguity functions with very low sidelobes in desired range-Doppler regions.Doppler-resilient waveform scheduling: In the absence of Doppler, low sidelobe levelsare achieved by a sequence of phased coded waveforms with impulse-like auto-correlationfunctions. But the auto-correlation functions of almost all such waveforms are extremelysensitive to Doppler. Off the zero-Doppler axis the impulse-like response in range failsdramatically. Co-PIs Pezeshki, Howard, and Moran have developed waveform schedulingHR001122S0008 Abstract2Source Selection Information  See FAR 2.101 and 3.104(a) Conventional(b) PTM(c) Binomial(d) Trade-offFigure 2: Delay-Doppler maps for (P,Q) designs: (a) conventional design, (b) PTM design,(c) Binomial design, and (d) max-SNR with 8-th order null. The scene contains three strongstationary reflectors at different ranges and two weak slow moving targets (30dB weaker).methods for suppressing Doppler-induced sidelobes [13; 14]. In [14] , extending on the priorwork in [13], a general method for constructing radar transmit pulse trains and receive filtersfor which the radar point-spread function in delay and Doppler (cross-ambiguity function)is essentially free of range sidelobes inside a Doppler interval around the zero-Doppler axishas been introduced. The Tx pulse trains are constructed by coordinating the transmissionof a pair of Golay complementary waveforms across time according to 0s and 1s in a binarysequence P. The waveforms in the Rx filter pulse train follow the same order, but they areweighted according to the entries of a sequence Q. The spectrum of essentially the product ofP and Q controls the range sidelobes of the cross-ambiguity, allowing effective annihilation ofrange sidelobes at low Doppler (or within a given Doppler band) by choice of the (P, Q) pairs.Joint design of (P,Q) provides maximized output SNR for a given order of spectral null.Figure 2 illustrates the annihilation of range-sidelobes around zero-Doppler for three differentlength N = 16 (P,Q) designs and compares their delay-Doppler responses with that of analternating transmission of Golays followed by a matched filter at the receiver. All 4 Tx pulsetrains have the same total energy. The PTM design gives the smallest order null (M = 3),clearing (below 80dB) a narrow Doppler band around the zero-Doppler axis, but has anSNR gain of 16 in white noise. The binomial design gives the largest order null M = 14,clearing a much wider Doppler band, but at the expense of reduction in SNR gain (reducedto 6.92). The last design (tradeoff) has the largest SNR gain (of 13.76) among all (P, Q) pairsthat achieve an (M = 8)th order spectral null at zero Doppler. These designs can be extendedto libraries with more than two waveforms [14]. They can also be extended to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar, by designing Tx-Rx pairs of paraunitary waveform matriceswhose matrix-valued cross-ambiguity functions are essentially free of range sidelobes aroundthe zero-Doppler axis [14].We propose to leverage the above waveform coordination framework for suppressingDoppler-induced range sidelobes to facilitate the sparse estimation methods described inFocus Area 1. The waveform library need not be a library of Golay waveforms. Our methodapplies to any waveform library whose components have a low-sidelobe composite (coherentlysummed) auto-correlation function (e.g., an up-chirp and a down-chirp).Leveraging polarization diversity: The use of two orthogonal polarizations increases thedegrees of freedom available for target detection and can result in significant improvementin performance. The radar cross section of an aircraft or drone is highly sensitive to theangle of incidence and angle of view of the sensor. In general the reflection properties thatapply to each polarization component are also different, and indeed reflection can changeHR001122S0008 Abstract3Doppler [rad]Delay [sec]N=16, Conventional design, output in dB  32101230.811.21.41.61.822.22.4x 1059080706050403020100Doppler [rad]Delay [sec]N=16, PTM design, output in dB  32101230.811.21.41.61.822.22.4x 1059080706050403020100Doppler [rad]Delay [sec]N=16, Binomial design, output in dB  32101230.811.21.41.61.822.22.4x 1059080706050403020100Doppler [rad]Delay [sec]N=16, Optimal PQ design with M=8, output in dB  32101230.811.21.41.61.822.22.4x 1059080706050403020100Source Selection Information  See FAR 2.101 and 3.104the direction of polarization. Target detection is enhanced by concurrent rather than serialaccess to the cross-polarization components of the scattering tensor. Co-PIs Howard andMoran (with Calderbank) introduced unitary waveform matrices for coherent processing indual polarimetric radars [15; 16]. This unitary illumination across horizontally and verticallypolarized antennas provides access to the full polarization (co-polar and cross-polar) scat-tering matrix on a pulse-by-pulse basis. It enables discrimination of low radar cross-sectiontargets in clutter by making structure evident that is not apparent in any one-dimensionalprojection. We propose to investigate the value of polarization diversity on both transit andreceive for end-to-end track-before-detect performance. We anticipate that dual polarizationwill be particularly helpful in improving the sparse estimations described in Focus Area 1.2.3 FA3: Multiple-Hypothesis Track-Before-DetectCo-PI Evans, his students and collaborators have been at the forefront of track-before-detect(TBD) and related methods since the 1980s. Evans et al. have developed filters for TBDusing probabilistic data association (PDA) [17], multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) [18] and,most recently, set-tracking (Bernoulli) type methods [19; 20]. The second of these papersinitiated several other papers by its co-authors based on the same ideas. TBD methods aretypically characterized by recursively updated probabilities of track existence and/or birth-death processes for tracks based on observations via a tracking/smoothing process, such asextended/unscented Kalman filtering, particle filtering, variational Bayes, and MCMC.TBD methods in gravitational wave detection: Co-PIs Evans, Suvorova, and Moranhave been instrumental in the UniMelb team on the Australian Gravitational Wave Centre(OzGrav) in introducing innovative signal processing methods, including TBD Viterbi andForward-Backward filtering, and iterative estimator-correlator techniques, for detecting sig-nals with randomly varying frequencies as arise from astrophysical systems (e.g. rotatingneutron stars, binary systems) [21].Inherently one-dimensional (frequency), these mod-els otherwise fit TBD methodology and are readily adapted to TBD. In simulation, close tooptimal detection of trajectories (incl. multiple ones) through frequencies has been obtained.Markov-chain-based TBD: We will leverage experience in gravitational wave detectionfor TBD of multiple maneuvering targets using radar measurements. Both integrated PDAand Bernoulli methods for TBD for multiple maneuvering targets will be addressed withimprovements from our OzGrav effort. Dynamic programming, as in our gravitational wavework, will be used. Also to be considered are our MCMC techniques [22].2.4 FA4: Main-beam Interference MitigationSeveral studies indicate that communication-to-radar interference (C2RI), particularly fromLTE systems, is better modeled by log-normal or heavy-tailed K distributions rather thanby Gaussian distributions [23; 24; 25; 26]. This is in agreement with work by NTIA [27],which also reports that even at relatively low interference-to-noise ratios (INRs), C2RI cancause a considerable degradation in radar performance. Several other studies have shownthe relevance of cyclostationary models for characterizing linearly-modulated interference(e.g., OFDM) C2RI [28; 29; 30] and suggest that considering such models in interferencemitigation may result in up to 20dB SINR gain.HR001122S0008 Abstract4Source Selection Information  See FAR 2.101 and 3.104Modeling interference: We will investigate K-distributions and cyclostationary models forC2RI mitigation and refine these models using ray tracing software such as RFView.1 We willuse RFView in two ways: (1) Fit statistical models to realizations of C2RI; these models willbe augmented with the real data provided by DARPA to facilitate interference mitigationand to establish performance limits.(2) Use perturbations in the scenarios to examinesensitivities of our interference mitigation to model mismatch and increase its robustness.Interference mitigation: We propose to develop and evaluate main-beam interferencemitigation schemes for a broad class of cyclostationary C2RI models. To this end, we willextend and evaluate (adaptive) frequency shift filters, also called cylic Wiener filters [33], forinterference mitigation on the DARPA data set. Such filters have shown promise in removingcyclostationary interference in preliminary studies on simulated data [24; 28]. We also aimto develop tractable analytical models based on best k-term approximations of the strongestinterferers to effectively characterize the detectable range and tracking accuracy of a radarin the presence of communication interference.3 Management Plan/Capabilities and TeamingASU will serve as the team lead, with primary responsibility for administrative interfacewith the Govermment and the sub-awardees.

FP00035925,875,,,,,1,,,"The HIV prevention and care continuum in Vietnam has significant gaps in care and poor outcomes for adolescents and young adults living with HIV (AYALWH). There is a significant gap between the percentage of people living with HIV (PLWH) who are diagnosed and those who are engaged in treatment and n ART. The AYALWH also have poor outcomes in awareness knowledge of HIV, early identification via screening and testing in primary care or other preventive health settings, and subpar referral to engagement, and retention in treatment. These problems are amplified in high-risk AYALWH such as men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), female sex workers (FSW) and transgender. In addition, the AYALWH suffer a high prevalence of depression, hazardous alcohol use, and for men tobacco smoking, all factors that are associated with poor identification, referral to and engagement in treatment, ART adherence, viral load suppression rates. The key personnel in this proposal will establish a Clinical Research Center between Arizona State University and colleagues in Vietnam (Hanoi Medical Center, Ho Chi Minh City University of Medicine and Pharmacy, the South Vietnam Addiction Technology Transfer Center, and a network of HIV clinics in order to conduct capacity building to utilize the RE-AIM model of translational and implementation science into the prevention and management of HIV. The main focus of this study is to improve secondary HIV prevention outcomes of treatment engagement, retention, ART adherence and viral suppression rates. The secondary outcomes are to identify and offer stepped care treatment for treat depression, tobacco smoking cessation, and hazardous alcohol use. We will achieve these goals via a comprehensive workforce training program for counselors in HIV clinics in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, including follow-up supervision to ensure implementation using RE-AIM measures. The study design is a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the workforce training on clinical outcomes for AYALWH for depression, alcohol, and tobacco smoking, and predict that improvement in these behavioral problems will result in improved treatment retention, ART adherence and viral load suppression.",
FP00035975,876,,,,,1,,,"Computational and instrumental enhancements to the fetal reserve indexs contextualized improvements over traditional monitoring for the detection of fetal and neonatal compromiseFear of poor outcomes and the liability exposure from such have cast a pall over obstetrics for decades often leading to practitioners abandoning delivery services prematurely in their careers. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) has been the   primary tool for predicting and preventing ND, but it has unfortunately failed, owing in part to 1. defining too narrowly many factors that need be incorporated in predicting onset of these and other problems in labor, 2. the inability of the majority of providers to properly interpret the subtleties of EFMs qualitative methodology used for 50 years, and 3. Our data show that a considerable proportion of the risk is likely occurring in the first 15-30 minutes AFTER birth when close observation and interventions are generally not occurring except for the highest risk babies. Recognizing a problem, DHHS has recently issued an Action Plan focusing on the need for dramatic improvements in fetal and maternal management and outcomes. The FMFA (and KLS LLC are collaborating on development of the Fetal Reserve Index (FRI) that improves fetal health outcomes during labor and delivery by identifying labors at risk for distress through advanced, comprehensive real-time screening. The FRI is a disruptive technology that will replace the subjective, poorly performing current methods of EFM interpretation with a computerized, quantified, contextualized system that should substantially improve outcomes on labor and delivery. Implementing the FRI system into practice is also expected to reduce emergency deliveries, cesarean delivery rates (CDRs), and compromised babies, including those with ND and cerebral palsy (CP). Implementation will also significantly lower medical costs for mothers and babies, and consequently reduce litigation and its costs, both psychological and financial, from ND babies. For 50 years standard EFM has high false positive rates producing skyrocketing emergency vaginal and cesarean deliveries (CD) (>30% in USA).1,2 However, EFM has not reduced the rate of fetal compromise and neurological damage including cerebral palsy (CP),1 which have remained stable for 30 years.3 There is an urgent need for better and more quantitative tools that do not require sophisticated bedside interpretations, which are frankly beyond the capabilities  of the majority of providers. Our disruptive assessment is that a considerable part of the problem is that EFM has been considered in a vacuum. It ignores significant contextual issues such as increased contractions and the presence of maternal, fetal, and obstetrical risk factors that should significantly be formally used to alter interpretation of EFM. Levels of prior and emerging risk are essential for the optimal interpretation and physiologic relevance of EFM outputs, even when machine learning applications are incorporated. As with principles of teratology, clinical, physiologic reasonableness is still needed.  Furthermore, our data show that physiologic deterioration starts earlier than understood and continues for several minutes postpartum before recovery begins. We need to better understand the dynamics, contributors, and possibilities for innovative management that can be gleaned from these observations. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group with internationally recognized expertise, at FMF/KLS, in high-risk obstetrics, genetic and congenital fetal evaluation and management throughout pregnancy, labor and delivery, public health, sociology, and technology assessment, and at ASU,  leading-edge engineering development computational approaches to complex data and the development of biological sensors.   Preventing neurologic impairment/developmental delay (ND) in children, with many alleged to        have come from improper labor management, is generally considered to be the most critical issue in obstetrics in the United States. We propose the following specific aims:AIM I: Improve the contextualization of EFM with more advanced assessment and weighting of the risk factors and levels of uterine contractility. We will use sophisticated machine learning methods to integrate these factors.AIM II:  Incorporate new approaches of data not normally considered to improve assessment of risks such that less aggressive adjustments to care can improve care and lower costs. We will link these advancements to further refinement of the FRI system to keep the fetus from getting into trouble rather than the current norm of rescuing it just before it would fall over the cliff.AIM III: Extend the concepts of these advancements (as above) to be predictors of neonatal responses and adaptation to the postnatal environment which can potentiate earlier, more successful, and cheaper interventions.",

Organize and plan a scientific workshop of Arizona stakeholders (including patients and caregivers) around screening of ATTR CA 2. Conduct a pre-workshop electronic survey in the form of a brainwriting exercise on barriers and opportunities in ATTR CA screening 3. Conduct a panel discussion with presentations of clinicians, patients, scientists, and policymakers 4. Create a system map of amyloid screening by conducting a tabletop exercise in which successive clinical scenarios are presented to participants Project Design and Methods: This is a scientific workshop that will immediately follow a CME event Updates in Cardiac Amyloidosis on January 14th, 2023.  Prior to the workshop, participants will be asked to write about barriers and opportunities in CA diagnosis and screening (brainwriting) across domains of practice, policy, and research.  At the time of the workshop, we will begin with brief participant-led presentations (5-7 min) on barriers and opportunities in ATTR CA practice, policy and research followed by a panel discussion.  There will be separate panels for clinicians, patients, scientists, and policymakers.  We will then conduct a tabletop exercise in which the study team will present realistic scenarios that health professionals could face related to ATTR CA screening.  We will conduct live-polling with the participants to determine how they would prefer to engage in the future in an amyloid-focused community of practice. Project Outcomes: This is one of the first studies to document determinants of optimal amyloid screening from the perspective of health care professionals and patients.  The results will be published in JACC Cardiooncology to inform wider dissemination in the scientific community.  The findings will be used to inform new quality improvement programs to expand ATTR CA screening in at-risk populations including those that may be underrepresented in current practice. Without this project, efforts to implement evidence-based screening for patients with ATTR CA may miss their mark due to poor design and planning.  Finally, this project will lead to the development of a new community of practitioners focused on ATTR CA screening and treatment in Arizona.",

Continuous labor support via trained doulas has been recognized as an evidence-based, cost-effective, and highly acceptable intervention to reduce severe maternal morbidity and mortality, and improve infant outcomes, particularly for communities facing disparities (Attanasio et al., 2021; Elevance Health Public Policy Institute, 2022; Falconi et al., 2022; Kozhimannil et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2017). Despite this, access to doulas has been limited by several implementation barriers, including limited Medicaid reimbursement (Falconi et al., 2022) and other disparities in prenatal healthcare access (Howell, 2018; Noursi et al., 2021). Guided by the Health Equity Implementation Framework (HEIF; Woodward et al., 2021), the proposed funding would support a community-engaged, equity focused approach to the development of implementation strategies to expand the reach of culturally appropriate doula services. The HEIF focuses on the personal, clinical, and societal context in which health and healthcare are experienced. Consequently, we will take a multimethod approach to conducting a needs assessment, including quantitative analysis of state-level data from the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), culturally grounded Talking Circles held with members of birthing communities, and Listening Sessions held with a statewide Learning Community of providers. In addition, we will conduct GIS mapping of resources related to prenatal and postnatal care to inform a community prioritization activity, for which we will follow an established strategy selection method (Carroll et al., in preparation; Knapp et al., 2022) and develop an Implementation Research Logic Model (Smith et al., 2020) to systematically connect determinants and strategies to test in Phase 2.",
FP00036033,880,,,,,1,,,"5.5.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We propose to develop and implement a comprehensive medical education and care management program for primary care providers in Maricopa County on subjects related to recovery on Post-Covid-19 conditions. This program will have an emphasis on primary care providers serving low-income households seeking medical care for their families and themselves. Such groups are more likely to have preexisting conditions and comorbidities that complicate their Covid treatment. We are a designated Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) replicating partner based in Arizona, serving Arizona physicians and beyond, as well as other providers such as advanced practitioners, nurses, and clinical psychologists. Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) is an innovative continuing medical education model designed specifically to increase the capacity of local providers in rural and underserved areas. This is accomplished by connecting an interdisciplinary team of subject matter experts (the hub) with an active learning network of geographically dispersed medical providers (the spokes) across Arizona. This hub-and-spoke model will meet weekly via teleconferencing technology (i.e. Zoom) to disseminate knowledge in an all-teach-all-learn format. The subject matter experts deliver short didactic presentations of post-Covid specific health issues and the learning community presents real cases from patients they serve inside their local clinics for consultation and recommendations for best-practice care. Our team will implement the Post-Covid ECHO Program for primary care providers in Maricopa County across three cohorts of learners, leveraging the Project ECHO model to establish a learning collaborative to scale evidence-based education and best-practices in treating patients suffering from the long-term effects of Covid-19.  5.5.2 PROPOSAL Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) is an innovative continuing medical education model designed specifically to increase the capacity of local providers in rural and underserved areas.

Systematic evaluations based on objective measures are needed to demonstrate long-term impacts of the WIC program cash value benefit (CVB) increases instituted in March 2021 among this population that experiences increased barriers to participating in WIC.Purpose and Aims: We will examine the impacts of increased CVBs on Inter Tribal Council of Arizona (ITCA) WIC program outcomes including (1) participant benefit redemption, program engagement, and retention, and examine whether associations differ by access to WIC-authorized retailers, (2) the prevalence of obesity among children, and (3) employees delivery of nutrition education messages.Study Design: For this mixed-methods study, we will utilize monthly enrollment and redemption data spanning from March 2018 to March 2024, and child height and weight data for select periods, provided by our collaborators at ITCA WIC. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with ITCA WIC employees. Repeated cross-sectional measurements over a 6-year period allow us to examine associations between increased CVBs and outcomes across different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants/Setting: The study sample will include all participants served monthly by ITCA WIC between March 2018 and March 2024. Of the approximately 7000 participants served monthly, majority (87%) of ITCA WIC participants identify as of American Indian race and 31% identify as of Hispanic ethnicity.Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes include participant fruit and vegetable benefit redemption, program engagement (appointment attendance), program retention (re-certification), obesity prevalence among participating 2-4-year-old children, and WIC employee perceptions of nutrition education delivery.Data Analysis: We will examine whether the increased CVBs are associated with our outcome variables using multivariable regression models. Interaction analysis will be used to examine the moderation effect of access to WIC-authorized retailers. To examine the association between increased CVBs and obesity status for participating 2-4-year-old children, we will utilize a difference-in-difference approach based on a multivariable logistic regression model.

FP00036091,882,,,,,1,,,"The proposed project will characterize determinants of health behaviors among Hispanics, to delineate how social networks, including family networks, influence dental health outcomes. Hispanics are affected by oral health disparities (OHD), including having disproportionate prevalence of dental caries (tooth decay) and experiencing worse oral health outcomes than most other racial/ethnic groups. Important health behaviors that influence the risk for OHD include dietary behaviors, oral self-care behaviors (e.g., brushing with toothpaste, flossing), and utilization of preventive dental care. To eliminate OHD, we must understand the precise sequence of mechanisms through which fundamental causes rooted in social and family environments affect health. Hispanic oral health behaviors, as proximate risk factors for unfavorable dental outcomes, are determined by upstream social factors. The latter include socioeconomic status (SES), education, ethnicity, and immigration experiences. The mechanisms through which these fundamental causes of health are associated with dental outcomes (e.g., caries) have not been fully characterized. We will study these mechanisms by focusing on social networks: the social environment within which information spreads, and where norms about health behaviors are modeled and enacted. A key component of the social environment is the family network, made up of relationships to and between immediate, extended, and fictive kin. Social networks, including family networks, have been shown to influence multiple aspects of health and disease. The present study is a real-world, pragmatic observational study that will explore multi-level (i.e., individual, interpersonal, family) and multi-domain (behavioral, sociocultural environment) factors driving oral health among Hispanics. Our aims are:Aim 1. Identify associations between upstream social factors and downstream oral health behaviors and dental outcomes among Hispanics.Aim 2. Quantify how social networks are associated with oral health behaviors and oral health outcomes among Hispanics. Aim 3. Determine whether social network processes mediate or moderate the associations between social factors, oral health behaviors, and oral health outcomes among Hispanics and their families. Our long-term goal is attaining an actionable knowledge base to inform clinical approaches and policy decisions. This proposed research will support preventive interventions and health promotion programs for Hispanics, their families, and their communities in real-world environments.",
FP00036200,883,,,,,1,,,"This program expands the Arizona State University (ASU) Speech & Hearing Clinics free speech and swallowing exercise program to include more people with Parkinsons Disease (PD), increase caregiver resources, and, in collaboration with other stakeholders, become a regional center of support for the PD community. The clinic currently offers SPEAK OUT! (individual exercise) and LOUD Crowd (group exercise) services. These services are an evidence-based speech therapy exercise program created by the Parkinson Voice Project (PVP). They emphasize speaking louder and with intent; techniques shown by research to improve speech, voice, swallowing, and airway protection leading to better overall health (Leavitt, 2014). We wish to expand but require stakeholder support and grant funding.After an initial speech evaluation, participants engage in 6 weeks of individual therapy. Therapy sessions are scheduled 2 times per week and participants are offered a choice of in-person or telehealth services. Each session follows a planned protocol, but clinicians individualize the content. Participants are provided with a workbook by the PVP and are tasked to complete exercises in between sessions. The PVP supports participants by offering free live exercise sessions and recordings online. Caregivers are invited to attend therapy sessions as well as intermittent caregiver events sponsored by the clinic. The inclusion of caregivers is beneficial for the success of the participants (Bhimani, 2004). Approximately 10% of each session is dedicated to education. Topics include, but are not limited to, changes to the speech/swallow systems, compensatory strategies, and local resources. Education is designed to provide tools for client and caregiver self-advocacy.Once the participant has met their goals and completed the SPEAK OUT! program, they transition to a LOUD Crowd group. This group aims to promote maintenance, provide accountability, and offer support/encouragement from peers. Participants are encouraged to attend the LOUD Crowd for as long as they wish. This continued contact also allows clinicians to monitor progress and offer SPEAK OUT! refresher sessions as needed, understanding the degenerative nature of the disease.Services are provided by graduate student clinicians enrolled in the Master of Science Communication Disorders program under the supervision of a licensed and certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). There are currently five SLPs trained in the PVP program. In addition to providing necessary services to individuals with PD, the program also presents a rich learning opportunity for SLPs in training. These SLPs can use the training in their future practice either in Arizona or another part of the country.",
FP00036232,884,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary/Abstract  Late-life depressed adults are 5x more likely to exhibit elevated autistic traits than non-depressed, and those with subclinical, elevated autistic traits (~25% of the population; aka the Broad Autism Phenotype [BAP]) experience higher rates of depression than those with lower traits. We and others have shown that both in person and mHealth adaptions of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) improve depression in autistic and older adults. Mobile MBI apps are highly accessible; however, adherence is poor due to declining motivation and forgetfulness. Anchoring, or pairing a new behavior to an existing routine, can successfully establish habits by targeting the psychological mechanism of behavioral automaticity, which describes the degree to which a behavior is performed unconsciously. Automaticity reduces the cognitive demand of a behavior, which is well suited for the cognitive difficulties associated with aging, depression, and BAP. In our previous research, we found that anchoring app-based meditation improved long-term adherence and depression reduction in autistic and non-autistic adults. Moreover, the effect size for app meditation adherence was substantially larger among autistic adults than a similar study we conducted with non-autistic adults. We hypothesize this is because of the increased reliance on routine associated with autism, which is also a feature of BAP. The overarching aim of this application is to build on these promising findings by testing the long-term effects of anchoring app-based meditation for late-life depressed adults, stratified by autistic traits, in a fully-powered study using a research grade meditation app (Healthy Minds) over a longer duration than prior behavioral maintenance studies. We will nationally recruit depressed adults >60 years, stratified by high/low autistic traits (n=450) via internet strategies for a Stage 1/2 Efficacy/Intervention Refinement study. We will randomly assign participants to: 1) App, 2) App+Anchoring, or 3) No App Control. App groups will be instructed to meditate 10-min/day for 3 months. Only the App+Anchoring participants will be instructed to use an existing morning routine to anchor daily mediation. In Aim 1, we will evaluate intervention efficacy for primary (adherence and depression) and secondary (cognition) outcomes immediately after the 3-month intervention, and 3- and 9-months post-intervention. In Aim 2, we will examine autistic traits as a moderator and behavioral automaticity as a mediator of intervention efficacy. In Exploratory Aim 3, we will identify barriers and facilitators via individual in-depth qualitative interviews conducted in a sub-sample stratified by anchoring success for intervention refinement. Our expected outcome is to provide an effective and scalable mHealth intervention for late-life depression. This is relevant to public health because our study will contribute accessible precision mental health options for older adults with and without BAP. Further, our mechanistic focus will positively impact the science of behavior change by identifying a mechanistic target for other health behavior adherence interventions among older adults in clinical and non-clinical groups (e.g. physical activity and medication adherence).

FP00036323,887,,,,,1,,,"Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a leading risk factor for Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) that are diagnosed in over 6 million Americans. Reducing blood pressure via anti-hypertensive (AH) medication mitigates ADRD risk; however, non-adherence is pervasive. Autistic adults have a greater prevalence of hypertension and are less adherent to AH medications than non-autistic adults. Correspondingly, autistic adults have a 2.6x higher risk for ADRD than non-autistic adults. There are >5.4 million autistic adults in the U.S., making it one of the most common lifelong developmental disorders. Establishing habitual pill taking may be a key strategy for maintaining long-term AH medication adherence, particularly among autistic adults. Psychological barriers reported by >50% of non-adherent patients include forgetfulness and motivation. Creating habitual behaviors is a solution to these barriers because habits are reliably performed with little or no cognitive effort. Pairing daily pill taking with an existing routine, often called Anchoring, has been shown to improve long-term medication adherence. Anchoring targets the psychological mechanism of behavioral automaticity, which describes the degree to which a behavior is performed non-consciously. Importantly for autistic adults, targeting behavioral automaticity builds on a strength of reliance on routines. Our preliminary anchoring research with autistic adults found increased behavioral automaticity for using a health app, and better maintained app use and clinical symptom reduction at six-month follow-up compared to autistic adults who did not receive anchoring training (the effect size was substantially larger than a similar anchoring intervention we conducted among neurotypical adults). Taken together, anchoring may be particularly well suited for autistic adults to maintain AH medication adherence. Our long-term goal is to develop interventions that improve adherence to health behaviors in autistic adults and reduce their elevated ADRD risk. In this proposal we will develop and empirically test two anchoring strategies (compared to a non-anchoring control group) to enhance behavioral automaticity for long-term AH medication adherence; which in turn, will reduce ADRD risk among autistic adults. Our R61 Aim is to establish feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a Stage 1, 6-month (4-month intervention and 2-month no contact follow-up) randomized pilot study design (n=30; 10 per group). In the R33 phase Stage 2, 10-month proof-of-concept study design (n=120; 40 to each study group), our specific aims are to: 1) Assess study group differences in AH medication adherence and cardiovascular health, 2) Examine psychological mediators and moderators of AH adherence, and 3) Explore study group differences in cognition. Our expected outcome is to identify a behavioral mechanism that can be reliably manipulated to promote long-term treatment adherence in autistic adults. This is relevant to public health because autistic adults are an NIA health disparities priority population that is disproportionately vulnerable to ADRD and our remote and low-cost approach will provide a readily scalable intervention.",
FP00036367,888,,,,,1,,," PROJECT SUMMARY: Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of pathology and implicated in nearly every neurodegenerative  disease, but neuroimmune function remains difficult to define mechanistically in model systems and nearly  impossible  to  interpret  from  clinical  imaging  data.  Clinically  detectable  epiphenomena  of neuroinflammation, like edema and metabolic changes, are rarely correlated to a single mechanism, but  they  are  ultimately  the  product  of  transcriptional  programs.  Here  we  propose  a  means  to computationally derive the molecular signatures of neuroimmune states from non-invasive imaging with MRI  spectroscopy  and  from  spatial  transcriptomic  data.  Further,  we  will  use  these  correlative representations of the same biological phenomena as a bridge between the two modalities. We  have  developed  several  algorithms  based  on  sparse  filtering  (SFt),  a  high-performing unsupervised learning method that derives sparse features with a complementary signature matrix of weighted components. The neural network architecture of SFt allows us to add further convolutional layers  to  address  data  types  that  convolve  molecular  and  spatial  information.  Magnetic  resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI), is one such data type that contains an array of spectral data within a spatial grid. Multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) similarly captures spatial information with channels of expression data. We will collect correlative MRSI and MERFISH, first  analyzing  each  dataset  separately  with  convolutional  SFt,  and  further  integrate  both  datatypes using  an  encoder/decoder  deep  learning  model  to  interpret  neurometabolic  data  in  terms  of transcription. Finally, we will use this novel analysis method to quantify the differences between mouse models of inflammation and human pathologies, using currently available clinical data.  Successful  aims  will  experimentally  validate  transcriptional  features  as  representations  of neuroimmune  states,  spectral  features  as  non-invasive  biomarkers  of  neuroinflammation,  and  a machine learning-based tool to interpret mechanistic information from a clinical imaging modality.

FP00036368,889,,,,,1,,,"Structural factors of focus: Healthy communities are composed of members who have opportunities to thrive through access to the resources needed to establish optimal health outcomes. A crucial need - quality and affordable nutritious food - can be negatively impacted by structural inequities impeding the availability and accessibility of resources resulting in food insecurity. Food insecurity often interplays across structural factors spanning policies, socioeconomic factors, racial/ethnic inequities, and cultural norms to impact marginalized populations. As an unmet social need related to the larger array of social determinants of health, food insecurity is further influenced by neighborhood infrastructure that enables food deserts (lack of access to nutritious affordable full-service food sources) and areas with an abundance of unhealthy food options (i.e., fast food) in LPSESPs.Prior efforts to address such issues have largely approached these challenges in piecemeal fashion, with limited success. Research on food insecurity often focuses on proximal causes and immediate needs but can do more to identify and address the root causes through a more holistic assessment and approach. We aim to systematically identify and evaluate multiple, current, best-in-class tools at community scale (our definition: within a metropolitan region with shared community geography), evaluate which tools have the most effective cost-based impact, and select a discrete set of most effective multi-domain tools. We propose a systems perspective, using structural intervention that extends across levels of the socioecological model with an explicit focus of factors further upstream. Framing our approach within a matrix of individual, sociocultural, and community levels affected by system-level resources, practices, and integrations, we will identify community barriers and facilitators to nutrition health pathways, identify and prioritize community needs, and opportunities informed by a community assessment that in turn will inform the best intervention, evaluation and dissemination practices. Over the lifespan of the proposed structural intervention, we aim to change the social, physical, and economic environments that constrain health behaviors and outcomes[NV1] , while altering the larger environmental context (i.e., neighborhood infrastructure) by which health disparities emerge and persist.Health disparities impact: Often [NV2] there is an imbalance of power and resource allocation present between the multi-level (e.g., intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, and systemic) mechanisms across the dimensions of individual and group identities like race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Structural factors impact LPSESPs differently than affluent communities, resulting in higher prevalence of food insecurity, risk of malnutrition and diet-related health disparities. At the individual level, neighborhood, culture, and family shape food access and utilization within households. Families experiencing economic instability and food insecurity will often employ food cost saving strategies such as a hierarchy in which adults in the household sacrifice their nutritional needs to make sure the children are adequately fed first. Such strategies to reduce household food costs lead to stress, anxiety, and illness. At the sociocultural level, lacking are outlets that provide culturally sensitive nutrition advice that effectively leads to achieving desired nutritional needs and goals. Although federal assistance programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) exist, Hispanic households, especially immigrants and individuals with limited English proficiency, are less likely to access them. This is due to a lack of awareness about SNAP, trouble understanding eligibility criteria, and concerns about citizenship, discrimination, and stigma[NV4]. At the community level, structural factors impede the availability of nutritionally-rich foods and channels that provide nutritious options in low-income minority neighborhoods[NV3] . Coupling this with targeted marketing of poor nutrition foods (i.e., fast food) in minority communities, contributes to misinformation about nutrition and wellness by sending the message that any food is good food.Health impact: Almost 50 million people are food insecure in the United States, which makes food insecurity one of the nations leading health and nutrition issues. Food insecurity and the lack of access to affordable nutritious food are associated with increased risk for multiple chronic diseases including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Food insecurity may also be associated with weight-related and chronic disease stigma and disease management barriers that can lead to escalating distress and other mental health impacts. Also embedded in this is misinformation about nutrition that is tied to food swamp marketing, cultural/social norms, and health-related stigma.Measuring health outcomes: Collaborating community partners and local agencies have existing data systems we will utilize to track health outcomes that are selected as relevant to evaluating the impact of the intervention on nutritional health and food insecurity. Among these data systems are client management tools that track contact points and progression pathways, Medicaid claims and encounter data from Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, Arizona Department of Health Services hospital discharge data through ASU/Knowledge Enterprise Honest Broker process, and Center for Health Information and Research (CHiR) data (a repository of comprehensive health care information and data analytics that tracks health information and information on social determinants of health from a variety of sources across the state). CHiR will collaborate with the study team to acquire, analyze and report healthcare information related to the FrescaZone Interventional Nutrition Center. We will identify metrics such as the rate of Medicaid participation as an enabling healthcare factor, the rates of diagnoses for diabetes and obesity, community health services, healthcare utilization related to diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders, as well as nutritional services use (e.g., dietician visits) and track these metrics throughout the study period. We will work with the team to develop user-friendly data visualizations and presentations to share the trends in these metrics during the full study period with community members and other stakeholders who are partners in the learning community.Potential participant reach: This grant will explore issues and conduct initial nutritional interventional work in low-income neighborhoods in east-central Phoenix, Arizona, encompassing 15 square miles, and reaching approximately 100,000 households total, utilizing a FrescaZona Interventional Nutrition Center serving the surrounding USDA Low Food Access communities. The proposed structural intervention will serve (1) racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly Hispanic/Latino families, and (2) LPSESPs who experience food insecurity in inner-city Phoenix. Based on CCFs existing work, about 95% of the youth and families to be served are people of color, with approximately 85% being Hispanic. Of those we serve, 85% report living at less than 30% of Area Median Income (an annual income of $23,000 for a family of four), 12-15% experience homelessness, and 96% of youth qualify for free/reduced school lunch.Community partner engagement plan: CCF, equipped with a seven-year track record of extensive community organization and interagency partnering, and chartered for support of one of the largest K-8 school districts in central Phoenix, will spearhead the development of a diverse representative learning community by relying on the expertise of Arizona State University as well as its own extensive network. Arizona State Universitys College of Health Solutions (ASU CHS) has valuable expertise in health and nutrition education, including the development of a broad range of community based participatory research projects like learning communities.The learning community will support evidence-based strategies to optimize system-level performance and will be inclusive of community (e.g, adult and youth community advisory board members) and agency stakeholders. To diversify voices, and create strong learning community interconnections with structures and systems, CCF intends to launch the learning community with five co-chairs who will help gather voices and administratively operate a rich learning community - Valley of the Sun United Way (non-profit, extensive community action across 1,500 metropolitan area square miles), City of Phoenix Office of Sustainability (sustainability, food systems, equity and inclusion), Arizona Food Bank Network (State-wide, food and nutrition insecurity), ASU College of Health Solutions, and CCF.As a multi-level intervention, additional community partners will be identified, but CCF has a foundation in building strong interagency community partnerships, with many partnerships with government, academic, business, and charitable organizations including a dozen additional ASU colleges and institutes, City of Phoenix and Maricopa County Public Health Department, USDA, 9 local churches, Phoenix diocese, 3 regional law firms with urban planning specialties, 3 local agriculture co-ops and producers, 12 AEC firms, 2 major grocery store corporations, 1 national marketing agency, approximately a dozen partnered local community non-profit service agencies, and over 50 institutional funding partners.ASU CHS, with whom CCF has had a close working relationship with for six years, will help with the design, instrumentation, and output of the learning community in the planning phase, and then conduct and inform the proposed structural intervention and its evaluation. Structural intervention planning: Overall, through a cyclical and iterative process the learning community will participate in intervention development meetings and focus groups in which ASU researchers will qualitatively collect data to thematically analyze stakeholder input. As part of a feedback loop, researchers will share findings with the learning community to facilitate further assessment and intervention refinements. Involving community members in the research and dissemination process promotes buy-in and investment in the communitys health.Moving in phases, we will apply a community based participatory research (CBPR) action research approach to identify and intervene on structural causes of food-related inequities towards community transformation and social change. This will entail learning community meetings and a series of focus groups. The learning community will meet to identify issues and strategies for conducting a community assessment which will be guided, in part, by intervention mapping. Data collected will be used to create matrices of needs, resources, and community behaviors to identify which should be targeted for the intervention. Next steps will be to select a theory-driven intervention method to match the determinants, refine the drafted intervention, plan for adoption, implementation, evaluation, dissemination and sustainability with community input. Throughout the collaborative efforts we will ensure the study design and approach are culturally appropriate; develop general goals and plans for implementation and evaluation through an iterative process of information sharing; gain input on the recruitment and retention of participants; gain input on the development and pre-testing of data collection tools to aid the adaptation of the process and tools to ensure they are relevant to the local context in language and culture; discuss data, especially qualitative, to gain community insights on researchers interpretation of the data; consult with community members to identify, plan and test community-delivered messaging.We aim to facilitate the following multi-level goals: Using a mixed methods systems science approach, at the individual-level we will (1) examine the depth and breadth of what and how structural factors impact food insecurity; (2) develop and test strategies that impact risks for food security and socio-protective factors that interplay with multi-level structural factors. At the socio-cultural level, (3) develop and test culturally relevant nutritional messaging, outreach materials and dissemination strategies that address compounded stigma faced by those with food insecurity. At the community-level, use implementation science frameworks (e.g., PRISM) to examine the (4) impact and sustainability of SNAP enrollment and changes to food insecurity and health behaviors at the individual and community levels and (5) the effectiveness and efficacy of our approaches impact on structural drivers at the community level to reinforce environments and social norms that support positive behavior change including improved nutritional education, quality food access, socio-protective factors, and reinforced social and built environments to sustain healthy lifestyles.Phase planning: We will develop a structural intervention using community-based participatory research and aim the form of a complex adaptive systems approach (Pinzon et al, 2022) that builds the intervention inclusive of existing practices and structures, human social behaviors, ecological systems theory, social networks, causal loops, cross-sectoral connections, changing patterns, and impacts upon actualized nutrition consumption and nutritional health over time. Specific targets for the structural intervention will be determined and prioritized by the newly established Learning Community, informed by Stage 1 semi-structured interviews. A systems evaluation framework will support community-based interventions adapted to differing public health needs while evaluating effectiveness of intended outcomes from specific actions within a system (Egan et al, 2019). An overview of this process is outlined below:Stage 1 (Year 1): Community perspective: barriers and prioritiesConduct focus groups and 1:1 semi-structured interviews with members of the CCF region to better understand barriers to current nutritional assistance programs (including but not limited to medical food boxes)topic areas to explore include awareness of local programs, individual and social perceptions related to their use/uptake, including attached stigma regarding food insecurity, weight, health status, etc, and unmet social needs contributing to current stressUtilize existing CHW roles to network and build rapport with community members to encourage participationStage 2 (Years 1-2): Establishment of Learning Community to provide directional oversight for structural interventionCCF and other CBOs to take lift for admin tasks so LC can focus on actual intervention componentsIntegration of community + CBOs with explicit target on community member identified prioritiesNeed to build community trust, build relationships across partnersCompletion of system mapping to identify leverage points for interventionemphasis on upstream factors contributing to inequityDevelopment/training/rollout of Anticipated focus on introducing new paid Peer Nutrition/Health champions (state certified CHWs with nutritional health focus)Establishing additional strategic partnerships and/or workflows to increase efficiency and sustainability of program effortse.g. working with policy makers and CBOs to establish $25 living wage for CHWs, expanding scope of CHW services eligible for reimbursement, exploring alternative payment models through community partnershipssocial network analysisStage 3 (Years 3+): implementation / evaluation (ongoing QI processes)By design, our structural intervention is likely to have components that interact to affect multiple outcomes concurrently. To navigate the complex socioecological/multilevel systems we will use broad-based strategies such as mixed method evaluation, stakeholder involvement in designing the intervention and evaluation, standardized measurement systems, effective methods to reconcile data, and rigorous modeling strategies. Learning community input will be actively solicited and applied at every stage of the design and evaluation described below. The proposed intervention will entail two primary approaches: a process evaluation and outcome evaluation. The process evaluation will assess the intervention, its components, and effectiveness. The outcome evaluation will examine the community/participant impact on short- and long-term health outcomes.Process Evaluation: We will use constructs of the Practical [NV1] Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) Framework to evaluate how the intervention interacts with the recipients (at the individual and setting levels) to influence program adoption, implementation, maintenance, reach, and effectiveness, including the external and internal contextual factors that impact the implementation and sustainability. Using mixed methods (survey instruments and focus groups), we will operationalize our process outcomes by measuring variables items like community member and CBO characteristics, type of programmatic activities, community health worker perspectives, protocols and policy development and changes, community member climate/relational assessment rating, number and type of outreach materials disseminated and community perceptions of these materials.Analysis: Statistical and thematic analyses will answer key questions: (1) Which strategies are most effective at increasing uptake and participation in the medical food box program and SNAP? (2) Which types of organizations with which types of client characteristics are most successful moving Hispanics in Phoenix closer to food security and chronic disease management? (3) Determine the number of clients sent any outreach and the number who: (a) respond in any way; (b) enroll in the intervention; and (3) complete the intervention.Outcome Evaluation: At the systems level, we will utilize data derived from the process evaluation, we will conduct system [NV1] dynamics analysis (a type of participatory modeling) to understand changes in governance network structure over time. At the individual level, health-related outcomes will be measured using a mixed methods concurrent embedded (collected simultaneously) design comprised of validated instruments and a subset of individual semi-structured interviews to examine behavioral, psychological, and social factors such as service and healthcare utilization, user perspective, clinical outcomes (chronic disease status, comorbidity index score), stigma, distress, unmet social needs. Stage 4 (Years 9-10): determine generalizability - examine contextual factors and recommendations for expanding programmatic efforts to similarly structured communities (defined as XXX) Describe plans for sustainability of research capacity and structural intervention efforts post NIH funding (revenue, billboards, general philanthropic success).CHW sustainability:CHW services now billable through AHCCCS with plans to expand eligibility to include CBOs in the next yearcontinue with advocacy efforts to increase reimbursement rate and promote livable wage for these positions (through partnership with VSUW)identification and development of partnerships to promote service integrationestablishment of public-private partnerships (Punam to speak to this?)",
FP00036375,890,,,,,1,,,"Nearly half of American adults have hypertension (high blood pressure), a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the U.S. While multiple effective anti-hypertensive (AH) drugs are widely available in the U.S, they require high (=80%) life-long medication adherence to successfully counter cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, low AH medication adherence rates and poor adherence maintenance over time are major barriers to controlled blood pressure, and the psychological barriers of present bias and forgetfulness have emerged as major contributors to low medication adherence. Incentives are effective for improving medication adherence in the short term, and may reduce present bias by helping people better internalize the future benefits of their actions, which in turn could support long-term medication adherence. However, reducing the psychological mechanism of present bias for maintaining medication adherence has not been rigorously examined, which we propose to do in this study by partnering with the widely used commercial Wellth smartphone app, where app users can earn incentives for sending photographic evidence of their pill taking. After withdrawing the incentives, we will measure adherence maintenance. Habitual pill-taking is another key strategy for long-term behavior change, since habits performed in response to the same contextual cue for roughly four months are executed with high behavioral automaticity, i.e., are performed with little or no cognitive effort. Existing habit formation interventions have had difficulty effectively supporting participants, but behavioral economics suggests that providing small incentives for cueing the new behavior can effectively support habit formation. This study therefore proposes to also adapt the Wellth app to reward cued AH pill taking. In a Stage III, 24-month 3-arm real-world efficacy trial, hypertensive adults with low (<80%) adherence from Arizona Complete Healths Medicaid plan (n=600; 200 per group) will be randomly assigned to: 1) Control group; 2) Wellth Only that will receive daily incentives for submitting a picture of their AH pill taking; or 3) Wellth+Cue that will be asked to describe the cue triggering their AH pill taking and send a second picture of the contextual cue, such as a coffee mug. A 4-month intervention will be followed by a 20-month post-intervention period to measure maintenance. The Primary Outcomes are mean AH medication adherence (days covered measured continuously via Medicaid claims) and blood pressure (via at-home readings at baseline and months 4, 8, 12, and 24). Secondary Outcomes are healthcare utilization (emergency and inpatient visits) and the costs incurred by Medicaid (via claims data). Participant and stakeholder interviews will be used to identify intervention moderators (e.g., by age, gender, race/ethnicity, or income), informing intervention refinements and cultural adaptation to prepare for Stage V implementation research in a future study. If found effective, the study has the potential for immediate scale-up for improving long-term treatment adherence for hypertension and a range of other chronic conditions.",

The main subgroups of patientsinclude:1) children with suspected auditory processing disorders, 2) elderly adults with hearingloss and 3) individuals with vestibular problems and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Auditoryprocessing may be impacted by cognitive function, it is valuable to perform cognitive screeningto make appropriate recommendations. Hearing loss in older adults is a risk factor for cognitivedecline (Lin et al., 2011) and is considered most modifiable. Appropriate and timely diagnosis,amplification, and rehabilitation may help delay cognitive decline and even dementia (Livingstonet al, 2020). Through the acquisition of appropriate equipment, materials and training to performcognitive screening, we will implement cognitive screenings for aging adults and use the resultsto make appropriate referrals and tailor interventions. Similarly, pre-and post surgery cognitiveassessments in patients with vestibular disorders will also be helpful for predicting theperformance and evaluating the benefits of cochlear implants. Recent advances in the evaluationof balance and vestibular function in conjunction with cognitive function have led to apartnership between major players in both arenas: Cognivue and the American Institute ofBalance (AIB).

FP00036403,893,,,,,1,,,"Arizona faces alarming disparities in severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality (SMM&MM), with Native American, Black/African American, and Latinx communities experiencing the highest rates. Factors associated with SMM&MM include substance use disorder, mental health conditions, obesity, continuity and quality of care. In response, Arizonas Medicaid office will expand postpartum coverage from 60 days to 365 days. Medicaids approach will lead to a variety of supplemental initiatives, and concurrently create a need to understand which supplemental initiative is most effective to reducing SMM&MM. For common causes of death in the late postpartum period (>42 days), such as poisonings associated with substance use and suicide, no comprehensive measures exist. We propose to leverage the Medicaid expansion to collect evidence to design a structural intervention targeting issues that most directly affect postpartum women experiencing healthcare disparities and develop comprehensive measures assessing maternal health during the late postpartum period. We will do this by examining the statewide effects of the Medicaid expansion for increases in utilization of preventive care and mental health support; decreases in emergency/urgent care/hospitalizations; and birth outcome improvements. We will assess variability by race/ethnicity and state region to examine patterns and detect areas successful in improving outcomes. Then, we will implement a structural intervention to address ongoing barriers to culturally appropriate, comprehensive postpartum care access. This project will assess the impact of Medicaids supplemental initiatives on the patient and the health system, advance our understanding of mechanisms that create effective solutions for reducing SMM&MM in Native American, Black/African American, and Latinx communities, and develop comprehensive measurements of maternal health in the postpartum period.",
FP00036425,894,,,,,1,,,"The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a community- led approach to co-create a program to identify and reduce structural barriers to health equity through the distinct program phases of design, implementation and evaluation.  The purpose of this project is to improve health equity in vulnerable children, families, and communities using a community-based partnership model to address structural barriers that disproportionately impact such communities. To accomplish the project goal, the Cultural Wellness Center (CWC) will partner with the College of Health (CHS) at Arizona State University (ASU) to work with community partners to conduct a pilot project to identify key structural barriers related to the disparities created in the child protection system (CPS) in Minnesota. Such structural barriers are known to result in the disproportionate removal of African American children from families, thereby adversely impacting resilience and life long health and well-being outcomes for the child and family. Based on findings from the pilot, the project team will develop strategies and practices to mitigate the identified structural barriers to improve health equity in the affected children, families, and community.  The ASU subaward will be led by Dr. William Riley, PhD and will serve as the research partner to  support the CWCs application to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) opportunity to participate in the  Community Partnerships to Advance Science for Society (ComPASS) to develop, share, and evaluate community-led health equity structural interventions that leverage partnerships across multiple sectors to reduce health disparities and  develop a new health equity research model for community-led, multisectoral structural intervention research.ASU will assist CWC in developing a community-based multi sectoral partnership built on the principles of cultural self-study and cultural interfacing. The team will prepare a National Institutes of Health (NIH) draft with  structural intervention research strategy to plan,as well as develop and establish a Community-Led, Health Equity Structural Intervention (CHESIs). CWC and ASU will undertake a pilot project that utilizes the structural barriers identified by the multi sectoral partnership to address  one of the structural interventions focusing on health equity and quantifying the impact of the barriers. Based on community needs, the team will identify solutions involving structural interventions to reduce disparities within the child protection system. ASU will lead the development of the structural intervention research strategy which will  include the research study design, statistical analysis plan and outcome assessment plan.",
FP00036430,895,,,,,1,,,"Stress responses such as psychosocial stress involve both central and peripheral systems, particularly the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA axis), and the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. Overstimulation of the HPA axis and high levels of the stress hormone cortisol are associated with many disorders such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Heat stress responses are different from psychosocial stress and include both challenge and threat that not only activate the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system, which releases hormones to increase heart rate and dilate blood vessels, but also strongly activate the HPA axis, which produces the stress hormone cortisol. To our knowledge, the brain and physiological effects, as well as cognitive effects, of heat stress are not well understood. Similarly, biomarkers of heat stress resilience are also poorly defined. In this two-year project, we propose to address two research gaps and problems related to heat stress conditions: 1) how acute heat stress impacts central and peripheral physiology as well as cognitive performance 2) identifying central and peripheral biomarkers of heat stress resilience. We will use multi-level methodological approaches  neuroimaging, psychophysiology, metabolism, and brain state training (Integrative Body-Mind Training, IBMT) to accomplish these aims. We will conduct two studies, each involving 15 health subjects. In the first study, 15 subjects will participate in a controlled heat stress environment to examine stress effects (Gap 1). In the second study, 15 subjects will receive ten 30 min sessions of IBMT to improve stress resilience, allowing us to identify biomarkers of heat stress resilience (Gap 2). NIH recommended behavioral measures, physiological measures, brain metabolism and plasticity measures will be used to assess stress response and resilience at baseline (pre) & post-2-wk-intervention. We hypothesize that heat stress will lead to more sympathetic activity, greater brain resting activity in hypothalamus and amygdala and reduced cognitive performance such as attention, working memory and problem solving. Stress resilience will produce improvements in cognitive performance supported by greater activity and plasticity in brain self-control and reward networks such as anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent prefrontal cortex (ACC/mPFC), and ACC-Striatum connectivity.Our proposed research will advance the understanding of stress regulation and resilience, impact design and implementation of programs that aim to enhance performance under heat stress, and provide key information for developing optimal training regimens in stressful and competitive situations, particularly those involved in US Navy and Marine Corps operations. Therefore, the science and technology advancement proposed in the study is of particular value to the US Navy and Marine Corps.",

FP00036463,897,,,,,1,,,"Safe Routes to School (SRTS) is a federally funded, evidence-based program that targets programming and changes to the built environment to improve safety and increase walking to school, supporting public health guidance to increase active travel as a source of physical activity to reduce chronic disease. This is particularly critical in lower-income communities where rates of physical inactivity and obesity among youth, and rates of pedestrian injury and fatality are disproportionately high due to poor infrastructure for walking. SRTS is most effective with built environment improvements; however environmental changes require knowledge of engineering guidelines  expertise that school/community members generally lack. Partnering communities with engineers can provide technical assistance to overcome barriers to SRTS and may improve utilization of funds, particularly in lower-income communities most in need of environmental improvements. Increased walking through SRTS environmental changes fosters social interaction and psychological connection - key elements of social connectedness. This natural experiment compares the implementation (including built environment changes); effect on safety, active travel, and social connectedness; and costs of SRTS with/without engineering technical assistance.SRTS is a multicomponent program that includes programming targeting behavior change and safety improvements to the built environment. Infrastructure improvements have the largest impact on travel behavior change; yet, altering the built environment requires specialized knowledge which is universally challenging but particularly problematic for lower-income communities with limited resources. Lower-income communities are most in need of environmental improvements, however, as residents are less likely to encounter traffic calming measures, crosswalks, or sidewalks which contribute to disproportionately high pedestrian deaths and unsafe school trips. Pedestrian injury is a major health inequity and leading cause of child death. Integrating engineering experts can facilitate SRTS, including environmental changes, to improve safety and increase active school travel in our most under-resourced communities, increasing opportunities for social interaction and support among neighbors to facilitate social connectedness. This natural experiment uses an open-cohort design with concurrent mixed methods to test SRTS implementation (Aim 1), effect on safety, prevalence of active travel, and social connectedness (Aim 2), and cost (Aim 3) between eight intervention schools receiving engineering technical assistance and eight comparison schools receiving SRTS as usual in Phoenix (AZ). Findings from this study will provide practice-based evidence of the feasibility and impact of offering engineering technical assistance to further SRTS as a public health strategy and mitigate health disparities with large scale impact on childrens health.",

This is accomplished by facilitating a state-wide learning network that connects a team of subject matter experts in the clinical treatment of OUD with primary care providers in live, virtual teleECHO clinics. The topics of these teleECHO clinics cover the clinical best-practices for the management of OUD, including prescription and illicit opioid use, across all age groups. Specifically, the year-long curriculum will address the intersection of OUD and mental health, particularly as it pertains to the impacts of COVID-19 and youth.Although the primary focus of the MOUD ECHO is to increase the capacity of primary care providers and improve patient access to quality OUD treatment services, we have uncovered a potentially unique secondary benefit from our experiences operating and evaluating Project ECHO programs. Participating medical providers have self-reported improvements across measures of clinician wellness after participating in their respective ECHO programs. On average, we have seen improved reported scores on overall job satisfaction and ability to meet their patients needs, while simultaneously reporting decreases in provider burnout. Although a direct correlation cannot be drawn and further research needs to be conducted, it does suggest that participation in ECHO programming could provide protective factors influencing the mental health of our healthcare workforce itself.

The model leverages video conferencing technology to connect Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant5Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American Universityteams of specialists with local primary care providers in real-time, collaborative sessions. Using proven adult learning techniques, these sessions employ case-based learning and mentorship to increase provider knowledge and confidence to treat increasingly complex patients. The Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) ECHO first launched in February 2020 to address the increasing demand for providers who are qualified, capable, and willing to treat patients with OUD. The idea was first brought forth by BCBS after operationalizing a state-wide campaign to get providers buprenorphine waivered. Although this campaign was successful in increasing the number of waivered providers, only a small percentage integrated MOUD into their practices. Many providers referenced a lingering gap in knowledge and confidence to treat OUD patients, as well as persistent stigma towards the patient population. Thus, ASU partnered with BCBS to develop the MOUD ECHO to provide ongoing technical support to providers. During the period of performance (June 1, 2023  May 31, 2024), we will deliver 24 sessions, all focused on the cross section of OUD and mental health. These sessions will be led by a team of 8 interdisciplinary subject matter experts (SMEs) representing family medicine, addiction medicine, addiction psychiatry, clinical psychology, pharmacy, social work, and harm reduction. We will provide free continuing medical education credits for medical, nursing, psychology, pharmacy, social work, as well as interprofessional credits. We aim to reach over 300 unique participants, average over 50 attendees per session, and deliver over 1,200 hours of free professional development. Lastly, we aim to achieve a mean session satisfaction rate of greater than 90% overall.More than 630,000 people died to drug overdose in the U.S. between 1999 and 2016, 66% of which involved an opioid. This trend has only accelerated since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Preliminary data indicates more than 105,000 opioid-related deaths in 2021 alone, likely due to factors such as social isolation, interruptions to effective treatment plans, and the increased prevalence of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Although there are effective medications available, many primary care physicians are reluctant to prescribe buprenorphine significantly restricting patient access to care. Disparities in access to treatment, satisfaction with treatment efficacy, and challenges with treatment completion continue to persist. Patients with OUD also report negative experiences with provider communication in the primary care setting. Thus, our aim is to increase the knowledge, confidence, and support available to primary care providers across Arizona to increase the system-level capacity to treat patients with OUD.Problem Addressed* Describe the problem your project is addressing.Population Description* Please define the population served and the need in the community. Please include if these populations would be eligible for other funding sources such as Medicaid, Medicare, Private Insurance, etc., for any portion of the proposed services indicated within this application.Arizona has 126 Primary Care Areas (PCAs), 82 considered a Arizona Medically Underserved Area (AzMUA). The Arizona State Department of Health Biennial Report scored the PCA scores on the Primary Care Index ranged from 1 to 54, out of a possible 65 points. Six of the top ten highest need PCAs based on this index are tribal areas: White Mountain Apache Tribe, Navajo Nation, Colorado River Indian Tribe, Hualapai Tribe, San Carlos Apache Tribe, and Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation. In addition, three of out the top six are located in Maricopa County: Glendale Central, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, and South Mountain Village & Guadalupa. Arizona ranks in the bottom half of all states for four measures: clinical care (ranked 39); social/economic factors; health outcomes (ranked 29); and physical environment (ranked 26). Arizona also ranked in the bottom half for numbers of inhabitants with a dedicated health care provider. The overall rate of uninsured residents in Maricopa County was 13.3%. However, when adjusting for race and ethnicity, these rates increase substantially: 41% among Hispanics, 20% among African Americans; 19% among Native Americans; and 17% among Asians.Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant6Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American UniversityProject Activities* Describe the activities to address the identified issue/problem.The MOUD ECHO program will host 24 individual teleECHO sessions during the period of performance.

The model leverages that primary care providers are not limited in their ability to treat complex patients by their licenses or healthcare regulations, they are limited by their training and clinical confidence. The literature supports that tele-mentoring models can effectively train generalist providers, particularly those already living and working in rural or underserved areas to work at a higher scope of practice. This could prove to be particularly powerful in the fight to reduce health disparities across the country, particularly those geographically bound. Furthermore, research supports primary care providers participating in the ECHO model can provide safe and effective treatment, and can produce better patient outcomes with lower adverse events than referring to specialists for the same treatment. This is thought to be attributed to the models inherent ability to address many common access barriers relevant to rural communities including transportation barriers, cultural or language barriers, and established provider trust.

In this way, Project ECHO can provide a unique advantage over telemedicine by improving community access to essential healthcare services. Furthermore, research shows that primary care providers who participate in tele-mentoring programs report a higher overall satisfaction. In fact, current participants in our MOUD ECHO program report a mean increase in their overall job satisfaction from 3.93 to 4.16, and in their ability to meet their patients needs from 3.93 to 4.16, on a 5-point Likert scale.Since ASU is not an academic medical center, we are somewhat limited in our ability to recruit clinical subject matter experts internally. Therefore, we collaborate with community partners extensively to provide the expertise for our programming. In 2022, we partnered with 21 organizations across the United States, listed below: Arizona Society of Addiction MedicineArizona Poison and Drug Information Center HonorHealthVeterans Affairs Healthcare SystemSouthwest Recovery AllianceStratis HealthValleywise HealthUniversity of Central Florida School of MedicineUniversity of Texas Department of Health SciencesIPC HealthcareCrisis Response NetworkDignity HealthValle Del SolEl Rio HealthSustainability* Describe what your organization will do to sustain the projects activities and/or services after Foundation funding ends.  As a shared responsibility to democratize medical knowledge and disseminate best-practices across the healthcare workforce, the ECHO community at large is committed to providing all programming free of charge. In addition, we provide free CME/CEU credits whenever possible. As such, there is not now, nor ever projected to be a sustainable financial model built within Project ECHO itself. With that said, many ECHO programs, including the BHI ECHO program, operate over the course of years with no anticipated end dates, simply because there is a need. As the founder of Project ECHO states, ECHO is a project of the willing. Since ASU began offering ECHO programming in 2020, we have operationalized our programs through a combination of external funding received from national level organizations to state-run insurance providers to support from family foundations in combination with internal support from ASU leadership. As we would move forward beyond the life of this grant, we will continue to partner with organizations who share our same collective mindset to make continuing professional development accessible, affordable, and in alignment with the needs of our communities.Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant8Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American UniversitySuccess Measures and ReportingProposed Goals* Describe the expected outcomes using SMART  specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-oriented  goals. Be sure to detail how outcomes will be measured and reported using both quantitative and qualitative measures.The BHI ECHO program has 4 program objectives: 1. Enhance knowledge SMART GOAL: after one-year, 90% of participants will be knowledgeable or very knowledgeable in describing clinical best practices surrounding medications for opioid use disorder.2.Increase Confidence SMART GOAL: after one-year, 80% of participants will be confident or very confident in treating patients with opioid use disorder in the primary care setting, including those with co-occuring mental health conditions.3. Change Practice Behaviors SMART GOAL: after one-year, 70% of participating providers will increase opioid use disorder treatment services available within their practicesIncrease Capacity4. SMART GOAL: after one-year, 80% of participating providers will demonstrate an increased capacity to treat patients with opioid use disorder by increasing the number of OUD patients treated within their local practice.These program outcomes will be analyzed in accordance with ASU Project ECHOs Monitoring and Evaluation plan. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected through the administration of two surveys. First, a post-session survey will be disseminated after each individual teleECHO session and will collect data on overall session satisfaction, knowledge, confidence, practice behavior change, as well as data pertaining to CME accreditation standards (i.e. material was presented free of commercial bias, etc.). The second survey will be a retroactive-pre-post survey administered at the 6- and 12- month intervals of program operations. This survey will collect more in depth data relating to self-reported changes in knowledge, confidence, practice behaviors, and overall clinician wellness measures comparing before and after participation in the ECHO program. Both surveys will collect qualitative data that will include perceived benefits of the program/session. Lastly, participant demographics will also be collected through both surveys as well as through the program registration process.The outputs measured through this program will include:  Number of session held Number of didactics presented, number of cases presented Number of individual participants and clinical sites attending Number of Arizona counties represented among participating providers Number of participants attending from Medically Underserved Areas in Arizona Participant demographics (name, credentials, practice setting, location, contact information) Clinic demographics (organization name, location, practice type) Number of learning hours delivered Number to CME/CEU credits dispersed Participant satisfaction rates CME accreditation specific measures (i.e. information presented free of commercial bias, opportunity provided to ask questions, etc.) Relevance of material discussed to participants medical practicesProposed Outputs* Detail the metrics that will be tracked as part of the progress towards the outcomes.Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant9Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American University Average number of patients with diagnosed opioid use disorder being treated within their practice Average number of patients with diagnosed opioid use disorder being referred outside of their practice Integration of team-based care in the primary care setting Self-reported changes in:Various measures of clinical knowledgeVarious measures of clinical confidenceIntegration of content learned into their medical practiceo Overall job satisfactionValue of clinical practiceo Ability to meet patients needsProvider burnout Program fidelity (how well the MOUD ECHO program adheres to the standards set forth by the ECHO Institute).oooooDemonstrated Outcomes To Date Include evidence of existing data and outcomes that support the efficacy and/or impact of the proposed activities (if applicable).Since February 2020, our team has developed 10 healthcare-based ECHO programs, collectively delivering 359 live, teleECHO sessions to 2,251 unique participants, totaling 12,190 learning hours of free CME. This breaks out to an average of one teleECHO session hosted every 3 days. Furthermore, to support these operations, we have been awarded over $2.1 million in external funding in our first 3 years of operation. Average attendance per session across all programming is 40.4 with an average reported satisfaction rate of 4.68 (5-point Likert scale, 5=extremely satisfied; n=2,923). The most common known professional backgrounds of participants attending ASU Project ECHO programs (n=684) are nurses (BSN, RN, etc.) making up 35% of all participants. Physicians (MD, DO), advanced practice providers (PA, NP), and behavioral health providers (PsyD, LMSW, etc.) are the next most common at 21%, 19%, and 18% respectively. Participant attendances were logged from 45 US states, the District of Columbia, and five countries (n=11,220) including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, and Egypt. Since its initial launch in February 2020, the MOUD ECHO has never ceased operation and continues to meet biweekly. To date, we have delivered a total of 71 teleECHO sessions to 587 individual learners for a total of 2,768 learning hours of free continuing medical education. Participants in the current MOUD ECHO program report increases in all measures of knowledge and confidence assessed. Specifically participants report a mean increase from 3.09 to 4.00 on their knowledge about medications to treat opioid use disorder (5-point Likert scale). Furthermore, participants also reported mean increases in their confidence to provide comprehensive opioid use disorder treatment from 2.95 to 3.70 (5-point Likert scale). In 2022, the average session satisfaction rate for the MOUD ECHO was 4.68 out of 5 (n=455).Organizational Infrastructure* Describe the organizational infrastructure and roles of staff members currently in place to support the proposed grant activities.*Note: If staff needs to be hired to implement the proposed activities, please provide a hiring timeline and onboarding process.Adrienne Madhavpeddi, MS oversee development and delivery including monitoring and evaluation, grant management, program operations, staffing, program fidelity.

FP00036478,899,,,,,1,,,"Digital twin refers to a digital replica of a physical asset, living entity, or biological process. The idea to create a digital twin has been around for decades and has been realized in manufacturing, in particular in automobile and aerospace industries. By creating a digital twin, designers can monitor the behavior of an entity, assess its performance, simulate its behavior prior to manufacturing, and gather insights that guide the automation of complex processes. While digital twin technologies have been in use in many domains, their application in healthcare is in its infancy. By creating a digital replica of a behavioral and biological process, we can perform health assessment, simulate treatments, and measure health outcome trajectories through the digital twin prior to implementing new treatments. We aim to realize this vision by designing a digital twin library for glucose control in people with prediabetes. A digital twin focused on glycemic control must deliver three functions including modeling of the glucose response, automation of behavioral interventions, and simulation of alternative and new interventions. We hypothesize that by integrating multimodal sensor data, prior domain knowledge, machine learning, sequential decision making, and natural language processing we can construct a digital twin library that models glycemic response, predicts optimal lifestyle interventions, allows for simulating interventions through computation-based interaction with the digital twin. To design and evaluate our digital twin technologies, we will use historical data as well as data that will be collected in a 5-week-long user study involving 100 people with prediabetes. In Aim 1, we will design machine learning algorithms that model glycemic response from multimodal sensor data while addressing challenges of missing sensor modalities during inference and irregularly sampled sensors. In Aim 2, we will design a decision-making approach that leverages advances in Social Cognitive Theory and linear optimization to provide health eating interventions. In Aim 3, we will design a simulation framework that uses advances in knowledge representation and reasoning to model behavioral pathways for glucose control and encode this model into reasoning algorithms for simulating behavioral modifications that enhance glucose control. The proposed user study is a feasibility trial that will provide us with the necessary data for the design and evaluation of the prediction algorithms in Aim 1 and reasoning techniques in Aim 3 while providing data about feasibility of using AI techniques for automating behavioral interventions.",
FP00036511,900,,,,,1,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic pain affects over one third of the U.S. population and is a leading cause of disability. Long-term opioid therapy (LtOT), characterized by 90 or more days of opioid use, is still being utilized as a common chronic pain management strategy, despite its numerous health risks, including development of opioid use disorder. Accessible and safe treatments that can reduce pain and the need for extended opioid exposure are urgently needed. Mindfulness-based therapies (MBTs) that target enhancing present-moment attention, non-judgmental awareness, and acceptance, are some of the first-line mind-body interventions for chronic pain. However, the overall effects of MBTs on pain-related outcomes are small-to-moderate in size. Recent mechanistic studies have suggested that mindfulness reduces pain via non-opioid mechanisms. Thus, integration of an MBT with a safe, non-opioid intervention that can modulate endogenous opioid system, which serves an important role in pain relief, may produce synergistic effects. Open-label placebo (OLP)non-deceptive placebois a promising, safe, and ethical intervention for chronic pain that can be combined with an MBT. Mechanistic studies have also demonstrated that placebo-analgesia is mediated by the release of endogenous opioids. Thus, there is strong justification to hypothesize that combining an MBT and OLP treatment may produce more powerful and enduring effects for improving chronic pain than when an MBT or OLP treatment are implemented alone. This R34 study proposes a single-site 2x2 factorial randomized-controlled trial that evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of combining an online MBT previously developed by our study team and evaluated for efficacy, and OLP treatment for individuals with chronic pain receiving LtOT. A total of 60 participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following 4 conditions for a 6-week trial: (1) an online MBT; (2) OLP treatment that will be layered onto participants current LtOT regimen; (3) combination of the online MBT and OLP treatment; and (4) treatment as usual. The feasibility of conducting the proposed trial will be determined by: (1) participant retention rate from baseline to 3-month follow-up, (2) adherence to online MBT, (3) adherence to OLP treatment monitored by a smart pillbox and detection of urinary riboflavin tracer in mid- and post-treatment sessions; and (4) compliance on ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The acceptability of combining an online MBT and OLP treatment will be determined by self-report ratings of (1) treatment satisfaction, (2) intervention effectiveness, (3) intervention convenience, (4) side effects, and (5) appropriateness of intervention and EMA length and frequency. The long-term goal of this study is to improve chronic pain management and prevent problematic opioid use among millions of persons living with chronic pain. The proposed study will serve as the critical first step to establishing procedures and strategies that comprehensively evaluate a combined online MBT and OLP treatment in a future fully-powered multi-site clinical trial.",
FP00036536,901,,,,,1,,,"Older adults with depression are 5x more likely to exhibit elevated autistic traits than non-depressed, and those with subclinical, elevated autistic traits (~25% of the population; aka the Broad Autism Phenotype [BAP]) experience higher rates of depression than those with lower traits. We and others have shown that both in person and mHealth adaptions of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) improve depression in autistic and older adults. Mobile MBI apps are highly accessible; however, adherence is poor due to declining motivation and forgetfulness. Establishing habitual app meditation may be a key strategy for improving adherence because habits are reliably performed with little or no cognitive effort. In our previous research, we found pairing app meditation with an existing routine, an approach called Anchoring, improved long-term adherence and depression reduction in autistic and non-autistic adults. Moreover, the effect size for app adherence was substantially larger among autistic adults than the similar study we conducted with non-autistic adults. We hypothesize this is because of the increased reliance on routine associated with autism, which is also a feature of BAP. In this proposal, we will build on these promising findings by evaluating a meditation app anchoring intervention among the vulnerable group of late-life depressed individuals, and we will systematically evaluate the moderating effect of BAP. Our intervention is entirely remote to address healthcare access issues relevant to Arizona. We will provide preliminary evidence of an effective and scalable mHealth intervention that will positively impact precision mental health for older adults and the vulnerable BAP population.",

FP00036558,903,,,,,1,,," Project Summary/Abstract The  goal  of  the  this  proposal  is  to  improve  oropharyngeal  cancer  screening  through  the  rigorous  validation  of  salivary biomarkers.  The  scientific  approach  of  our  program  is  based  on  several  fundamental  principles.   First,  that  human papillomaviral (HPV) infection and persistence induces carcinogenesis in the oropharynx over decades, generating well-documented circulating and salivary viral nucleic acid and serologic biomarkers. These biomarkers have not yet been tested in rigorous, prospective studies with centralized CLIA/CAP biomarker validation. Second, the low incidence requires that effective screening paradigms for oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) use novel systems for large-scale prospective studies using self-collection  sampling,  digital  enrollment,  and  distributive  systems  to  enable  enrollment  in  underserved  communities. Third, that the clinical management of positive biomarkers be rigorously addressed. Our proposal builds on our extensive experiences  with  cancer  biomarker  development,  verification,  validation,  innovative  clinical  study  management,  and expertise in HPV oropharyngeal cancer screening. Our previous results on HPV serologic biomarkers have been confirmed in blinded phase 2 multicenter validation studies. Our results have shown that multiplexed panels of IgG antibodies for HPV16 are required for adequate predictive value. Our Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC. (MSD) team has fielded over 3,000 instruments  worldwide,  and  over  700  commercially  available  biomarker  assay  kits.  Their  expertise  at  serologic  assay development led to one of their V-PLEX serology panels being selected by Operation Warp Speed as the basis of its standard binding assays for immunogenicity assessments in all funded Phase III clinical trials of COVID vaccines. We will use the MSD MULTI-ARRAY platform to migrate the HPV serologic markers for target clinical applications in saliva. This represents an ongoing collaboration with experts in large-scale self-collection salivary biomarker screening at Arizona State University, experts on head and neck cancer screening at Baylor University Medical Center, and AT Still University (ATSU) School  of  Dentistry  &  Oral  Health.  We  will  generate  high-quality  well-characterized  samples  to  validate  circulating  and salivary  biomarkers  to  enhance  oropharyngeal  cancer  screening.  Adhering  to  the  principles  of  PRoBE  design,  we  will perform Phase 2 validation of HPV serology and nucleic acid testing with cancer patient and control sera and saliva, followed by developing and testing the methodology needed to conduct a prospective Phase 4 salivary screening study. We will provide a resource for expertise and clinical repository for the rigorous validation of salivary and circulating biomarkers for cancer screening.  ",
FP00036560,904,,,,,1,,,"Judith Klein-Seetharaman (JKS) will collaborate closely with Dr. Weiner on cataloguing the peri-implantation plasma transcriptome in humans. Specifically, we will determine the 1st trimester plasma cell free transcriptome and analyze the results with sophisticated bioinformatics and machine learning tools to carry out RNA Marker Discovery. JKS is committed to carry out the following work, as proposed:1.RNA library generation and RNAseq. Using the RNA extraction protocol provided by Rosetta Signaling Laboratory, RNA will be extracted from 5 groups of IVF patients from the Helen Schneider Hospital for Women at the Rabin Medical Center with 5 groups of known pregnancy outcomes at 4 time points in the 1st trimester and submitted to TGen across the street in downtown Phoenix. The libraries and RNAseq will be performed in the genomics core of TGen.2.Pathway analysis with Ingenuity. We will use Ingenuity software to infer causal networks from the RNAseq data. 3.Pathway analysis of time-series relationships. JKS will supervise all network modeling and pathway analysis of the RNAseq data. She will apply dynamic functional pathway analysis to gain mechanistic insight into the possible causes and functional consequences of DE PCF RNAs in the peri-implantation transcriptome. The RNAseq data allows us not only to analyze expression changes at each time point, but also to study their progression over time. Analyzing such data offers computational challenges but also opportunities for inferring causality from the temporal response pattern. 3a. STEM. Given the small number of time points, the first step will be to subject gene expression data to STEM software to cluster, compare, and visualize the data and assist its interpretation through integration with the Gene Ontology (GO). 3b. DREM. We will use DREM software to identify associated transcription factors (TFs). 3c. SDREM. We will connect TF responses to cellular signal transduction pathways using SDREM connecting DE genes to a either a + or - stimulus. 4.Pathway analysis using KEGG. We will carry out transcriptomic pathway using the KEGG reference library. 4a. Correlation network modelling (i.e., where pathways and features are set to nodes and edges, respectively) will be used to understand non-hierarchical relationships between key features in the RNA dataset. 4b. Feature Selection. Depending on the proportion of variance explained, key features will be selected to define the network nodes, either by selecting features that vary significantly (i.e., p< 0.05) across experimental groups using differential analysis, or by performing multivariate dimension reduction to find sets of features that are both highly connected within experimental groups and highly associated across timepoints. 4c. Pathway heatmapping will be performed to visualize relationships between samples and RNA clusters across multiple relevant pathways. First, cluster analysis will be performed on the samples by assessing covariance. Next, interactive heatmaps will be placed side-by-side to allow visual identification and subsequent enrichment analysis of features that correspond to either the detected clusters or the experimental groups. 4d. Standard hierarchical clustering methods can also be applied to both the features and samples, enabling the mapping of clusters to human pathways. 4e. Dimensionality reduction will allow us to identify the top 20 features from each component will be selected based on loading scores and the pairwise similarity of selected RNAs will be computed to define the network edges. 4f. Downstream edge and node filters such as inversion and adjacent feature selection may further refine the network with the objective of visually exploring significance values and corresponding pathway impact scores, loadings and biplots in interactive 3D scatter plots to understand the common trends and underlying patterns using data-dependent cutoffs.",
FP00036566,905,,,,,1,,,"Poor diet-related health outcomes are highly prevalent in the U.S. with disproportionate risk among households experiencing food insecurity. It is therefore important to consider not only access to sufficient quantity of food, but also the quality of food. In this project, we will assess predictors of household nutrition security, defined as consistent access to affordable, nutritious foods, among low-income households with at least one child under the age of five through two specific aims: (1) Evaluate the association between nutrition security and food security and assess if participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP] and/or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC] moderates this relationship. (2) Evaluate the association between nutrition security and amount of food assistance benefits for households participating in SNAP and/or WIC. We hypothesize that associations will be strongest among households participating in WIC, given the programs more targeted focus on nutrition security. We will collect primary survey data from a national sample of 612 respondents using validated scales to capture food and nutrition security over the last 12 months and other key variables. Findings may provide evidence for improved benefit adequacy and the redesign of programs to improve healthy food access.",

This is accomplished by facilitating a state-wide learning network that connects a team of subject matter experts in behavioral health with primary care providers in live, virtual teleECHO clinics. The topics[CE1] [AW2] covered include the clinical best-practices for the management of mental illness, including severe mental illness, across the life-span. Specifically, the year-long curriculum will cover five key topic areas including access, suicide prevention, youth mental health, the intersection of mental health and substance-use disorder, and the effect of COVID-19 on those with new and pre-existing mental health diagnoses. Our team will implement the Behavioral Health Integration ECHO Program for primary care providers in Arizona across leveraging the Project ECHO model to establish a learning collaborative to scale evidence-based education and best-practices in mental health treatment.Although the primary focus of the Behavioral Health Integration ECHO is to increase the capacity of primary care providers and improve patient access to quality mental health services, we have uncovered a potentially unique secondary benefit from our experiences operating and evaluating Project ECHO programs. Participating medical providers have self-reported improvements across measures of clinician wellness after participating in their respective ECHO programs. On average, we have seen improved reported scores on overall job satisfaction and ability to meet their patients needs, while simultaneously reporting decreases in provider burnout. Although a direct correlation cannot be drawn and further research needs to be conducted, it does suggest that participation in ECHO programming could provide protective factors influencing the mental health of our healthcare workforce itself.Program SupportImprove access to mental health services across Arizona by increasing the capacity of primary care providers diagnosing and treating mental health conditions in their local clinics.Project Secondary Focus* Describe any additional focus areas being addressed (e.g., substance use disorder, health equity).Desired Outcome* Please describe the desired outcome in 1-2 sentences.Project Type* Request DetailsProject Name* Behavioral Health Integration ECHOPrinted On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant4Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American UniversityAmount of Funding Requested* Counties Served* What county(s) does the proposed project serve?Community Served* What population(s) will be served with the requested funds?$124,929.00Children, Youth and FamiliesAdultsUnshelteredTribalVeteransSeniorsStudentsOtherApache CountyCochise CountyCoconino CountyGila CountyGraham CountyGreenlee CountyLa Paz CountyMaricopa CountyMohave CountyNavajo CountyPima CountyPinal CountySanta Cruz CountyYavapai CountyYuma CountyTarget: All regions of AZ, including rural and underserved areas.

Using proven adult learning techniques, these sessions employ case-based learning and mentorship to increase provider knowledge and confidence to treat increasingly complex patients. The Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) ECHO program first launched in April 2020 as a direct response to increased demands for behavioral health services being sought by both patients and healthcare workforces alike. Initially, the program focused on supporting behavioral health providers navigate the rapidly changing healthcare environment, share emerging best practices and co-develop strategies for delivering mental health services via telehealth, and disseminate approaches for providing support to their local healthcare workforces. During the period of performance (June 1, 2023  May 31, 2024), we will deliver 24 sessions in the BHI ECHO program with all sessions focused specifically on mental health. These sessions will be led by a team of 5 interdisciplinary subject matter experts representing family medicine, clinical psychology, neuropsychology, pediatrics, pharmacy, and addiction medicine. We will provide free continuing medical education credits (1-credit per session) for medical, nursing, psychology, pharmacy, social work, as well as inter-professional credits. We aim to reach over 300 unique participants representing providers at the primary care level, average over 50 attendees per session, and deliver over 1,200 hours of free professional development. Lastly, we aim to achieve a mean session satisfaction rate of greater than 90% overall.     [CE1]Exceeds by 100 characters   [AW2]Now 1,904Arizona ranks 35th nationwide for access to mental health treatment and 49th overall for youth mental health treatment. Patients in Arizona often rely on primary care providers to address their mental health concerns. In fact, up to 60% of patients with behavioral health problems are treated solely in the primary care setting, while nearly 80% of antidepressant medications are prescribed by primary care providers, and these are pre-pandemic figures. Studies show that now over 50% of the general population rate the psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic as moderate or severe. The distribution of the healthcare workforce, particularly specialists, is becoming increasingly centralized within urban areas across the US. Not surprisingly, this trend is accompanied by a widening gap in health disparities among patients in rural areas. However, when analyzing the geographic dispersion of primary care providers, the distribution per capita is more equitable. Thus, an opportunity exists to leverage primary care teams to treat more complex patients in local communities  a movement, that if leveraged appropriately, could significantly increase patient access to mental health services.

The Arizona State Department of Health Biennial Report scored the PCA scores on the Primary Care Index ranged from 1 to 54, out of a possible 65 points. Six of the top ten highest need PCAs based on this index are tribal areas: White Mountain Apache Tribe, Navajo Nation, Colorado River Indian Tribe, Hualapai Tribe, San Carlos Apache Tribe, and Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation. In addition, three of out the top six are located in Maricopa County: Glendale Central, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, and South Mountain Village & Guadalupa. Arizona ranks in the bottom half of all states for four measures: clinical care (ranked 39); social/economic factors; health outcomes (ranked 29); and physical environment (ranked 26). Arizona also ranked in the bottom half for numbers of inhabitants with a dedicated health care provider. The overall rate of uninsured residents in Maricopa County was 13.3%. However, when adjusting for race and ethnicity, these rates increase substantially: 41% among Hispanics, 20% among African Americans; 19% among Native Americans; and 17% among Asians.Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant6Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American UniversityProject Activities* Describe the activities to address the identified issue/problem.The B HI ECHO program will host 24 individual teleECHO sessions during the period of performance.

The model leverages that primary care providers are not limited in their ability to treat complex patients by their licenses or healthcare regulations, they are limited by their training and clinical confidence. The literature supports that tele-mentoring models can effectively train generalist providers, particularly those already living and working in rural or underserved areas to work at a higher scope of practice. This could prove to be particularly powerful in the fight to reduce health disparities across the country, particularly those geographically bound. Furthermore, research supports primary care providers participating in the ECHO model can provide safe and effective treatment, and can produce better patient outcomes with lower adverse events than referring to specialists for the same treatment. This is thought to be attributed to the models inherent ability to address many common access barriers relevant to rural communities including transportation barriers, cultural or language barriers, and established provider trust.

In this way, Project ECHO can provide a unique advantage over telemedicine by improving community access to essential healthcare services. Furthermore, research shows that primary care providers who participate in tele-mentoring programs report a higher overall satisfaction. In fact, current participants in our BHI ECHO program report an increase in their overall job satisfaction from 4.11 to 4.26, an increased ability to work at the top of their scope of practice from 3.89 to 4.26, and in their ability to meet their patients needs from 4.15 to 4.42, on a 5-point Likert scale.Since ASU is not an academic medical center, we collaborate with community partners extensively to provide the expertise for our programming.

As a shared responsibility to democratize medical knowledge and disseminate best-practices across the healthcare workforce, the ECHO community at large is committed to providing all programming free of charge. In addition, we provide free CME/CEU credits whenever possible. As such, there is not now, nor ever projected to be a sustainable financial model built within Project ECHO itself. With that said, many ECHO programs, including the BHI ECHO program, operate over the course of years with no anticipated end dates, simply because there is a need. As the founder of Project ECHO states, ECHO is a project of the willing. Since ASU began offering ECHO programming in 2020, we have operationalized our programs through a combination of external funding received from national level organizations to state-run insurance providers to support from family foundations in combination with internal support from ASU leadership. As we would move forward beyond the life of this grant, we will continue to partner with organizations who share our same collective mindset to make continuing professional development accessible, affordable, and in alignment with the needs of our communities.Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant8Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American UniversityThe BHI ECHO program has four program objectives: Success Measures and ReportingProposed Goals* Describe the expected outcomes using SMART  specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-oriented  goals. Be sure to detail how outcomes will be measured and reported using both quantitative and qualitative measures.1. Enhance knowledge SMART GOAL: after one-year, 90% of participants will be knowledgeable or very knowledgeable in describing best practices for diagnosing patients with mental health conditions.2.Increase Confidence SMART GOAL: after one-year, 80% of participants will be confident or very confident in treating patients with mental health conditions in the primary care setting, including those from vulnerable populations.3. Change Practice Behaviors SMART GOAL: after one-year, 70% of participating providers will increase the mental health services available within their practicesIncrease Capacity4. SMART GOAL: after one-year, 80% of participating providers will demonstrate an increased capacity to treat patients with mental health conditions by increasing the number of mental health patients treated within their local practice.These program outcomes will be analyzed in accordance with ASU Project ECHOs Monitoring and Evaluation plan. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected through the administration of two surveys. First, a post-session survey will be disseminated after each individual teleECHO session and will collect data on overall session satisfaction, knowledge, confidence, practice behavior change, as well as data pertaining to CME accreditation standards (i.e. material was presented free of commercial bias, etc.). The second survey will be a retroactive-pre-post survey administered at the 6- and 12- month intervals of program operations. This survey will collect more in depth data relating to self-reported changes in knowledge, confidence, practice behaviors, and overall clinician wellness measures comparing before and after participation in the ECHO program. Both surveys will collect qualitative data that will include perceived benefits of the program/session. Lastly, participant demographics will also be collected through both surveys as well as through the program registration process.The outputs measured through this program will include:  Number of session held Number of didactics presented, number of cases presented Number of individual participants and clinical sites attending Number of Arizona counties represented among participating providers Number of participants attending from Medically Underserved Areas in Arizona Participant demographics (name, credentials, practice setting, location, contact information) Clinic demographics (organization name, location, practice type) Number of learning hours delivered Number to CME/CEU credits dispersedProposed Outputs* Detail the metrics that will be tracked as part of the progress towards the outcomes.Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant9Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American University Participant satisfaction rates CME accreditation specific measures (i.e. information presented free of commercial bias, opportunity provided to ask questions, etc.) Relevance of material discussed to participants medical practices Average number of patients with diagnosed mental health condition being treated within their practice Average number of patients with diagnosed mental health condition being referred outside of their practice Integration of team-based care in the primary care setting Self-reported changes in:Various measures of clinical knowledgeVarious measures of clinical confidenceIntegration of content learned into their medical practiceo Overall job satisfactionValue of clinical practiceo Ability to meet patients needsProvider burnout Program fidelity (how well the BHI ECHO program adheres to the standards set forth by the ECHO Institute).oooooDemonstrated Outcomes To Date Include evidence of existing data and outcomes that support the efficacy and/or impact of the proposed activities (if applicable).Since February 2020, our team has developed 10 healthcare-based ECHO programs, collectively delivering 359 live, teleECHO sessions to 2,251 unique participants, totaling 12,190 learning hours of free CME. This breaks out to an average of one teleECHO session hosted every 3 days. Furthermore, to support these operations, we have been awarded over $2.1 million in external funding in our first 3 years of operation. Average attendance per session across all programming is 40.4 with an average reported satisfaction rate of 4.68 (5-point Likert scale, 5=extremely satisfied; n=2,923). The most common known professional backgrounds of participants attending ASU Project ECHO programs (n=684) are nurses (BSN, RN, etc.) making up 35% of all participants. Physicians (MD, DO), advanced practice providers (PA, NP), and behavioral health providers (PsyD, LMSW, etc.) are the next most common at 21%, 19%, and 18% respectively. Participant attendances were logged from 45 US states, the District of Columbia, and five countries (n=11,220) including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, and Egypt. Since its initial launch in April 2020, the BHI ECHO has never ceased operation and continues to meet biweekly. To date, we have delivered a total of 64 teleECHO sessions to 802 individual learners for a total of 3,175 learning hours of free continuing medical education. Participants in the current BHI ECHO program reported increases in all measures of knowledge and confidence assessed. Specifically participants report a mean increase from 3.17 to 3.96 on their knowledge about expanding integrated team-based care capacity to integrate best-practices into their clinics (5-point Likert scale). Furthermore, participants also reported mean increases in their confidence to provide care to patients with complex behavioral health needs from 3.40 to 4.07 and to manage integrated healthcare teams from 3.20 to 4.00 (5-point Likert scale).Organizational Infrastructure* Describe the organizational infrastructure and roles of staff members currently in place to support the proposed grant activities.Printed On: 1 March 2023Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona Foundation Mental Health Grant10Virginia DeSantoArizona State University Foundation for A New American Universityo*Note: If staff needs to be hired to implement the proposed activities, please provide a hiring timeline and onboarding process.Specific personnel that will develop and deliver the BHI ECHO program include: o Adrienne Madhavpeddi, MS oversee development and delivery including monitoring and evaluation, grant management, program operations, staffing, and program fidelity.Elizabeth Williams, MPH manage relationships with community partners, address administrative requests, oversee accreditation efforts for CME/CEU, and oversee survey administration, data analysis, drafting of reports, dissemination of findings, etc.o Maria Hanlin, MA responsible for daily operations including management of program registrations, communications with participants, scheduling, adhering to CME accreditation requirements, attendance, iECHO database management, marketing, and aligning patient case presentations.Lesley Manson, Psy.D. is a Clinical Associate Professor at ASUs College of Health Solutions and is a licensed clinical psychologist with two decades of clinical experience.Cathy Hudgins, Psy.D. is an expert in clinical behavioral health integration.

FP00036644,908,,,,,1,,,"Abstract Our study leverages collaboration between experts on immunoproteomics and biomarker discovery and Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the USA. Immune checkpoint therapy (ICI) is revolutionizing the therapy of a number of malignancies, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Therapeutic blockade of immune checkpoints, such as by anti-PD-1, removes the tumor-initiated suppression of the immune system and unleashes prolonged anti-tumor immunity. Despite the encouraging success, many patients develop severe and sometimes life-threating adverse effects, or many also fail to benefit from immunotherapy. Existing immune therapy response predictive markers have only modest positive predictive values and there are no clinically useful markers of toxicity. Our proposed study will focus on comprehensive evaluation of serological auto-antibodies (AAb) as potential predictors of immune related adverse event (irAE) and benefit from therapy. Serum based biomarkers exploit easy sample accessibility and directly measure immune responses.  Our platform can be rapidly adopted for clinical use.  physician scientists specializing in breast cancer. Our study will analyze more than 3000 longitudinal serum samples collected from 1,195 patients enrolled in a randomized phase III trial (SWOG S1418) that tests the efficacy of one year of single agent adjuvant pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) therapy compared to observation in high risk TNBC. Serum samples were collected at baseline and at 13 and 55 weeks after starting therapy, all samples are annotated with detailed toxicity and outcome information that were collected during this FDA registration trial. We will employ two complementary high-throughput antibody profiling technologies including Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA) and Multiple In Solution Antibody Assay (MISPA) that we developed. NAPPA allows the detection of antibodies against tens of thousands freshly produced full length proteins in hundreds of samples while MISPA enables more precise quantification of hundreds of antibodies in thousands of samples and could be scaled for clinical use. Our approach involves (i) a discovery step using the NAPPA arrays that will interrogate serum samples for AAbs against 18,000 human proteins in the discovery cohort, (ii) a verification step of identified outcome-predictive AAb using the MISPA platform using the discovery samples to select the final set of candidate markers, (iii) and blinded validation of candidate AAb using MISPA on the held out validation set. Identification of biomarkers that can predict clinically-relevant immune-related adverse events or recurrence, and hence inefficacy of therapy, would help better estimate the risk benefit ratio of these very expensive and potentially toxic therapies. Predictors of adverse events could also influence patient monitoring and allow earlier therapeutic intervention. The lessons learned from this proposed study on TNBC will likely impact a broad spectrum of other cancers since adverse events are not cancer type dependent.     ",
FP00036672,909,,,,,1,,,"Ambulatory care-sensitive hospitalizations (ACSH), an indication of sub-optimal healthcare access and quality, accounted for about $34 billion in hospital costs for U.S. adult residents (=18 years) in 2017-the most recent year for which there are national estimates. Cardiovascular and chronic lung diseases are the leading causes of chronic ACSH. ACSH is more prevalent among Medicaid-insured, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic people compared to commercially-insured or non-Hispanic White people. There is a gap in the literature about ACSH among Native Americans. There is also a knowledge gap regarding the relationship between ACSH and intersectional status (the interconnectedness of social determinants of health such as race/ethnicity, age, and sex). It is also not clear whether population-level factors modify the relationship between intersectional status and ACSH. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted endemic health disparities and the importance of addressing these disparities. The rapid implementation of telemedicine due to the COVID-19 pandemic could be leveraged to address sub-optimal healthcare use among Medicaid-insured individuals with previous chronic ACSH. However, sub-optimal telemedicine use among non-White, older, and low-income individuals could limit the implementation and impact of such interventions. It is also crucial to identify the relationship between telemedicine use, and subsequent hospitalizations and the impact of intersectional status and population-level factors on this relationship. Filling these knowledge gaps will guide targeted interventions. This study aims to knowledge gaps using the following three aims: Aim 1, we will estimate the interplay between intersectional identities (race/ethnicity, gender, and age) and population-level factors in reducing ACSH among Medicaid-insured Arizonans. Aim 2, we will estimate the interplay between intersectional identities and population-level factors on telemedicine use among those with a pre-pandemic chronic ACSH. For aim 3, we will analyze the impact of telemedicine use on subsequent hospitalization among those who had an outpatient visit during the pandemic and estimate how intersectional status and population-level factors modify this relationship. We will address these aims using 2018-2023 Arizona State Medicaid claims data merged with five population datasets. The Arizona Medicaid dataset is an ideal source because it is a claims-level dataset with a one-month lag, which will increase our ability to determine both historic and recent healthcare utilization related to ACSH. This study will provide critical insights that will guide a tailored intervention that will leverage telemedicine to increase ambulatory care visits among Medicaid-insured Arizonans with a previous chronic ACSH while assessing the impact of the intervention on subsequent healthcare use and clinical outcomes. The study will also provide insights that will guide population-level strategies to reduce ACSH and increase telemedicine use among Medicaid-insured Arizonans living with chronic diseases.",
FP00036761,910,,,,,1,,,"Proposal Intents and Justifications: Oxidative damage/redox imbalance is a critical driver of teratogenesis. The exploratory studies in this proposal have 2 basic intents, (1). Fill knowledge gaps in our understandings of redox homeostasis systems in the placenta. (2). Utilize this knowledge to develop new interventions that will specifically target placental trophoblasts to optimize placental support of the fetus. They will build on our prior studies illustrating that redox shifts accelerate the requisite/baseline apoptotic fetal neuron death while concomitantly perturbing glutathione (GSH)-mediated redox control systems in the placenta. In this oxidative stress (OS) setting, the underlying mechanism is impaired GSH synthesis due to reduced cellular cysteine (Cys) availability, the control point for GSH synthesis. We have mechanistically linked three transcriptionally controlled systems vital to cellular redox homeostasis to this imbalance and impaired cellular Cys. They are compromised inward transport of cystine (CySS) as well as impaired cellular Cys synthesis by the Transsulfuration pathway (TSP). Importantly, in fetal neurons and in neuroprogenitor cells, the perturbed cellular redox potential and cellular damage can be reversed, wholly or in part, by increasing expression and activity of the CySS transporter, upregulation of Ntf2, and by transcriptional and pharmacological manipulations of the TSP.     The Hypothesis that drives this proposal is: Placental trophoblast Nrf2-dependent GSH homeostasis systems are highly dependent on CySS supplied by the transporter, Xc- as well as internally generated Cys by the TSP. These control points are compelling targets for interventions that can normalize placental redox homeostasis and enable it to optimally supply the fetus with Cys/CySS. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mechanisms underlying redox damage to trophoblasts are inhibition of the CySS transport system Xc- (SLC7A11), reduced synthesis of Cys by the transsulfuration pathway (TSP), and Nrf2 dysregulation. Experiments will elucidate placental mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the TSP and Xc-, consequences of dysfunction, its role in maintenance of trophoblast GSH homeostasis, and compensatory crosstalk between TSP and the CySS transporter.Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that placental redox damage can be prevented by a rescue strategy using specific biodegradable nanoparticle targeting of trophoblasts to up-regulate the above placental GSH homeostasis components. This will enable the placenta to supply the fetal compartment with the Cys needed to block OS-related damage to the fetal brain while avoiding off-target damage to vital fetal brain signaling pathways mediated by low levels of reactive oxygen species.",
FP00036840,911,,,,,1,,,"Exertional heat illness (EHI) risk in high school (HS) athletes will continue rising as climate change progresses, more so in non-white than white communities. Though policies based on heat-safety guidelines to mitigate risk of EHI are effective, there is poor adoption of guidelines across states. Racial equity of such interventions is unlcear. It is unknown how severely EHI risk or racial disparities in HS athletes will be impacted by rising temperatures. There is an urgent need to correct this gap because failure to do so will prevent the enaction of policies that equitably reduce risk of EHI as heat continues to intensify. The aims of this proposal are to compare the predicted trajectory of EHI risk in HS athletes by community racial composition and to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of heat-safety guidelines by degree of compliance. These will be achieved using data approach comprised of climate projections for 2030, 2050, and 2100, predictive modeling, and epidemiological data  an innovative approach that has successfully modeled other public health threats.

Subjects will be scheduled to complete two experimental visits within three weeks of one another. Each experimental visit will examine one of two  beverages  on  hydration  and  related  perceptual  variable efficacy: 1) Capri Sun Roarin Waters, and 2) plain water.  Day Before study: The subject will consume a standardized frozen dinner (provided by the researchers) and consume at least 250 ml (8oz) of water after dinner. Study Day: Subjects will arrive at each study visit fasted (no food or beverages within the previous eight hours, except 200 ml of plain water two to three hours prior to the experimental visit). Upon arrival, subjects will then consume a standardized breakfast. Following breakfast,  subjects will provide a urine sample, we will record body weight and measure body fluids by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS), and they will complete questionnaires about mouth dryness, taste pleasantness, stomach fullness, and thirst).          After  this  subject  will  enter  a  warm  room  with  a  temperature between 28-30C (80-85F). Then subjects will undergo a 3-hour walk, cycle, and rest protocol. The exercise intensity is based on 70% of the subjects predicted heart rate using the formula: 220 beats per minute (bpm)  10 years of age = 210 bpm, and 70% equals 147 bpm). This is an intensity in which the subject has an elevated breathing frequency but is still able to talk.

FP00036868,913,,,,,1,,,"Project ECHO provides free, research-based, synchronous, high-quality, online professional development training to early care providers serving children ages 0-5. Each training series includes eight, 1.5 hour training sessions (over 16 weeks). The following eight training topics are designed to increase providers ability to build childrens oral language and early literacy skills as a foundation for future reading decoding and reading comprehension: language and print rich classrooms/centers, oral language (conversations), oral language (problem solving), alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, dialogic reading, literacy-based dramatic play, early writing, and early spelling.Participants engage in five different types of learning and practice activities as part of each Project ECHO training session. The order of these activities may vary.1. Listen to successes and challenges encountered by participants as they completed their homework from the prior session.2. Listen to a brief didactic training and modelling session (15 minutes) in the training topic presented by an expert in the field. Participants and other hub team members ask questions of the didactic presenter. The presenter also previews resource materials available to participants through a Canvas course shell.3. After the didactic session, participants receive their homework assignment (directly related to modelling in the didactic session) to complete over the next two weeks. For example, the homework might be to try out two different phonological awareness activities with their children. Participants are divided into small groups to help each other make a plan for their homework completion.   4. During the final whole group wrap up, key points from the session are reviewed. Participants complete a survey rating the quality and usefulness of the training session. Participants earn CEUs for completion of these activities. Participants access the program by responding to a QR code or link on our informational flyers or by following a link on our web site. We use our existing network of agencies, educational and professional organizations, the state of Arizona workforce registry, and database of prior ECHO participants to disseminate information about the upcoming Project ECHO training series throughout Maricopa County. The training series are directly aligned to building and strengthening the literacy capacity of practitioners in early learning environments. Free training increases access to training, increasing children and families access to higher quality early care programs. We conduct a program evaluation for each series by asking participants to complete pre- and post-training assessments of their knowledge and implementation practices for taught topics. Participants also complete evaluations of each training session and the overall program. We connect participants to additional resources on our ASU hosted canvas shell for Project ECHO trainings.",

It has a devastating impact on the patient, family members and society at large. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often an early stage of AD and a potentially promising time in which to intervene. A very promising dietary strategy, based on rodent models, is time-restricted eating, which may impact cognitive function favorably through metabolic and neuronal mechanisms. Little is known about the effects of time-restricted eating on cognitive performance in humans. The majority of studies of time-restricted eating focused on cardiometabolic outcomes or were conducted in rodent models. The overarching aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of time-restricted eating on cognitive performance in human adults with MCI.",

However, no standard protocol for managing paper-based SOPARC or SOPLAY data in a manner conducive to producing desired outputs (i.e., light-PA, MVPA) currently exists. Our team of researchers, who are experienced in using SOPARC and SOPLAY (XX combined years across tools), developed data management tools to facilitate data management and initial analyses. Hence, the purpose of this work is to provide two web-based, publicly available tools for managing data collected using SOPARC and SOPLAY. The tools are poised to make a significant impact on the ease and ability of researchers to manage their data, as they will allow for a universal strategy for researchers to manage data collected from SOPARC and SOPLAY. Having an accessible, shared system to manage data will maintain consistency in how data are summarized and increase the ability and confidence of the findings when comparing across studies.

FP00036897,917,,,,,1,,,"There are 5.4 million adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the U.S. and the lifetime public costs of a person with ASD is ~$3.6 million. Most autistic adults are un- or under-employed and do not live independently, with executive function challenges being a major underlying reason. Unfortunately, there are no executive function interventions for autism beyond teenage years. Like most aspects of ASD, executive abilities are highly heterogenous, which is a challenge for intervention development. Thus, there is a critical need to develop precision executive function interventions for autistic adults. A promising cutting-edge avenue for cognitive interventions is neuromodulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). TDCS has advantages over other clinical neuromodulation techniques because it is safe, well-tolerated, relatively inexpensive, and easily portable. Rigor of prior tDCS research has improved over the years, but tDCS is not yet optimized, in part due to inter-subject variability. Our team advanced Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography (MREIT) to map in vivo current flow. With this advance, precise electrode placement and current intensity adjustments could be made on an individual basis. Furthermore, MREIT-derived conductivity distributions reflect electrolyte and membrane structural distributions that are related to disease. These may prove to be novel biomarkers for ASD and related clinical symptoms such as executive dysfunction. Our long-term goal is to develop precision biomarkers and interventions for autistic adults. In line with NIHs experimental medicine approach to clinical trials and specific guidelines for tDCS, the aims of this study are to: 1) validate MREIT in adults with ASD against gold-standard computational models, 2) demonstrate target engagement via MREIT, as compared to functional MRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, and 3) explore MREIT metrics as biomarkers for ASD and executive dysfunction. For our study design, we will recruit 35 adults with ASD and 35 neurotypical (NT) adults matched on demographics, from our database of ~400 previous ASD and NT brain imaging participants. We will conduct intra-MRI tDCS to collect MREIT current density, electric field, and conductivity maps and fMRI data during a working memory n-back task (BOLD). Participants will also complete the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Having accomplished these aims, we will make a sustained impact by: 1) advancing fundamental knowledge of in vivo electrical brain properties in ASD, 2) identifying novel biomarkers for clinical ASD symptoms, and 3) laying the groundwork for a future, precision executive function tDCS efficacy trial in autistic adults. The next steps for this project will be to develop precision tDCS protocols based on individualized computational models derived from empirical MREIT data. This framework for MREIT-guided precision tDCS is health related because it can be used to address cognitive and other ASD symptoms (e.g. repetitive behaviors, motor) and other clinical conditions including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimers disease.",
FP00036905,918,,,,,1,,,"The Southwest United States (US) is home to some of the most traditional and culturally preserved American Indian (AI) urban and periurban communities in the US. Elders are vital members of AI society, and elder traditions and values form a cornerstone for the community. Research that identifies factors associated with healthy aging among AI elders will honor and validate elder contributions to AI society and inform next generations.AI elders age with accumulating morbidities concurrent with strong social support and networks. Unpublished data from our pilot Tucson Indian Center Heart Mind Study (TIC HMS) conducted among urban and periurban AI elders (median age 62 years) in 2017-2018, showed that central and total obesity were prevalent among 85-90% and hypertension among 60-70%. However, average global cognition was good and cognitive impairment (defined as >1 SD below the sample mean) was observed only among 13%; 23-32% experienced clinically relevant depressive or anxiety symptoms. Satisfaction with the support received from friends was reported among 94%. As AI elders age, it is imperative to understand the interplay among resilience and vulnerability factors in association with brain and physical health so that elders can adequately prepare for future health and care. Successful completion of our past AI elder pilot studies using the Community Survey in Dementia (CSID), and letters of support from our Tribal and Urban Indian organization collaborators evidence our success.The Healthy Aging Among Tribal Elders in Urban & Periurban Southwest U.S. Communities study based in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, US (two of the top 10 urban areas with the largest AI populations), will include multifaceted aspects of aging. We propose to enroll 400 elder (age >55 years) men and women over 10 months, with one longitudinal follow-up 12 months later and accomplish the following:Aim 1. Assess aging phenotypes and exposures using the comprehensive CSID. We will measure:Aim 1.a. cognition, mental health, resilience, mastery and loneliness.Aim 1.b. social support, networks and activities.Aim 1.c. instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), history of falls, polypharmacy, and tobacco and alcohol use.Aim.1.d. socioecological determinants of health including educational attainment, employment, access to health care, housing, transportation, and internet access.The CSID will be supplemented with questions regarding the sandwich generation, social changes during and after COVID-19, and elder abuse.Aim 2. Assess physical health among 400 women and men using clinically measurements. We will evaluate:Aim 2.a. physical performance, including 4m walk, hand grip strength, and chair standsAim 2.b. cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk including overweight and obesity, hypertension, HbA1c, and hyperlipidemias, and calculate Framingham and the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Scores, and the ABCs of T2D (A1c, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, smoking).Aim 3. Host talking circles among a subset (N=xx) of elder cohort participants that will allow us to tease out culturally appropriate implementation science approaches to improve cohort study design over time and inform future community-based interventions.Our mixed methods approach provides rigor for today and the future and promotes community engagement. In the process, we will train two AI early-stage investigators (ESI) in planning and implementing the protocol (research study design, methods, implementation and analysis) and disseminating results as we rigorously adhere to study protocols, provide ongoing staff training and support, and ensure data confidentiality.The alignment of strong, multidisciplinary investigators in key areas of scientific importance in resilient AI aging, and the mPIs depth and breadth of experience, uniquely positions our study to support national efforts in understanding healthy aging in urban and periurban elders. Our goal is that data gathered from this larger AI elder intervention cohort will inform future interventions to promote active aging, prevent later-life Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), and improve the health status and quality of life among Southwest AI elders.",
FP00036909,919,,,,,1,,,"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by increased amyloid -protein and tau aggregation in medial temporal lobe regions of the brain that begin before cognitive symptoms. Developing sensitive and readily accessible brain markers to detect AD-related pathophysiology and track decline is critical. Motor-task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may provide evidence to better understand the stages at which synaptic dysfunction and inflammation contribute to various clinical features of cognitive impairment. People with elevated risk of cognitive impairment, increased gait variability, and loss of dominant hand grip strength (e.g., motoric cognitive risk syndrome) experience changes in sensorimotor and medial temporal network connectivity. Understanding these changes will provide integral knowledge about the nature of early changes and facilitate early intervention for AD. This study aims to investigate the impact of altered brain activity during grip motor tasks as an indication of neurodegeneration, associated with plasma-based biomarkers (e.g., neurofilament light chain, NFL), used in conjunction with advanced diffusion magnetic resonance (dMRI) imaging to track progression over time and predict amyloid positive status. The clinical observation of decreased gait speed, grip strength, and subjective memory complaints provide clues to the stages, progression, and variants of AD identified with motor task fMRI. We hypothesize that decreased motor reserve may result in faster short-term progression rates in preclinical AD. To test this hypothesis, we have established three aims: 1) establish task fMRI-based markers of neurodegeneration and motor reserve for preclinical AD, 2) predict rates of cognitive decline and assess the utility of task fMRI-based markers for staging and monitoring disease progression in preclinical AD, and 3) characterize moderators and mediators that impact motor reserve in preclinical AD.  Our expected outcome is to lay the groundwork for a distinct motor phenotype for preclinical AD, identify targets for secondary prevention trials in AD, and utilize brain-based biomarkers for intervention targets and increase targeted candidate selection for clinical trials. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to alter the current concepts and methodologies of early diagnosis and time course of preclinical AD. This, in turn, will support the development of multimodal brain measures as accessible and cost-effective diagnostic and progression markers for use in screening, diagnosis, and clinical trials of AD therapies.",
FP00036919,920,,,,,1,,,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) face a life-long struggle with verbal communication, not only regarding forming speech sounds clearly (Stoel-Gammon, 2001) but also understanding what others say and expressing their thoughts in words and sentences. (Abbeduto et al., 2003; Kristensen et al., 2022; Sokol & Fey, 2013). Areas of relative strength are social interaction skills including use of gestures and good word comprehension, while word and sentence production and comprehension progress at a slower pace, compared to typical peers (Chapman, 2006). First words appear around age 21 months, compared to around 12 months in typical peers (Stoel-Gammon, 2001). Accuracy of speech sound production is problematic, as is the process of motor planning that underlies speech sound production, which makes it difficult to understand the speech of individuals with DS (Buckley & Bird, 2001). Young children with DS tend to produce sparse output, which diminishes opportunities for caregiver responses and adds a suboptimal linguistic environment to the challenges of learning to talk (Parikh & Mastergeorge, 2018). The earliest speech-language pathology services for children with DS address feeding and oral motor issues; speech and language therapy typically starts when children start using words, which can occur as late as age 4 years in children with DS/  Although these challenges are predictable at birth, there are no prevention-based interventions addressing speech and language for infants with DS (Finestack, Elmquist, et al., 2022). While generally, evidence supports the use of caregiver-implemented interventions for young children (Roberts et al., 2014), there have been no comprehensive clinical trials for young children with DS that evaluate the effects of proactive caregiver-led interventions. The proposed pilot study will address this critical gap by examining the feasibility and benefits of a proactive caregiver-implemented speech and language intervention for infants with DS that is initiated prior to age 6 months, based on the Babble Boot Camp (BBC) model. Our team developed BBC as the first intense, longitudinal, personalized, proactive intervention designed to prevent or minimize speech and language impairments in children whose risk is predictable at birth. BBC is a bundle of routines and activities for infants as young as birth. Starting with earliest signals of communication, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) helps caregivers to enrich their interactions with their child, stimulate early vocalizations (coo, babble), support the emergence of first words, and foster vocabulary and syntax growth. Via weekly 20-minute telehealth sessions, the SLP coaches parents as they implement the activities and routines at home, tailored individually to each childs present skillset. BBC is currently concluding an NIH-funded clinical trial (5 R01HD098253-4) for children with classic galactosemia (CG), a genetic inborn error of metabolism diagnosed with newborn screening. Children with CG have a 60%-80% risk of developing severe speech and language disorders. Because CG is detected at birth, this risk is predictable long before children show evidence of speech and language difficulties. Results show that children with CG who received the BBC intervention had improved babble and word complexity and expressive vocabularies, compared to children with CG who received standard care. At annual follow-up speech and language assessments, effect sizes were up to >2 when compared to children with CG receiving standard care (Peter et al., 2021; Beate Peter et al., 2022; Peter, Potter, et al., 2019) (also see Preliminary Results). The BBC telehealth delivery model is highly time- and cost-effective, and parents rated their experience as beneficial and feasible (Finestack, Potter, et al., 2022). Although children with CG and DS have distinctly different profiles of developmental strengths and needs, we predict that BBC will similarly support the speech and language development of children with DS due to its intense focus on parent coaching, parent responsivity to the child, the personalized approach, and the enriched linguistic environment. In what follows, we outline why BBC holds great promise for infants with DS:Typically, children learn to talk without explicit instruction, simply by being exposed to language in their environment. During babble, they develop an inventory of consonants and vowels, which then become the building blocks for producing their first words that they pick up from the language spoken to and around them (Stoel-Gammon, 1983). Their speech sound inventory develops from there in characteristic patterns, e.g., sounds made in the front of the mouth are mastered before those made in the back of the mouth, and sounds requiring little effort in air flow control, e.g, /m, n/ are mastered before more aerodynamically complex sounds, e.g., ch in choo-choo (McLeod & Crowe, 2018; Peter, Vose, et al., 2019). There is evidence that strong babble skills in the first year of life support and predict strong speech skills later on (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2007; DePaolis et al., 2013; McCune & Vihman, 2001; Oller et al., 1998; Oller et al., 1999; Stoel-Gammon, 1989, 2011; Vihman & Greenlee, 1987; Vihman et al., 1985). Children with DS have sparse and simple babble patterns, with slower growth in consonant and vowels compared to typical peers. By actively supporting their babble skills, we expect to give them the motor skills and auditory motor-sound associations for use as building blocks for speech production in words.For typical children, language skills grow as they are exposed to language used around them and extract the linguistic regularities. They infer the sequences of speech sounds, the meanings of words and parts of words, and the ways words can be combined into larger units of meanings, simply via repeated exposure to language in situational contexts. Children with intellectual disability, which is present to variable degrees in both CG and DS, have difficulty extracting linguistic regularities from exposure to language. They require not only increased rates of responses to their utterances but also linguistic input characterized by higher quantity and systematically tailored quality (Kover, 2018), all of which the BBC intervention is designed to provide. Children with DS tend to initiate fewer vocalizations than typical children, which leaves parents with fewer opportunities to respond (Parikh & Mastergeorge, 2018). However, when mothers responded to their 4-months-old infants with DS by imitating the infants vocalization, an increase in child vocalizations was noted (Fiani et al., 2021). The BBC intervention coaches parents in quantity and quality of responses to their children throughout the intervention. We expect not only increased vocalization rates in the children at young ages but also increased and more complex infant vocalizations at the babble stage and beyond.Lastly, given the successes of the BBC intervention in children with CG, we hypothesize that the very early start age of the intervention leverages the high level of neural plasticity at this age, and that by addressing speech and language proactively, we are avoiding the childrens need to unlearn faulty articulatory, phonological, semantic, and syntactic patterns. This is relevant, as many children with DS receiving standard care have faulty phonological representations because their faulty patterns go uncorrected (Dodd & Thompson, 2001). Importantly, one key design feature of BBC is the zone of proximal development, an approach to intervention that engages children at the level of mastery, then nudging them toward the next level of complexity that they can master with initial support. This component is central, and it epitomizes the personalized and proactive nature of the BBC intervention.",

In a radically newparadigm, we propose to develop a computational framework that uses historical data for exploring newand alternative treatments. This new program will focus on building vertically integrated components thatenable us to explore new and alternative treatments based on historical longitudinal data in a partnershipbetween PI and a a behavioral scientist with substantial experience in clinical trials, behavioral health, andwearable technology.Intellectual MeritThis project will create a treatment discovery framework for identifying optimal behavioral treatments by developingalgorithms and tools for counterfactual reasoning and simulation-based optimization. Intellectuallyrigorous aspects of the project are: Counterfactual reasoning: we will research methods of designing novel counterfactual reasoning algorithmsthat use longitudinal wearable sensor data and behavioral health outcomes to assess the impactof alternative treatments on an individual based on observed treatment on a different individual. Simulation-based reasoning: we will design innovative simulation-based reasoning techniques that usepetrinets and answer set programming to simulate behavioral interventions using longigudinal wearablesensor data. Evaluation: we will assess the performance of the reasoning algorithms and treatment discovery techniquesusing our historical data as well as publicly available data focused on biomarkers including physicalactivity, diet, and stress involving health participants, people with or at risk for chronic conditions.Broader ImpactsThis research will not only address the technical challenges in building systems for accurate health monitoringand adaptive treatment, but will also enable actual management of many health conditions.

FP00036970,923,,,,,1,,,"Exposure to violence is associated with health: A variety of studies employing multiple populations across multiple time periods show that physical and mental health (as well as an abundance of other outcomes including educational attainment, cognitive development, and antisocial behavior) have been shown to be related to exposure to violence (see Sharkey 2018 for a review). As has been documented for nearly a quarter-century, this exposure can be direct (e.g. experiencing victimization) and indirect (e.g. knowing someone who has experienced victimization) (Buka et al. 2001), resulting in negative outcomes in both circumstances. While the consequences of direct and indirect exposure to violence are well-documented, more recent work (e.g. Sharkey 2018) has sought to understand the consequences of living in violent environments (i.e. settings with high levels of violence) and being adjacent to violence situations (i.e. locations and times where violence is more likely). These studies broaden the scope of risk factors that influence individual health by including typical measures of crime, but also additional measures of violence such as exposure to police violence (e.g. Jindal et al. 2021). Further, there has been a proliferation of indices capturing the adverse conditions in local areas that not only affect health but affect access to the very health services that might be used to help mitigate the effects of stress and crime on health outcomes. These include the Center for Disease Control and Prevention / Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (CDC/ATSDR)s Social Vulnerability Index, which uses more than a dozen regional variables from the U.S. census to identify communities that may need additional supports during health crises and HRSAs Area Deprivation Index, which has been refined by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. However, because of the reliance on the census or other large national data sources, there are significant lags in these indices that mean that changes in area characteristics will only be captured with a significant lag (3 years currently for both the SVI and the ADI, currently available only for 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example).Data sources: This project would link regional data sets from the City of Phoenix, updated on daily to monthly intervals, to measures derived from data from the Arizona Medicaid program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), which the Center for Health information and Research (CHiR at ASU) receives monthly.",

However, although there are many methods and databases for annotating genomes, reconstructing phylogenies, identifying orthologous sets of genes across species, and organizing and exploiting phenotypic ontologies across species for comparative analyses, there are relatively few methods designed for exploring genome-phenome relationships simultaneously between and within non-microbial species that take a broad and more systematic approach than, e.g., testing each gene or functional element in isolation. This proposal describes the development, application, and deployment of analytical methods designed to test associations between individual or sets of genomic factors and phenotypes among different species.",
FP00037159,927,,,,,1,,,"Proposal To: Parkinson's Foundation Program: Community Grants (2022 and Later) Title (Applicant): ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic: SPEAK OUT! and LOUD Crowd (Trueba, Elizabeth) Deadline: 1/31/2023 11:59:59 PM (U.S. Eastern Time)  Program Descriptions  Please provide a program description. The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic offers an evidence-based speech therapy program created by the Parkinson Voice Project (PVP). This is a two-part program that consists of SPEAK OUT!, individual therapy services, and the LOUD Crowd, group therapy services. The program emphasizes speaking louder and with intent, techniques that help adults with Parkinson's disease be more easily understood while also improving their physical health. Often a weak voice can lead to serious speech and swallowing difficulties. The PVP stresses living with intent, which is something the clinic is also passionate about. Therapy is not only about speaking with intent, but also about living mindfully, being deliberate, and putting forth conscious effort in one's actions.  After an initial speech evaluation, participants engage in 6 weeks of individual therapy. Therapy sessions are scheduled 2 times per week and participants are offered a choice of in-person or telehealth services. Individuals are provided with a workbook by the PVP and are tasked to complete exercises in between sessions. We seek to include their caregivers in this process. Additionally, the PVP offers live exercise sessions and recordings online to support motivation and participation. Each therapy session follows a planned protocol, however, clinicians individualize the content. For example, if a participant is passionate about gardening, the clinicians select reading passages related to a local arboretum and cognitive exercises focused on the organization and recall of plants. Once the participant has met their goals and completed the SPEAK OUT! program, they transition to the LOUD Crowd group. This group aims to promote maintenance, provide accountability, and offer support and encouragement from peers. Participants are encouraged to attend the LOUD Crowd for as long as they wish. This continued contact also allows clinicians to monitor progress and offer SPEAK OUT! refresher sessions as needed, understanding the progressive and degenerative nature of the disease. All sessions include an element of education with the intention of empowering participants and their loved ones. The more knowledge they have, the more prepared they are to ask educated questions and advocate for themselves.  It is important to note that these services are provided by graduate student clinicians enrolled in the Master of Science Communication Disorders program under the supervision of a licensed and certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). There are currently 5 SLPs trained in the PVP program. The College of Health Solutions has a mission to prepare tomorrow's leaders to address the challenges facing people and communities to stay healthy, improve their health, and manage chronic disease. This program fully supports this charge. In addition to providing necessary services to individuals with Parkinson's disease, it also presents a rich learning opportunity for speech-language pathologists in training.  Please provide evidence for the need of your program in your local Parkinson's community (information should pertain to the program type but also need in your specific community): According to the Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES) State Plan on Aging (2019-2022), Arizona is home to 1.5 million older citizens, or approximately 22% of the total population. Previous census data (2016) ranked Arizona as #2 in the nation for relocating retirees. The highest migration is to the cities of Mesa, Phoenix, Chandler, and Scottsdale, which are all within the same metropolitan area as Arizona State University in Tempe. The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic initiated this program in Fall 2019. Since then, 33 individuals with Parkinson's disease have been served, with 10 of these participants retained as members of the LOUD Crowd. There are typically between 5-10 individuals on the waitlist for services. The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic is well-established and receives consistent referrals from healthcare providers in the community. The clinic is engaged in community outreach for people with Parkinson's disease. This includes the Parkinson's Foundation Phoenix Moving Day and Parkinson's Revolution events, which are well-attended by members of the local Parkinson's community.  The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic has a relationship with Mirabella at ASU, a senior living facility focused on lifelong learning. As a part of their continuing education series, a member of the clinical faculty presented a lecture about speech deficits related to Parkinson's disease to approximately 40 people in their community. This resulted in referrals to the clinic for both speech and hearing services.   With telehealth established as a method of service delivery, access to individuals with Parkinson's disease who are not geographically or logistically close to an outpatient therapy clinic has increased. The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic is connected to a Parkinson's support group in Southern Arizona (Green Valley) and has provided telehealth services to 1 individual in that area with limited access to therapy resources. Additionally, the MS Communication Disorders program is focusing efforts on recruiting students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This expands the inclusion of Spanish-speaking students, which allows more reach to Spanish-speaking individuals with Parkinson's disease, a group that is underserved in the community.

Time allotted for make-up or additional sessions, as needed. - Timeline will repeat with dates for Spring 2024/Summer 2024 semesters. This includes continued marketing and accepting new individuals to the program. Do you plan to continue the program after the grant period? Yes If yes (to the above), please provide a brief explanation. (open answer, max 1000 characters) Yes, speech therapy services at the ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic for individuals with Parkinson's disease will continue after the grant period. The clinic will seek continued funding to keep services free. This allows individuals without consistent or quality access to healthcare the opportunity to receive skilled speech therapy. This program is an established part of the available clinical rotations in the MS Communication Disorders graduate program. It provides quality therapy to individuals with Parkinson's disease and offers a unique learning experience for speech-language pathologists in training. Indicate the number of individuals you attend to reach (please provide an estimated number only): Annually, the program intends to serve between 15-20 people with Parkinson's disease for individual therapy and retain a minimum of 18-20 people for group therapy. The program can include an unlimited number of their caregivers.  Implementation and Evaluation Public Facing Program Summary The ASU Speech and Hearing Clinic is utilizing the Parkinson Voice Project program to offer a specially developed two-part therapy program called SPEAK OUT! and LOUD Crowd. This program emphasizes speaking louder and with intent, techniques that can help adults with Parkinsons disease be more easily understood while also improving their physical health. A weak voice can lead to serious speech and swallowing issues.  Adults with Parkinsons are invited to take part in this free speech therapy program that improves voice volume and quality of speech. The two-part therapy program strengthens the muscles used for speaking and swallowing by combining individual speech therapy (SPEAK OUT!) with ongoing group therapy (The LOUD Crowd). The programs are provided in both English and Spanish and will be conducted online or in-person. We welcome caregivers to attend informational sessions and support their loved ones in this program. The Parkinson Voice Project developed this effective program to help people with Parkinson's disease speak and live with intent. Their important mission is to preserve the speech and communication of individuals with Parkinsons and related neurological disorders through continuous speech therapy, follow-up support, research, education, and community awareness. This program is based on the teachings of Daniel R. Boone, Ph.D., a world-renowned speech-language pathologist and voice expert who recognized in the late 1950s that individuals with Parkinsons could improve their communication if they spoke with intent. Evaluation plan (How will you evaluate your project and demonstrate its success at the end of the grant period, including any tools utilized): The following methods will be used to track individual progress in the program. - - - Speech Evaluation and Stimulability Testing are completed during the individual's first session. If the visit is in-person, decibels (dB) will be recorded using a sound level meter during various speaking tasks. The level of cues provided by the clinician will also be documented. If the visit is via telehealth, only the level of cues provided by the clinician will be recorded as there is no accurate way to measure dB virtually. This allows clinicians to document baseline measures of the individual's speech and voice. -  During the first session (in-person or telehealth), the individual's responses are audio-recorded while they are speaking at their baseline and while they speak with intent. This portion will be played back to the individual and their caregiver(s) to show the difference between their baseline voice and intentional voice. -  Data is collected and recorded during each therapy session. The clinicians will measure decibels (if possible), level of cues, and speech/voice characteristics (e.g., breathy, hoarse, wet). -  Discharge Evaluation is completed during the individual's final session. The same protocol from the first session is used to offer an objective measure of progress and change. The recording from the initial session is played back to the individual and their caregiver(s) so they can hear their speech/voice improvements in addition to seeing the data in a written report. Information is documented after each session on the clinic's electronic medical record (CounselEAR) and is protected by HIPAA. Individuals have access to their medical records and speech reports. Individuals are strongly encouraged to join the LOUD Crowd group. Continued data is tracked and if/when the individual has a decline in speech/voice function, it is recommended that they complete a refresher session of SPEAK OUT! individual therapy. The following methods will be used to track the program's outreach and attendance.  -  Number of individuals who complete the initial speech evaluation.  -  Number of individuals who complete the full 12-session program. -  Number of individuals who consistently attend the LOUD Crowd group after completion of SPEAK OUT! individual therapy. Consistent attendance will be considered attending at least 50% of available sessions. -  Number of individuals who participate in therapy in-person / telehealth. -  Number of individuals who participate in the program in English / Spanish / Bilingual. Another method of evaluation will be through the use of the 'Telepractice Satisfaction Survey' at the end of services rendered. Feedback collected from this survey is used for process improvements. The survey was reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) and has been used in the ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic since Summer 2020. Please see the attachments section for a copy of this survey. Measurable program goals (You will be expected to report on the progress against these goals in your reports): - Provide skilled speech therapy services (SPEAK OUT! individual therapy and LOUD Crowd group therapy) to at least 12 individuals with Parkinson's disease. - Distribute marketing material in English and Spanish to a minimum of 5 outlets. - Recruit a minimum of 3 individuals with Parkinson's disease who designate Spanish as their primary language. - Plan and host a minimum of 2 'Open House' events at the ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic to promote skilled services, provide education to individuals and caregivers, and celebrate client participation. Proposed outcomes and impact of the program: The College of Health Solutions' charter sets the tone for the powerful outcomes and the positive impact this program has on the community. The College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University is committed to translating scientific health research and discovery into practice. We prepare students to address the challenges facing our populations to stay healthy, improve their health and manage chronic disease. We bring people together to improve the health of the communities we serve, reaching them where they live, learn, work and play throughout their lifespan. This program, established by the Parkinson Voice Project, is evidence-based and proven to be effective in the treatment of individuals with Parkinson's disease. Participants frequently report the positive impacts that 'speaking with intent' has on their lives. This includes improved communication with loved ones, boosted self-confidence, and increased social interaction. The frequent referrals made by former participants demonstrate the beneficial impact this program already has on the community. Individuals consistently come together in group therapy sessions to exercise their voices and improve their relationships through the power of communication and camaraderie. The positive impact of this program reaches multiple people. Individuals with Parkinson's disease experience the benefit of quality speech therapy services and their loved ones enjoy the benefits of their partner's increased confidence and communication. Additionally, graduate students experience hands-on learning to improve their clinical skills. As a part of the College of Health Solutions' mission and values, we aim to prepare tomorrow's leaders in healthcare. We hope to maximize opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives. This program fully supports these aspirations.  Outreach What is your plan for marketing your program to the community? The Parkinson Voice Project has educational and marketing materials available for trained clinicians. This includes brochures, educational diagrams for explaining the extrapyramidal and pyramidal systems, presentations, t-shirt designs, bookmarks, and flyers. Additionally, the ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic has individualized material available. This includes flyers and goods for marketing to physicians and Parkinson's groups (e.g., coffee tumblers, pens, and eyeglass cleaning kits). A direct mail campaign will be completed to target individuals who would benefit from this program. Social media campaigns will also be completed to increase awareness of the program and outreach to individuals who do not live in the Phoenix metropolitan area but are candidates for telehealth services. The program will seek publication in local newsletters and magazines (e.g., ASU News, local parks and recreation newsletters, and local senior center publications). Outlets to send marketing material include but are not limited to the following: - - - Local speech-language pathologists and outpatient therapy clinics (e.g., Maria Camacho and Sarah Glenn).  Local neurologists who serve individuals with Parkinson's disease (e.g., Dr. Mahant and Dr. Kuniyoshi). -  ASU faculty conducting research on Parkinson's disease (e.g., Daniel Peterson and Jeffrey Kordower) Social media: College of Health Solutions, ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic, and local speech-language pathologist networking accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). -  Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona Speech and Hearing Clinics. -  Robin Rhea with the Parkinson's Foundation. Describe your outreach plan for reaching diverse populations. Programs should provide care services, education, and support for diverse populations (such as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino, and LGBTQ+ populations). Going forward, marketing material will be distributed in Spanish. According to 2019 U.S. Census data, 725,394 Hispanic individuals reside in Phoenix, Arizona. While not all of these individuals are Spanish-speaking, it is clear that this is a large population within our community. The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic Parkinson Voice program aims to increase access to diverse populations. As mentioned in the program description, the Masters of Science in Communication Disorders program is actively working to increase the enrollment of students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This aims to expand the inclusion of Spanish-speaking students, which allows more reach to Spanish-speaking individuals with Parkinson's disease.  When distributing marketing material, efforts will focus on areas geographically close to diverse and underserved populations. Additionally, marketing material will be sent to other state university speech and hearing programs to increase the program's visibility and access to individuals outside of the Phoenix metropolitan area.  The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic offers gender-affirming voice treatment. This has increased the clinic's visibility in the LGBTQ+ community and the marketing material will be distributed to this population. Describe your outreach plan for reaching people with varying levels of health literacy, those who may be financially challenged, isolated populations, or populations with limited access (i.e., care partners, young onset, women with PD, veterans, etc.). The ASU Speech & Hearing Clinic plans to distribute marketing material to a variety of outlets as described above. This includes an emphasis on locations that have access to underserved populations. Healthcare outlets such as the Maricopa County Hospital and the Veterans Affairs Phoenix Healthcare System will support the opportunity to reach people from all backgrounds. Marketing material will be published in an infographic format to increase accessibility for those who have lower literacy or health literacy levels. Increasing connections to others involved with Parkinson's disease in the community will also allow for increased opportunities to reach a variety of people. Continued participation in events such as the Moving Day Walk and Parkinson's Revolution Ride will increase the clinic's overall visibility and therefore increase access to people from all financial, educational, and accessibility levels.

The grant project, Expanding Dementia-Capable Home and Community-based Services and Education in Central Arizona, is designed to assess home-based and community-based services and training to support the care of dementia patients in Central Arizona. Hospice of the Valley is a leader in hospice and dementia care services. The impact of these services will be assessed by examining several measures, such as caregiver reports of patient behaviors, stress surveys, and hospitalization data. If the implemented services are shown to be effective in reducing the stress of caregivers of dementia patients, the benefits could be replicated in other communities and facilities. This project is taking place in Hospice of the Valley facilities in Central Arizona, and the Hospice of the Valley team collects the data.  In her role on this project, Tamiko Azuma will support the program by evaluating the project data, determining and conducting the appropriate analyses on the data, and assisting the research team at Hospice of the Valley (HOV) in the development of journal manuscripts.

FP00037418,930,,,,,1,,,"Project Summary: Cedars-SinaiEarly influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates improve public health response. Influenza has a significant global impact on public health each year even after the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, the illness affects over 35 million people, causes 710,000 hospitalizations and about 47,000 deaths per year 2. The strongest public health response to this is the annual vaccine, planned and manufactured several months ahead of the flu season. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) makes recommendations for vaccine content and then national agencies select the most appropriate strain3. The effectiveness of the vaccine varies from year-to-year and even within the same season. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) data guides the response of state and local public health agencies to influenza epidemics and pandemics. Specifically, VE estimates impact the success of vaccination campaigns, allow agencies to estimate the number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by influenza, and to implement targeted complementary public health control measures and outreach campaigns if the VE is low4. Official VE estimates by the CDC come out late in the season and sample only a few states. The CDC estimates VE annually through the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network5 (US Flu VE Network). While the CDCs efforts to track flu cases (FluView 6) and vaccination rates (FluVaxView 7) -not VE-, collect data continuously from hundreds of sites, the US Flu VE Network5 runs only at participating clinics in a limited number of  states, with each site  enrolling around 1,000 participants with influenza-like illness (ILI) each year as a part of a test-negative design (see Figure 1). VE estimates are reported by the CDC at the end of each season, with an interim estimate published by the end of February or later. Thus, the CDC estimates are the US gold standard, but have two main limitations: (i) the VE studies include only a limited number of states and subjects, and (ii) the interim report is not published until late into the flu season. In this work, we propose to use social media (SM) data for addressing these limitations.SM is abundantly available across the US in near real-time and can be used as complementary data for calculating VE. Unlike when monitoring for flu or ILI cases 8-15, calculating VE requires longitudinal mining of cohort data for the test-negative design. Based on separately funded work (R01LM011176), we propose automated methods to identify a large cohort of Twitter users that report taking a flu test or a diagnosis of flu, and capture their tweets over time to determine vaccination status, test results, and demographic information. We have shown that SM data collected using this systematic Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach can be used for epidemiology and, per the latest Pew report, is representative of the population. We can thus use these data to produce accurate VE estimates early in the influenza season.",
